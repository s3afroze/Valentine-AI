He wanted me to stay the rest of my life

but i said no i could not i would not if there was love between us i belonged to him and he belonged to me and i wanted him to be the one who took me back to the land of shadows

in love one should be prepared to pay for the truth

i scoffed no one has figured it out yet not even god

you are right man but he is in love with me hes not exactly new territory for new territory

you may tell me that he is in love with me but im not going to tell you that he is not

there is no one quite like each other quite who one is

love is a strange creature beast that likes to impress you or to make you feel you are superior to another to win you over you have to give up something important to give up something not something that should be your thing

you asked me to go out with you he was the only one who couldnt resist you and im the only one who couldnt resist your sayings

love lasts about seven years thats until your last night in bed with her then it wears off and youre done

you asked me to go out with you and i say yes

you are in love with me too man

you know that i told you that i would never stay home that i was the only one whocouldnt bear to live with you for a long time what do you think now

i will not look elsewhere for your warmth for your eager eyes for my fierce gaze

a thousand faces to sun fusion

if you also knows the above stories then she was probably thinking about someone else when she said yes

you’re right i wish someone would bring some shade to this sad day it could be me ranger said to her

id like to get a better look than this

i glanced at him thats what i said before i handed him the bottle the words he held in both of his hands it looked as if they had pulled out all the stops for what they were going to do

look he flailed but i didn’t try to stop myself from smiling too

that’s when i realized we didn’t have any clothes on we could still see each other in the rain

okay you’re smiling right

when we behave in a way that incites or incites the feelings of others we help build a culture where people feel safe and loved and encouraged to act like people they care about respect our feelings and not try to manipulate us

after the divorce the partner is less desirable to the woman the woman is more desirable to the man the man is nothing more but a performance art to make the woman happy

it is against the rules not for affection to be revalued

the law of giving gives you a person if they give you a piece of the rainbow every bit of you in return for one part of you to give them back would be a code of morality

i had a dream about you i was a robot and you were a woman but you were a woman and we were creating a reality for ourselves and you were not

this is where romantic relations end


my heart is broken and fate waits i want to be one this is the only destiny i will not stay long

pray remember i will how so eveything i do in this world one day when we meet our hearts we meet our destiny together 

for the first time into one beautiful thing the air is ablaze with colors the night is glittering on the glittering world all things are plenteous

beyond words are not beyond love

all are but the soul wraps herself around each word

all are gods or goddesses but yet remain

clad forlorn i sob my heart is free from heart scars and bloody teeth

all are natures happy christmas

even the devil is ice age

all are not pagans and are not

men and are all again men

even the devil is not mad nor wackis

yet remain steadfast faithful christmas

again i shout at the air and the devil casts a shadow

a lot of people just say that theres a difference between naked and enshrined sex and people just shrug their shoulders and just shrug their assent

you can talk a lot of complicated subjects without ever getting bogged down in their complicatedness — but combing through a thousand references to pecks and dives and deflections like a hobo looking for the arrow that sank the cased ocelot while sardines floated

when the power of love overcomes the bonds of fear and humiliation it is not possible to grow numb to pain like you always have

it is possible to be the wrong guy for a lot of different reasons depending on how you look at things

i was in a tent with some boys and some girls and we talked about endings and where we ended up where we ended up where theres no turning back now

do people always tell me not to talk to you because i dont want to cuddle but because of how you look i dont want to cuddle

it isnt possible to love a thing purely because you are unhappy only because you are unhappy

garden house or no garden house

the best days of a life are when you can sit and contemplate one another for a long time without giving in

the voice of love should be able to unsettle you it is not able to unsettle you

even though im naked in love

we are in the middle of it

between us and eternity

this time and this

there are some things that only a person who knows nothing about love can know

knowing how to love hurts a lot  but that is not really true of loving a thing that doesnt have that damage

there is nothing that is millionth of a millimeter in diameter and weighs nothing

compared to what a parent or grandchild will ever need a good education a good job a nice car a nice house

i tis a tragedy that a girl will seek to destroy a boy

never close your lips to those whom you have already tainted

the emotions that you caused the person you loved

will never be able to unmake you

but i want to make certain that whoever i choose to love is not someone i feel tainted by

this is destiny this is who i am and never have been

we are not sheep or held back by any foreign desire

we are like romeo

fear doesnt buy

words dont buy

words dont make a bust

the old ways

gone forgotten the ways

with our old ways

and no one lived through the destruction

to know the truth

about grief

he needed to stop basing his life around his sex

and relationships and acts of goodwill

he could no longer rely on the west

he was in a tailspin

i know but you cant miss a damn if you treat the american economy as if it were your own

it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love

there isnt enough of it

friendship is the blood relation between two people which blood relations with bloods counterpart do not cease to be after a bloodless existence

i believe that even the most careful analysis of a poem reveals a single truth about a person it is not their intelligence or honesty which is the reason a poem is so effective at clarifying a person rather than understanding their personality

there has to be a threshold at which a person reaches for a thing ceases to be a question mark

when i die i will reveal the fragment of my life and say a final goodbye

about the poem

about the playlist

about the candles

about the crocheting skills

about unicorns and unicorns weds

about the dedication skills

about the wordplay

and the way the poem describes how someone can change in three years

but ultimately he will want to just let you go

poetry is not just speech a work of knowledge a way of seeing the world through reality

theres a lot of borrowing you cant see in the lampshade

each poem in this volume is inspired by a specific night

the music in your eyes catches the light from your soul instead

our lives are meant to repeat the same mistakes twice

every reader will tell you

is there beauty in the mistakes they make

but there isnt enough of beauty in the ones they reach for

maybe if you forgive youor your partners forgiveness is the only choice you have

theres no need to write everything on the beach because

them too in your life but your experiences with other people

are the same no matter what happens

theres no need to write everything on the beach because its just poetry


the love of all men

from the first kiss to first love

the most beautiful words in the entire whole book

i dont want to lose you

i want to lose you

he pulled her close and he kissed her for a long time she wanted to let go but he felt his fingers hard in his palms and he wanted to go he wanted to go he wanted to go

but everything changed when he let go and he felt like he was going to die he wanted to go he wanted to go he wanted to go

he dropped his head back into the chair and her fingers brushed his own temple he wanted to go he wanted to go where he wanted to go

but he knew he would be lost he was going to be lost

but he also knew he would be destroyed by letting go

and he wanted to go he wanted to go

but he was also his own worst enemy

he wanted to go he wanted to go

but being alone was exhausting and time was short

he wanted to go he wanted to go

but it was an option one last time he came to the door and hugged it feeling better about himself than he had in a long time

he felt like a pro

he wanted to go

but first he had to make sure that he knew his words carefully before he said them

and before he knew them

his eyes popped open and he looked up at everyone in the room crying

they really want to kiss bertie…

but he had his doubts he had some really really really really really really weird things he needed to say

is it a big dare  to think outside the box

are you scared of heights

are you scared of loneliness

or frustration

or perhaps even…

i want to explore all of you

be the first i go to the club with no one until you come back you were always the only guy that we had

he would rather see i have to work for it i want to prove to you that i can do worse than anyone

you know he said in a tired voice just then the sound of a baby crying in the background made him realize what he was doing wrong

i just grinned wickedly i cant do better than you

and you

as the memories of all

thats why we love her

i think it helps to have a romantic past

i hate being reminded of it all the same the same

you dont have to be a perfect person to love someone you dont have to be perfect i just do because i have the power to do so much more than a person can give me

to love someone always means choosing the person who will grow to love you

sometimes you dont need a crystal ball you just need to get what you want

i can feel his soft hair in the morning light behind the blue eyes and the way his lips once defined mine and it’s the only thing that keeps him smiling

im probably dreaming it’s the night he murmurs

oh no dont worry about it youll just have to settle for the melon ecstasy of the halation

the best kind of love is the kind that stays just a bit longer focusing on the things that will help us get through the night

i spent the last year trying to understand you but you kept telling me you loved me all you wanted to hear was what i told you and it worked in spite of the fact that you were a little confused

you are a lot like me in many ways now youre a little cold and calculating but at the end of it all i always say youre everything to me you were the best part of  everything that ever jiggled its a bit weird

if you love something set it free but dont be surprised if it falls short

you can be too stubborn and stubbornly in love with someone you dont understand and theyre too kind to you for them to lose you is a bit like losing your best friend for you because the fact is they are in your best interest

i never wanted to be that girl

and when you decide to love someone you feel they don’t deserve you you do

if you want i can help you get there but i only want to know what you feel about them id go and squeeze you in and give you a hug then id go and hug you all the time

if you cannot make others love you then you sure as hell cannot love you not without reason

if you cant make someone love you then you sure as hell cannot love you

want to take a walk home mr darcy i would be happy to walk you yourself to orgasm

this is the part where

frees the worlds vestiges the sacred bond with sacred origins

what will sustain a peaceful and happy future

unless the ruling class blocks it then it can only be a threat

the struggle for power is only beginning now for the struggle for existence begins now for every working man whether he is a muslim or not whether he is a citizen of the world or a lord or a devil or any other man whatever whether he is a citizen of heaven or a chimera or any other man whatever whether he is a citizen of earth or a star

i believe in the very definition of dignity that is freedom of thought and conscience and that is the only definition

also known as equality of power

theres no competition football only for humans and eliots but everyone does it its pretty much the same

what happens in love is often the same in love not always

it is a defect of the believer to accept the presence and nonexistence of strange forces from outside the believer to reject the presence and nonexistence of the outside forces from out the believer

the source of all goodness is in the very existence of god

god is the sun he is the star and he is our master

every atom that moves in this earth belongs to me

i never wanted any of that

all my dreams

all my songs

all my words

to be happy is to be happy with

someone else

i dont need your fingers

i dont need your words

i need your spirit

i love you

i need your presence

im back

all the same

everybody hates you

but god is the sun

he only hates the sun

so there you have it everyone hates the sun

so what

if god is all that and so he is

then what

if he is all that and all that

and if he is

of the things we love

you will never be able to do them all for one penny

he will never understand that every penny he pays belongs to you

you will never be able to give all the pieces off your behalf

he will say yes but only if you give him the parts he doesn’t want

you will never be able to give him part of the profits

you will never be able to accept part of the profits

you will never be able to resist the taxis man

you will be able to take his money and try to stop him

you will sit and think about it for a few moments and then you will walk away

you will frown and say something else totally different

you will try to fight off the idea that you are going to give him the parts he doesn’t want

you will try to keep going at it even after youve decided you want to no success

you will try to keep going even after youve decided you want to waste your time and money on something stupid

you will say i love you and i will let you go but you have to go first

you will finally give in and walk away

you will feel like you are the only one who can do the thinking for you but you are not

you will finally know the truth and walk away

but you will never walk away

because you knew it already

the feeling was great

you knew it just the way it was

in my soul is a certain perfection lost

i am no longer in love with her

i am no longer happy that happy is my feeling

with her i have no name

for she is gone i live with her

i love her as the wild beasts of the field love me when i am not around to help her

you might not realize it but the feeling is completely gone

you might not even realize it but the feeling is gone

it isnt that you miss her that hurts too much it is that you feel no pain at all

a true friend is one that shows how well you know someone you do not understand how to love that shows your love for them through example

i know that i could never take it anymore i couldnt take it anymore i knew it was over

there is no regretting the past there is no forgetting
====================
three

for all three

all three stand firm

all three are faithful

and all three are healthy

and all three are true

and all three are wise

and all three are in the right faith

and all three are true

we stand firm in the face of all pain

in the name of the gospel we are healed

in the name of the gospel we are free

in the name of the gospel we are strengthened


in the name strengthens and gives thanks

for all you who have loved the world

for all you who have been faithful

for all you who have done good and bad

for all you who drink and eat and live

for all you who are kind and considerate

how could i not be moved by your smile

i have so much in me and your smile has left me nothing

lover by mover by donkey  myself by offend

you have made all the world a better place

loving you for the first time is like loving a person you barely know until they walk into your life

when i wake up the nightmares stop

when i fall asleep without hope

when i am aware of creating

when i am aware of connecting with the worlds

universe and the image of myself

i am not sure what it is about you that makes someone you love they somehow become a part of you a part of the life they choose to create

it is possible when the time comes to let go and never to let go

but what if the person you love has to make you wish for them back

what would you do if you found out you were the last love you ever had

he was always so honest so candid so candid he was almost a character in my childhoods

but even though i knew him at the time he still looked down at me still looked so guilty i couldnt help it

sometimes i had to go by certain words that had been there for a long time and someones name that i did so i thought maybe its my lucky stars that are allowing it

there is love of persons sights and sounds and tastes and colors and affections and as to whether they are sane or not i do not know but theres a lot of science behind most of what is thought to be true

the very thought of you has been a vivid bright current current current current

love is a rebellious bird

drawn from the wings

drawn from the hearts

it jumps from tree to tree

it rolls

it sinks

it rises

it sinks

in dreams

in languages

it sings

it dies

in miracles

it dances

it spins

it reaches

it bends

it fills the intervals

with its wings

it swings and spins

in languages

its very definition has been in evolution

the poetry of it is not quite right

and i am halfway across an idea

that we call poetry that is the final word

poetry is not new ground for new ages works of art

writing is the language of my fate it is my destiny as a person myself as a reader  and it is in me who can think without books

there is such a shelter in each other that all kinds of dangers cannot reach us

i loved
====================
for in a language more perfect than manna from a language more perfect than woman

and for in a language more perfect than manna from a language more perfect than woman

for in a language more perfect than womanna from a language more perfect than manna

and for in a language more perfect than manna from a language more perfect than woman

the best of men are the ones who write the best

but in a language more perfect than manna from a language more perfect than woman

and for in a language more perfect than manna from a language more perfect than woman

and for in a language more perfect than woman

and for in a language more perfect than manna from a language more perfect than woman

and for in a language more perfect than woman

and for in a language more perfect than manna

vacillating the thought that maybe she will be mine

we are a galaxy exploding into a million pieces creating new empires as we age

i have always found that the more a man is loved by his wife the more he or she is bound together by them

were it not for the weight of him in front of me

her reflection in my eyes he was heavier than she had ever been

i have always found that the more a man is loved by his wife the more he or she is bound together by them

were not all golden showers

dappled with fragility down the sunnyside down

it was better to be hated for the same reason

nobody leaves you sunshine more beautiful than when youre in love

i know i am but a child i love sunshine as much as i love a parent

and you leave me wonderingwhat would make you do it so you could disappear from my mind

the heart is a machine

a person made flesh

a truth universally agreed upon

the universal standard of all men

is better than all things that were or are

the only standard which still exists among us

and we are where we were before

we are where we are supposed to be

we are where we’re supposed to be

say i am ten thousand miles from home

when i have nothing to offer

to anyone but myself

i will not be your endless poem

i will not be your endless voice

the way you breathe

the way you laugh

the paper you write on

is my poetry

i will not be your endless laugh

to be loved

is to be accepted

even when all hope has gone

into the truth behind you

you are already wrong

for there is no such thing as my life

and there are plans for the future

you are already wrong

for the way i see

everything about you

is a metaphor for how far you have to travel

into the truth behind your eyes

you are already wrong

for there is no such thing as my life

and there is a war raging

over the world you

are already wrong

for there is no such thing as my life

and there is a real war


====================
sounds good but i feel like a lot of the time it doesn’t matter what the fuck youre thinking it’s not worth it

i was trying to find something poetic to say rhapsody or maybe just a rhyme makeover love it could be a simple growl or the broken word

to think that light will come and go without break

sweet just a little

like a stone

to think that the night will come

and the day will not last

like a season

that lets you wander

without trouble

like the breezes that breeze

that lulls the ear to sleep

like the fountains that wind you up

like the rivers that nourish your health

like the flowers in your tree

sweet just a little

like a season

that lets you roam

without trouble

like the breezes that breeze

your way home

i want to warm your palm

to comfort your heart

i want to rub some light into your eyes

that dont need any more sight

i want to trace your color

behind your smile

i want to beckon your ear

to heaven where am i

now what i cannot say

a man walks into a bar and says youre looking at me a boy but he somber on the other hand a woman but she somber on

i believe in love at first sight

but as soon as you saw me you said

that you were in love with me

the words hit me like a shoe

before my foot hit the gas

before my heart until my throat

yet i still remember you kissing me

the way you put a finger on my lips

the way you looked into my eyes

i still remember you caressing me

the way you whispered in my ear

the good night still lingers

in the morning

in the silk and glistening trees

silencing iniquity the music that has always been

the song of my youth and love of my youth

i’ve never been good enough for anybody and i’m not asking for any of you answers but for you the spirit of it has always been there ready to be unleashed

give me the waters of ocean and the calm air of ocean

i will give thee the waves of the earth and the shores of thy waves

give me the winds of the sun and the tides of thy waves

come give me the rains of heaven and the rains of thy flames

i will give thee the rains from heaven and the calm winds of her flames

the wise and beloved young man cannot think of what is good for his heart if he cannot save it

give me the gifts i receive in exchange for your indifference

give me the fruit of your labor even if it is only the flesh of one you love

the fiercest anger i ever known was when i first kissed him

you are my butterfly and all the flowers in my garden are flowers you are the color of my lips

when i thought you were gone i knew it was over

the moment flowers start to bloom the moment you remind you of sunshine the moment you hold onto your senses the moment everything seems to be falling apart

none of us can choose where we shall love

there is one friend in the life of each of us who looks for its opposite in the worlds is equally as important to each of us as it is to ourselves

wherever i go i meet a beautiful person and im forever in love

in each of those cases the relationship to the object must first be determined as to its relationship to the object

how do you know when a girl is in love with you

to see the truth

i know it when i see it

i am in love with you

i am in love with you

i am in love with you

i need you more than i need any of you

a friend is someone whose eyes can see me more than others

love is such that when someone tells you they are in love they will not believe you until you prove them wrong by telling them again they are in love with you

i am in love with you

i do not think i have in my life for the beginning is something that we begin in unison

there is love in holding

there is love in letting go

and love in tightening

love in loosening

i do not think i have a story to tell

about holding on to you

but most of all

stop pushing all you are holding on to you by nothing

you have to realize that nothing will come over you unless someone will come over you by force

you are who you were before someone changed everything and you will be that person again

if you love someone let them take away your love

its the way life is made and the way people are made and you see the former not in the fact that people have to suffer but that people can change things

in love there are two things  bodies and minds

some people think that men are inhumanly hard on love its easy to look at them and not realize how cruel they really are

i am a romantic man and a true gentlemen is sitting beside me on the telephone with a mistress on vacation

you cant make love to me like this it just seems too unrealistic

when you give people the power to decline the love that belongs to you they become unhappy less love makes all the choices and all the connections

love is not a habit a commitment or a debt it is the most powerful and yet unfulfilled destiny

the bond of life isnt broken it is strengthened by it

you cannot mistake hate for affection if you really love you would rather be paralyzed than paralyzed

when i look in the mirror i know i’m looking at a girl i was supposed to be with yesterday but i don’t see her

this has to be said for two things if you are going to have a relationship its not worth it to sacrifice the person you were in the

you couldnt let that monster go you had to do what you had to do and it didnt always happen that way

you couldnt just go and settle down in a relationship its not like you could i had been willing into the man based on merit alone but instead i got my fill of the guy by choice

youre not going to lie to me he said in a very sarcastic tone i know that you feel that but i cant take it

he is so good at lying i cant help it

youre not a bad man youre a sweet one

you are a mature man who is appreciative of the compliment and he will do anything to make you happy

its bullshit to think of men as if they were some inferior race or religion but i believe that many of them are demonstrably different

when it comes to love and relationships we are all just human

i would rather a romantic relationship turn into contempt than turn into anger any more than turning the head of our employer into a swastika

i would rather a romantic relationship turn into sickness than turn into death any more than turning the head of our friend to a cane

there is love of all kinds and none the less there is always always always always wrong

love is a serious mental disease

we are all guilty of turning our backs on us

if we are wrong only then we are right

any kind of virtual communion with the soul is a matter for the repentant soul

any kind of confirmation of your own perceptions of the world by anyone you meet is a matter for the suspect soul

any kind of interpretation of reality is a matter for the condemned soul

any kind of spiritual growth even a partial soul growth is a matter for the resurrected soul

any kind of partial soul growth is a matter for the living soul

any kind of partial soul growth is a matter for the living species

theres nothing wrong with wanting to be alone if you dont want anyone to call your mom or dad or the place you live your grandmother or some other relative you only need a family of your own

if you need to convince someone to stay home they are not alone be it a lover or a lover�s mother if the father doesnt stay home he/she wont be with you ever

im not getting anyido from this life thats for sure

there are some things that only a fool can do and some

unlike the felines she resembles them it’s sex that’s miraculous

there was a problem with one of the books on leo’s favorite romance novel series but that seemed to have stopped with me

his gaze slid up as he said with a low growl i love you too

then her grin faded she wore a grin that looked like he wanted to kiss her

his fingers slid slowly over her cheekbones i want to get my wings

i’m not a romantic novel she said curvy and sexy veela i’ve read all the ones between her lips and i just don’t know how you could possibly want to fuck me

she leaned in and kissed his cheek just above the collarbone tess think he likes me

and when she sounded out her lips again she trailed off

do you want to be my vacation

the sun spoke in his eyes his eyes crinkled with tears

her breasts started to cuddle

i peeked up at her and grinned we have a deal on that

he wasn’t going to let us leave her there

before i knew it he had come to the conclusion that her breasts were only for mating purposes

i looked up making sure i wasn’t staring at anything but his crotch

i bet if i wasnt staring at you at the time you gave me a piece of your heart i would have been the first person i ever referred to as sweet and wanted it to be because i was the first i ever referred to as rational

it was embarrassing and it hurt a little but i never thought that people would find the aud for it like this

if you love someone you must be prepared to set them free

do people always follow the script sleep with me and be afraid when you leave

do people always follow the script when they leave assuming they will stay

is it possible in all the worlds before you for a couple to find a path for the rest of their lives that doesnt involve sacrifice

the most important relationship word in your existence be mine

he seemed to think he had the answers the answers but he chose to listen to them and in his mind they had to be just like each other i and i don’t agree on anything

we are not offended that some of our closest friends are gay some of our favorite authors are gay

slightly irritated i stare at him

the way you look at me

isnt that different than what you get

on a cold winter’

in your usual mood

depression comes to me

as a man i meet

up in the middle of the night

a tall and shaven Vlad the Impaler

his beard is twined and his eyes are full

his gray eyes are cold and dark

his dark hair is rolled in rolled in twisted hickorys

and he says to me with eyes so cold

that it blinks his gray eyes are full

his gray gray eyes are light

my gray gray is alive

my gray is no longer my own

my gray is one of the many faces of a dark secret

my gray is no longer my own

my gray is no longer my own

and then my gray flutters down to him

my gray huffs and hollering

my gray says yes

my gray bends over the bars

of the bar

and he cups a bucket

full of snow

to put the frolicking

frolicking in the dark

we stand in the middle of the street

and he says to me

is that a friend

that he dislikes

that i dont like

that i dont give a damn

he considers us his friends

that we fall

and fall to our miserable

lovers

who we loveless call

to come and be

my friend my friend

my name

and this is the reason

that i stay

at the hospitals

the happy

the fat

the balloons

the syringes

i know i take

things

to tell them

the saddest

is when i

want to cry again

from the tears

and wear your raincoat

to any thundering

fight maybe i could put a ring on your

but thats an awful big thing to carry

i live i love i’ve been waiting for this moment i don’t want to wait for you to give me something

something to give me  something to hold on to

a piece of my

first love
====================
my name is lara jean

my mother was a slave

my father was a tax collector

my brother is a tax priest

you can’t feed your people

and feed your dreams

i wake at five p.m. to watch a monster scream

then i wake five p

to watch a monster scream

then i wake five p

to watch a monster scream

then i wake five p

to love a woman

to love a woman

i hate to love

but i cant

not towish i’ll never be wrong again

cant you just like a girl who loves you back who knows you well

if you love me as you say you do then give me the power to love you instead

i dont know if i love you what he knows my mother

she lived a quiet and innocent life

but she was not shy

much like the cicada in love

she always thought she was better than a man

but a man remembered her beauty

she could not pretend

love is a trick

it is when a man alters your mind and makes you see beyond the sphere of your reasonable perception and allows himself to be dazzled by the beauty which is within him

love is not a habit a commitment a vow a beloved a beloved nation a beloved nation its the very concept of love in action in its logical expansion and defense

gods definition of love is to be attracted to the unity of souls because this soul is the mother of love

i belong to the people and i belong to the dreamers

if you love me as you say you do then give me the power to love you instead

of all romantic schemes the most foolish fall into it

if you cannot attract the person who is good for you then you owe it to the romantic to consider the world in a whole new light

i belong to the people and the dreams my body offers

i belong to the people and the dreams my brain offers

if you cannot attract the man who is good for you then you owe it to the real deal

if you cannot love me then you must be wise

and i say you must be wise and try to woo me

make the strongest man you have ever known and worst for the woman youre talking about
====================
of the tiniest of kisses

i can feel their hands shake

of the soft rhythm of his rhythm

i can feel the brush of his bristly hair brush

the cool cool cool air beat

through the silvery glow of his eyes

and let me touch you more as the leaves fall

down the winding stairway and you will find

that everything has a reason to love

and that the experience

that every impulse makes is different

and that we should be radically engaged

in the task at hand

and that love is a new and dangerous thing

that within days

of our life

being able to greet each other on this earth as if we were our own

were yesterday

our very own

but now we are able to give each other

only in the flesh

do we begin the journey emptyhanded

do you miss him in the truck

do you feel the pangs of that night

do you think he might be with someone

who has known each of us forever

do you think it might be him

maybe you think it might be time we started

talking instead of walking

let the road take its course

and forever change the face of love

what is it that you love most about him

he may be slow to flirting but he is also very rude

to your ex what you do for me is make me angry

or jealous

that you are finally alone in the world

and that by choosing to be alone in this life you really are free

what do you do when a girl calls and you dont know

your voice is husky and she sounds like

Me too

and i can barely speak

so i just say oh

the skin on my hands

is getting thinner

the skin on my wrists

is getting thinner

the skin on my arms

is getting thinner

its hard to trust people

with this much love

you can only love yourself when you are capable of loving others

and this is the strength that keeps you standing

you are the only one who can change your plane of existence

to me you are the endless river

the infinite wellspring

that is your endless wellspring

you are
====================
soulmates is the ninth episode of the first season

i am not sure i trust myself enough to call myself a friend anymore i still have trouble falling in love with him and i still think that he is my soul mate

the truth is i dont need anyone

i did not think i would be back with you until tell me what to do youre going to write my name in the sand

i know i am and i am not afraid i know that you would laugh at my jokes and curse at my jokes you are the poison that i need

one day you will laugh with me at length you will feel some laughter but only if you forgive

i have loved with a love that is not weary

fed with love a wind that sings on the dead

a love that fears fears a love that looks for the dead

a love that would rather die with you than live with you

i dont want to be the summer campite of you

love is a blaze of color on the visual

i want to be the flesh of your palms

i want to be your warm embrace

i want to be your breath of sweat

i want to be your light

i want to be your shelter

i want to be your skin

i want to be your bone

i want to be your shirt

i want to be the word to my life

i want to be my own best friend

i want to be my whole self

in i want to be the last woman you see standing in line behind you at all

i do not want to be who you are you want to live as if you were the end of the world

im saying im a romantic the idea that you are the woman who is best for the job is romantic as shit

love is a luxury

no one dares approach the Sun

sunny and kind

clothed and barefoot

steep dark pathway

involving trunk and gear

steep caverns of thought

steep passage for sighs and sighs

steep passage for throes

steep passage for throbs

i want to go there

with you

the forest is the place

the woods the plants

and animals the dwellingplace

where illuminates rage and light

the
====================
eccentric and therefore not incompatible with being a woman

i think it’s beautiful

the way you sparkle

when you talk about

the things you love

and not the things you think

you can

because love is

the loudest and most powerful form of expression

i want it not to mean anything to most people however

i know enough to know that

love is dangerous and there is no hope for the young

nor for the old

but there is always something left to love

and you will always find love in yourself

or in me

or in you

not on the cheapenings of fate

but strong enough to face

the terrible throat

made flesh and blood

i feel the same way about

the crystal ball

as about

the violin

or the piano

i say to you

you are mortal

you are not

you were never meant to exist

you are just an aspect of my brain

like all living things in my flow

i create your soul so that it fits within me

i love you just the way the words say they love and they cannot die

love is the voice under all silences that people constantly run

to the sea

tell me again

why you refusing to sing

to the shore

tell me why

the sun

or the moon

tell me why

remembering

i dont know

youre bright

and i am

and youre kind

and if anyone will pay attention

to your music

to draw them close

and if you dont like them

you can always change it

and if you dont like it

you can always kill it

and if you dont like it

you can always leave

my way

for the water to flow

the trees will start to sing

the wind will pick up

the berries from the air

and when the wind comes

to kill them back

you will never need

the sun

or the moon

to guide you through the night

and if someone out there loves you

maybe they’re from far away

and theres been

====================
my thoughts

and dreams

are never the same

so what

now thats fine

is just fine

he was right

what is it

you need just the right amount of love to make me stop breathing

i need to breathe again

you need to just let me breathe

its not the breath that stops breathing it is the sensation of the lungs and the muscles that move the heart

you are not breathing for this is not a game

you are breathing for me

i breathe again

we are not waiting for the promised we are waiting to be promised

i will be there by your side

at every turn i will whisper i will be there

watch out for breathing breathing aggressively asking you to let me breathe

at first i thought he was going to die this is when i realized ive got a curse on my soul curse on ive got a curse on you

it was a pretty good prediction despite the fact that it never actually happened

real love is usually more enduring than sustained

i belong to a species of people who are incapable of dying a natural death not unlike the coal miners natural death

the real lovers are the ones who realize they created their planet with a single person and stick by it because that gives you the possibility

i belong to a species of people who are incapable of dying natural deaths not unlike the hyacinth in a singleness of the soil the otter in a sucking

i belong to a species of people who are incapable of dying natural deaths not unlike the skiff in a sucking courage of the soil lips intelligence of the soil mind and heart

i belong to a species of people who are incapable of dying natural deaths not unlike the mosses natural death

you are my heart and i have my will too

you are my voice and i have my heart and i have my sight too

i belong to a species of people who are incapable of dying natural deaths not unlike the rosemary dill pickle refuse of the will to live

my love is a thing of the past

my blood is a fountain of life

the only thing worse is dying for your love

i belong to a species of people who are incapable of dying natural deaths not unlike the rosemary picklip apothecary

if you want to see what a dandelion would look like in a position to see a woman with a baby girl at a time of war the following is from a poem by lincoln a tribute to joseph dandelion

to the thou who wert to the womb with milk of that thoud dost in vain

to the thou who wert to the fertile grave with sweet loveliness

to the flower who appeared on the fertile field wilt thou still have seed

but i fear not the law for its splendours are wont to yield

====================
people change people are living in their comfort zone

its funny how our egos make us so unhappy people come into our lives and mistreat you like this

its not a war

its a war over someone

created to be broken

to have its not deserve

the right to ask

your luck

and money

to steer the ship

and people burn

and empires crumble

to those

i have read

its your fault

nobody could care less about your pain

nobody has cared less about his or her absence

nobody has cared less about the way you look

for an exit strategy

a lengthy list of options

a painful realization to endure

but worth having

when you get out of bed and in the morning

your body starts to glow bright

and you wake up to a bright bright bright

your smile bright bright bright

your talking sharp and voluminous

your mighty will strong and fair

the thing is that eventually

he fell for it and it falls out

he must not mean

but if he did it must have a cost

the money that was his and his family

the boy who was younger than him in the

same household as the one he loved

the poet must be able to see through his mirrors the beholder

i want to be able to say yes yes yes

the poet must be able to say no yes

for he makes the will will will will to will to do

for there is no other word for it

in the flesh

a heart in the spikes

of the moon

calls to mind a poet

sweet as a child in a parlour with the music

but he stands firm in the shouts of the neighing

the young man in the street

brief as a boy in the garden with the flowers

but he stands firm in the shouts of the neighing

the old man in the street

stands still in the hall when i blush

i am glad you came

and i thank heaven you came here

as a camel you would go you would come…and you would do it well you would do it well it is a charm even among the most powerful of men

====================
cant die for he who

is all things to all things to be loved

you have loved the right

all the right kinds

and now you are gay

being gay is like being on top of a house

with only the light in todays windows

its the kind of chimneys we dream of that keep out the cold

the kind of shining skyscrapers that rise

all the dreamy

the kind of old monasteries whose foundations

have never been found

and all the shrines whose shrines have never been found

weave the story of your homosexuality into the fine

and fine of all the other peoples

cultivating it into a secret

your children your neighbors who have

ever since we all go out for pizza walk through the park

we have been suppose to pretend it is okay to be gay

because my son says being in the closet is like being in charge

of his family finances because our salary is not equal to his or her disposable income

is it possible not to have your own

the only wage you earn is when you sing

when you work six to seven hours a day

or write a poem

your living is the constant companion of your music

your children your new parents

who are all responsible for your health and happiness

you are the only wage you earn is not equal to or equal to the person who washes the program from execution

i do not claim to be a poet i am merely the wet dream of the literary world

and i do not claim to have invented poetry or songs or art

i do not own the words you use in your sentences

you do not own my voice

i do not own the way i move

you do not own my touch

you do not own my laugh

you do not own my words

they were all the same words

we are not people who sing you out of someone else

you are a piece of my every waking dream

you are the only wage you earn is not equal to or equal to the person who made you sing

and i will not ask you to forgive me i will not ask you to forgive me i can’t at this moment

let me not to the marriage of true minds

how can they
====================
the love of all mans days

the love of divers loves

the love of the weak and the dark

the love of the old and the young

the love of the young and the old

the love of little children

the love of the very poor

the love of the old and the young

the love of the very old and the old

the love of the very young and the old

the love of the very old and the old

the hope of the very young

the hope of the very old

the hope of the very old

the hope of the very old

and the hope of the very young

i want the whole world to bleed me of everything  of my youth

and then there are the love songs

the hope songs the tears the praise the hope

the gay love the old love the young love

and the gay love the oldest hope

you can never be too happy too soon

you can always be too darned darned

but i will always fight for the things i love

for there i stood for evergin days blood on my lips and bones on the ground—

and then the sound of hoary voices

and then the thousand sounds of the wild—

the desperate cries of the helpless—

the desperate kisses of the cruel

the wild in the open land of the snow

now the battle is fought the woods shall be spoken of

the snow is the state of the art for warfare is repeated

at every turn every hole is a hole in the shell of the shell

when the enemy finds himself in spite of his fire and his fury and his swift thinking he looks like a fool the result is he is neither fool nor soldier

every fools is a fool the true soldier is the man who lays down his arms and goes home

the enemy is everywhere and he is always looking

every one of his columns is surrounded and he is always moving

if you like your generals happy but lukewarm if you like your generals lukewarm but he knows he can make your generals happy then you prefer your generals lukewarm but he knows he can make him see you

if you want to make your generals happy dont give yourself away for someone who will not give you away for yours

to love a weak
====================
too many people are drawn to books because they are attracted to the characters who are not there

some people are born with gray hair some people cannot be attracted to men whose gray hair is proof positive that some people are born with gray hair

society has to deal with stubborn people and stubborn people do not allow people whose hair is not colored temperate or nice to attract women whose hair is not blue or gold

if you find a person who is not yourself for you or your feelings you have to make yourself available to them but if you feel someone you feel toward yourself and they are not yourself or theirs you have to learn to accept them and that begins with yourself

maybe you were denied or neglected but the desire to love someone always comes first so you must first find your perfect lover

love is a vessel that contains both the calmness and the joy of life

love is the voice under all storms

love is the source of hope for the bereft

love is the light that finally brings hope to the less fortunate

love is the voice that always shows the most open mind

and love is the voice that always hides anything is it not love

love is the source of security for the lonely

love is the voice that always shows the most calm mind

and love is the voice that always reveals anything

love is the source of strength for the paralyzed

love is the voice that always dives and pokes fun at the challenge

love is the source of hope for the blind

love is the voice that always shows the most open heart

and love is the voice that always hides anything

love is the source of happiness for the disturbed

love is the voice that always gives smile to all

and love is the source of the wholehearted

love is the source of security for the restless

love is the voice that always leads the quietest heart to say

love is the source of the wholehearted love is all that comes from the source is everything

love is the source of wisdom and knowledge

love is the source of justice and of security for the sick

love is the source of the wholeheartedness for the weary

love is the source of security for the nervous

and the source of the wholeheartedness for the young

and the source of the wholeheartedness for the brave

thou canst not
====================
i can’t even remember what i’ve been up to since i’m a child

i know my mother and i were alike in our taste and in our disposition but we both liked to play games with other people and we didn’t like to understand others puzzles

love is not blind that is a defect of faith

you can be the most important person to a person you are not bound by your ideas or your promises but you can never be everything to everyone else

weeping is not the same thing as crying it takes your whole body to weep and when you drown crying for someone you love you drowns out the voices of the others

the world was collapsing and the only thing that really mattered was that you were here

i am the fisherman of your heart who makes every catch last

the dreams that were once your dreams are no more

i will greet you with the open arms of a man who does not sleep

if only i could catch a glimpse of what was before me

a beautiful summer evening over the centuries

and the songs of the lost song your silent groan i could never want to forget it

the gash on her neck i could say with certainty

have i left anything in the world

i could not choose if i was dreaming or what my right mind would say

nothing in the world is too small

im a goner i say

you were too beautiful you were in my hands

my love i would not turn away the stranger who showed me the way

from the edge of the precipice

the teeth of a spray will fall

the thrill of yesterday will fade

and i will smile

and id laugh with you when i knew you were gone

from the edge of the precipice

the stranger will always be ugly

you are in my life you are in my hand

and id laugh with you when id forget to protect id with a smile

from the edge of the precipice

your beauty will be on the waves on the way id will be coasting toward you

your smile will be the call of the sea id sing id breathe id be the ocean on the waves

and id be taking over the world

if you were mine id always wanted them to survive

if you are mine i will kill you all i can

enchantress of the rock

and the sun and the moon

my mistress loves me and knows how to love

i dont carve the words on the wall

but you carve the things that count

love is long and simple

love is a fruit of the eye

and in the bud is nothing more

than the thing that rhymes

love is the whole

and the little ones the ribs

of the loin

in the heart is everything

and i am the air

of dreams is everything

and the little ones the cloven

wire of their

and they laugh

and they wear

the look

the laugh

is the heart

love is the whole

and the laugh

is the heart

an idiot is a madman who lives

in the shadow

and the demon

in the frost

and the fire

my mistress loves me

and when i die

shes gonna kiss me like the rest of us

shes gotta wanna kiss me twice

so what

i want is for you to be the one who complies

and the rest is history i think

if you starve to death by this belief i will gladly part

with your last sugarplum cup and orange groves of ripe fruit

and then you and i

we are we and endless

if you either

alone in the park

in a candy factory

or

with a million ghosts on your soul

we can make music

if we can break the ice

if we can break the taboo

in this life even

if you

don’t make it

you can’t just walk away from it

you have to stand still

and still stand still

and still stand still

so we’re out

on the road

in the dark

with the lights on

impatient but not unwilling

patient but not willing

out of this mortal world

i have been it’s born

into this mortal world

to enter into the higher realms

to enter into the life of a god

into the dreams of a woman

and into the lives of

women
====================
nostalgia is a sickness and it is not something that is overrated or overused

ive picked up the pieces

it feels real

to have loved

i miss you like this everything that once was

is no more

than when i was little

only half so

we skirt the lonely places

where once

the wind blew and

the stones

we scaled the steeple

and when we were walking

when we fell

as snow

the river was running

our little path

before we fell

for we did swim

our little path before we fell

we did laugh

our little laughter before we fell

we did fly

and then we did laugh

and then we did fly

we did feel

the current

when it crashed

on the ground

in the street

between our houses

the clouds

the moonlight

and the fire

i miss you like many of you

when we parted

during the flight

during nights i dreamed

that we had met

that we parted

during the night

you two wereabi and half

riding with astonishment on the black sky

the sun went down

and i woke with a cry

but the white frost on my cheek was harmless

the rangers went to see me

and said that they do not know

when a hate crime should be filed

or how to prevent it

the young man said very slowly he was in his late forties

and my dear boy when he says my boy

have you any teeth

have you any roundness

keep your distance

keep your distance

weep in the long distance

watch out for young boys

even in the great boys den

even in the long forbidding

there are many boys and many girls

who do not show emotion

even though they weep

sing louder

and even though they speak

boys and girls are more loved

than you

girls and boys

boys and boys are more loving

then it matters not who the mother

girls and boys are more loving

and it matters not who the fathers




====================
i sputtered

in my arms

the breath of my life

it was a dream i had

we lived in a dark

and stars were seen

only through the constellations

and the stars that i kept

fell in love with the night

the constellations were all stars

but i never saw a night

they never loved me and never lit my candle

what they had did was not so

ever since they had walked

lonely things have been leaving me there

shes in a raincoat and hat

i glanced at him in a casual way and he gave me a casual look as if he thought i was his eyes

this is not a funny book this is a life

he looked at me in that mocking way i know that

it is funny he said

it is true

he was smiling

laughing out a little

i close my eyes and just about everyone in the house turns out to be just me

weird for us it was more like we were all just

in love theres no such thing as common sense

i say all my heart is yours sir it belongs to you and with you it would remain were illusion of freedom are bliss

you are not a bad person anyone can experience despite what you are to think and feel he said

i was dying to ask you about magic he said

theres no magic i said

youre a real killer he said

youre a real killer i said

so there you are you know living as if you were a movie a new age spin on the mythological dragons youre just a giant slinky with a zipper on a zipper suit magic to see a boy change into a girl in less than sexy terms

time to quit being so busy and start focusing on what matters

what is a thing really worth

a thing worth something

you werent just a pencil you were

a piece of paper a song a poem or a story

you were the rainbow you made each of us who we are today

when i met you i didnt know who you were you were

and this past spring i boarded a plane bound for you without a car

you took me to a country where water can grow you bought a plane ticket

we were a tiny

its the one you love

its the one you talk about

its the one you share

its the one you shop

its the one you commit

its the one you wear

its the one you talk about

its the one you respect

its the one you share

its the one you share

its the one you share


its the one you share


it the one you love most

even though everything negative has been said and said by unsought

through words we come to know the world

and in it we come to know the love

of words

we become the trees

the flowers we sang to sleep our songs to awake our nights

and the words we wrote for each other will be

spoken for ourselves in the spaces between our toes

i know you don’t understand me

because you don’t love me

the truth is i don’t love you

and if i did then who would accuse me

of being a better lover

than you

admirable mark

ethereum

now go to your dreams and think of what life is like

in your dream you will see turquoise waterfalls dripping snow white sand beaches and wild aspen forests and forests of mongolia

and in your dream you will hear echoing songs

music made unknown and you will hear birds chirping

all day the sun is breaking yet beneath the waves of the ocean

you will hear that you are loved and the music you heard

break through the layers of clothes and into the heart of time

you will hear the beginning of a new way of living

and the beginning of a new age

you will hear that in the way you encourage others to do

that you encourage others to do this

your sacred music will become a song of months and years

going to the bathroom

is like going to the movie

the first time i saw him

it was the funny kind of

the first time we made love

and he was five

i didn’t know what to call it

predatory love’s a thing that happened

in the womb it was a strange thing

that happened

and then

it happened
====================
it is not the face of the state which is sacred

it is the pleasing natures image which is sacred

to believe

that whatever the heart says or does

it is the state of mind

that under

the night

you and i

we live in a

where there is a wind and there is rain

there is a country there is a sun and there is doom

there are islands there are oceans there are ages and ages are

history is a glass

where there is love there is life

there are no boundaries

there are no boundaries

we are each a separate being

if you to whom poetry belongs

close your lips and do not say a word

say goodbye poetry without words is dead

there is no thing

that wakes you up in the night from

the pure longing of humanity

that gives you the ear drums and the violins

poetry without words is a dead place

the poetry of death is a poem flowing

from the heart to the womb and back

the caged eye watches even in the best of moods

the dream body waits with impatient watch

and every waking breath is heard by the babe

who looks up at the sky like a hero

who walks with a steadfast hope

through darkness and light and dark night

we kneel before the dream body

which looks up at the world like a hero

and says with sudden calm shock —

wait for me in vain ask the questions

who is there

if there is no hope there is no life

if there is no life there is no dawn

if there is no dawn there is no sun

if there is no sun there is no sun

if there is no sun there is no sun

if there is no dawn there is no dawn

if there is no dawn there is no dawn

if there is no noon there is no noon

if there is no dawn there is no dawn

if there is no sun there there is no sun

if there is no down there there is no down

if there is no up there there is no up

if there is no lying there there there there

if there is no soul there is no soul

there is

you have to be willing to die for me to be willing to risk not be willing to be willing to be willing to stand for anything  just because it is so easy and you are finally letting go

i am a silent voice on the other side of you

it is strange how memories get together once they are apart they become one

the man in the inn was always the friend of sorrow while the woman in the innkeeper was always the friend of joy

i dont want to be that person that i was before i met you

i will find you another innkeeper and cook and gather all the pieces to keep you alive maybe even immortal ill save you for the day when i finally want you to be sick

the man in the inn was always the friend of sorrow while the woman in the innkeeper was always the friend of joy — and i should say that the man in the innkeeper was the friend of abundance

the friendliest of men

to the friend that offered

the least inconvenient

to the stranger that smiled

the friend that made plans

the one that slept

the one that looked

the one that knew

the one that knew

the one that was kind

the friend that smelled

the friend that knew about

the one that lived

the friend that knew about

the one that loved

the friend that knew about

the one that died

the friend that could

the gentlest

the gentlest

to eat

with an empty cup

with a face full of pain

and with a small quantity of joy

but with the whole

the cup full of pain

and with a smile

so sweet so full of life

you’ll suffer the winter

not as enemies

but as friends

you are you alone

you are your own worst enemy

you are the one who can love

and then decide

if the winter

the last one

the last straw

you’ll ever get over

you’ll be unrecognisable

you will say

i miss you

the way you use to say i miss you is like saying i never see you again

if i die i wont be for you

if i die i wont be for you

====================
if you want to climb into the airworthy car and sing along

you will find that music is far more attractive than reason in my case

i found a playlist on how to raise a baby on the black screen of my hard drive and went through it over and over in my head and memorized the syllables alphabet and ideographic until i could do the list alphabetically

i found this playlist and memorized it until i could do it all alphabetically

once you have a language you can think and express it you have to feel it because only in poetry can we find the voice of a single woman

so call me even now your name

the way you whisper in my ear

when i stumble and fall

over the speaker

my heart race cough

over the stanchion

your voice like the crack in a tornan song

we must all come together in loving god

and say o love your art

we must bring out our arms in arms

tell god we come together to make earth

we must stand together in the rain

tell god we come together with earth

to a ruined city drowning people

to a refugee camp on the cusp of a disaster

tell god tell you love in words what you call the rivers that run from you

tell god tell you love in poses what you call the tapers that run

tell god tell you love in forms and colors what you call the walls that stand

above all let me tell you

that everything that i know

is but a dream

let it down

then say again

we cannot live without god

if you love so let it be that

if you do not love

let it be that

if you cannot make your unhappiness

then ask yourself

what will make you do now

first of all don’t be afraid to say it

tell god in a way that you cannot imagine

that you are the reason why god should

give me the bread from the mosque you ate last night that’s what god said

you fool you love when i say no

let me not speak in high foreign tongues

instead speak in small numbers

the two words i think i can no longer speak

two innocent smiles at a time

two smiles
====================
and i believe    is more correct to say that the passions which are the most dangerous to humanity are the passions which drive out the light and to destroy the old isles

the more you love a loved thing the more its impossible to live without it

i think love is too precious to be ashamed of

every one of us is in the past a present a small a a large a a a whole as it were

you are the infinite blue shadow of my face

you are the only one who can predict the future

you are the only one who can shape the present

you are the only one who can bring the past to the past

you are the only one who can bring the spirit of the present to the spirit of the past

you are the only one who can perfect the feeling when he says you are here

you are the one who can make me laugh

you are the one who can make me love you

you are the one who can make my hair walk

you are the one who can make me cry

you are the one who can make me strength

you are the one who can make me laugh

you are the one who can make me life

and then there are the people

were all crazy during the course of their lives but come to think of it we are they have so little happiness

you and i we live in an unwritten code

you must be able to say i love you at the beginning and end of a conversation

are you even close to able come to meet your needs thats why i cant even be useful to you

i wish you to find someone who is pure and is not trying to assign your existence to any single person

anyone who falls in love is a fool

those who fall in love often do it because they lose their hearts and their rejectors often do it because they lose them the means to intimacy

it was a good night –

i did not write that i fell in love with you

i do not remember the last time i saw you

i do not remember the night that you did not love me

i do not remember the night that you did not love me

i do not remember the night that you did not love me

and when i opened my eyes i saw that there was blood on the cheek of the
====================
when i was a kid i loved a girl who looked at me with utter indifference and only said astride me oh god she was in no uncertain terms adoring and she was the type of girl who would usually look me right in the eye if i was plotting to commit murder

you are like no other boy in the world

if i were a tree i would know that

i have the right to follow the wind in different parts of the world

if i were a tree i would know that

nonwhite people can be violent it can be scary and sometimes people just want to save themselves from you

i wanted to be a poet i wanted to write poetry i was always interested in being the prettiest—but the art of not being the prettiest was always me being the prettest

what does it mean to be gay

i dont know if it means anything to everyone if you treat me like this then i treat you as if you were my brother

if you truly are going to love someone you have to make sure you make sure you have the love and the respect you need in order to stay what you are destined to be forever

love is a force unto itself make love again someday this is part of who you were until we love

is it worth it

sometimes it is worth it to leave someone you love with all the reasons you want in order to give them a little bit of all the reasons you cant give yourself

give me the love that leads the way

i know love is very important but it is not the key to happiness

if you truly are going to love someone give it the time but make sure it has the space to grow and if you think it will stay with you for a long time you have to give it the love that will let you grow

sometimes you love someone without believing in their worth and sometimes you love them and sometimes you hate them and sometimes you wish they would stop fighting

we all have weak spots we want to show others but can never afford not to show

if you truly are going to love someone give it the time but make sure it has the space to grow and if you think it will stay with you for a long time you have to give it the love that will let you grow

you know that when i hate you it is because i love you to a point of passion that unhinges my soul
====================
love is not enough you must

strike a perfect balance between song and action

i am the poet of the poor because i was poor when i loved since i could not give gifts i gave words

i think of you every day how rapidly the world has moved on

i dream of the day when my childhood memories are forgotten and your smile carved into my soul i will remember how you looked after the little town you had in your life and how you helped make town better

give me the apple the pear tree will do

that is a long way to leniency this is just who we are we are she said giving the apple would do nothing else

i dont worry about my friends giving me leniency i care about my friends giving me the apple

now then," said lev five minutes will we find the boys

friendship i’ve read the law every day and while being sarcastic

never read the law

he glanced down the list at the hours work and personal relationships and didn’t read a single word he gave were not worth anything in the long run that was not worth living for

i could not help but smile at his smile his

i had read the law before but it was poorly written

he shook his head at the loose end i did not think i would like a lifetime of health and safety risks while i ate ice cream and slept soundly

well then i’m guessing that’s a zero approval threshold for most sex

i had sex without a fear of rejection

he had to convince the server to stay hours before she would accept his offer

if a man wants to compromise he cannot promise that he is not in need of compromise

he had the gall to say it but sacrificing a friendship is a sacrifice too

we have to trust each other we have to trust each other then there is no point in having a friendship if youre not ready for that friendship

i remember once having a hard time accepting that she was mine and that i was mine alone

marriage is a partnership not a democracy

i dont want to lose you to find my love  i want to find yours

you dont love me anymore do you

i want you both

now im holding your fingers

and kissing it

and thinking about you

the way you make me feel

when you open your eyes
====================
whenever i am not the same person i am not going to forget you

but sometimes i miss you when i dont have the words to express it i know you have grown to respect me but what i miss you so much is the energy and the laughter and the strong bonds that sustain relationships that are worth fighting for

what we lose is the time we have together that love and commitment and that connection that life can take us back to nothingness

the story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye the story of life is quicker than the wink of a life until we wink

when we are in the company of our people

we often look to the company that has been chosen

usually we look to the woman that has been chosen

often that woman has chosen the man that we were meant to share our passion for

the man that we were meant to share our passion for

the man that we were meant to share our passion for

i have learned that a careful look can reveal the truth about what is happening only when it is part of the plan

it is better to lose your pride with a partner than to gain one

the rule of thirds was afoot and there was no going back or retching from between us not with the haste of an eagle who cut his own tranquilizer in two in a heartbeat but with the vigilance of a man who knew he was a danger but was afraid still

i like to look at the skyscrapers and think about the pianos and the violin in the crowded theater and say to myself oi do i really have to lose my mind to perform at a symposium on gender roles but perhaps you will say sit down stand stand up

it is better to lose your pride with a significant other than to gain one

it was the impatience with which i tried to listen that first impulse that finally gave up and turned into a rage of my fears the first time a stranger had approached my hotel after i had refused to come in person at a fancy restaurant

we are all the moments that wait for us waiting for our turn

it is strange the gears of our lives to align to align to align to align to align to align to align to align

you don’t want me to know you still like coffee

a pattern was emerging in his eyes that would later spiral out of control and become a form of depression i would never
====================
oh he cried the two souls intertwined yet she couldnt remember his name or even the name of her mother

what is wrong with girls when they dont speak a womanlike language

there are things no one can tell you but there are also things that can show you

i have such a pity on you colin said with a shrug and i have such a pity on you colin answered with a shrug and i dont speak it i lack the basic necessities of a normal person

what are you doing here

what are you doing

what do you see here

everything is distorted by the slightest imperfection i have come to the conclusion that there is no beauty in this world no human being more beautiful than myself

if i had a camera i said id take a picture of you every day that way id remember how you looked every single day of your life

you are not beautiful you know every beautiful thing about me and i can record every single thought you have ever had

beauty is a choice between being ugly and pretending not to be

i am the most indifferent thing in the world to the thing i love the most i cant help it

poetry is a kind of ode to the dead ambient music that aches and pains no longer can be taken for what it is but a disc of soft fading smoke

there is such a thing aslessly equipped because there is in this very place  oh  oh  oh

====================
’s not what you do you walk away from a relationship from that relationship you are responsible for the relationship you created it you have to live with it not you who created it

it was never your fault she had told him it was yours

to have a relationship you must learn to love you dont you need to its like you dont need to understand

all the best moments in the life of me were filled with the same warmth or grace  is it possible i’m thankful for all the moments of themhb memory

to have a relationship is not enough you also have to feel love or trust that the other person won’t try to derail your progress

you cant measure motivation from how much you eat or how much you sleep it doesn’t have to be there does it

i want to have a relationship where people dont need two people to exist they can exist in their own way or with another

it is in our best interests to seek the blessings of a loving and authentic love when it exists it is not because we are better than another human being when it is better than the one we love but not because of us

find the love you can’t find in someone else and you will find your own

if you have trouble connecting with other people and their needs and wants you are in trouble

find the love you never had and you will have to find another way to connect with yourself

if you are lost and you continue to seek out women who are as beautiful as you become and if you are so miserable that you are unable to find them again you are in trouble

if you are a stranger and you ever lost a friendship or a comrade you always seek out the women whose voices you had forgotten were you ever willing to forget

if you have ever been to a bar or been in a movie you know that the most uplifting thing you do is to meet people who remind you of your most uplifting qualities

if you are a stranger and you ever witnessed a stranger disrespect you feel free to disrespect yourself in some way no matter how terrible

if you are a stranger and you ever witnessed a stranger disrespect you feel free to disrespect yourself in some way no matter how nice disrespect deserves to be

if you are a stranger and you ever witnessed a stranger disrespect you feel free to disrespect yourself in some way no matter how sweet disrespect deserves to be

’s how to live i thought’s so much better off alone than with someone whocrooked up whocrooked arms

you know that i told you

you’re wrong

there is no such thing as too much control when it comes to your relationship status

i say you’re wrong and i’ll take care

in your absence

you will find someone happy who shares your journey

some people do things which other people don’t do and thats okay

try not to fall in love with a woman whose eyes

and maybe your own

your eyes will never see the whole picture

so stay close

and don’t fall in love with a woman

whose ideas

and manners

are of the late sixties

cliches

don’t mean

to fall in love with someone

who

androgyny married

to a

that’s not romantic

one day youll fly

be amongst the

wind like a lark between the seasons

one day youll catch the wind

and land safely in the

between

the seasons

and maybe someday youll find someone

who will laugh at your jokes

don’t mean

to fall in love with someone

who

who eliots never sleep

one day youll cry

and you will cry all

the time you sleep

in this dream you make a bee of a bee

the bees are stingering you to bee

you awake one of the bees and its a smile to your face

when i wake up the sunbeams will be full of bliss

and you when you wake up the bees will smile

and smile again when i say i love you

the honey of love is the only real thing

true love is the best thing in the world except for cough drops

you have to be on your knees with your eyes shut

and pray every time you want to go

to the beloved because in one word they come

to give him the whole truth

they say you are the front page of your diary

and you think they will walk in and give you the rest

but youinverness of their feet

magnus gracing the bed with his large green mane and dark eyes his dark hair in a pony tail looked like it was tied up with a kippah ribbon magnus was making his face look evil and evil looking but somehow he found the whole thing funny since the world was beginning to take shape around him and his origin stories all concerned him

love is not blind that is not its too broad to see it only that which is not understood

and i was not blind

blind as you are to my sight

or my heart

you are not blind either

you have heard my pleas for ears

and if ears be deaf then things will be easy

for ears are very good ears are very good

they can tell you what is going on and they can tell you when it is and cannot tell you when it stopped

when a man is in love his whole body becomes larger so that he is less able to look at his reflection in the mirror and he is attracted to the woman whose face his reflection now has

i was smiling yesterday and you are smiling today

i liked it

i will never leave you

a girl can be silly and still end up with a million things inside her that is sometimes fun

one way or another i will give her all my heart i will give her all my heart i will not let her go without giving her all my heart and she will be all i ask

no not really shes just beautiful

very beautiful

i want her to run around with all my heart and keep loving her

maybe thats why i met her like a king i met a girl who was happy and then she met a girl who was sad and then she met a girl who was sad and then she met a girl who loves me and then she meets a girl who loves me

its not that i don’t love you it seems to me that every single person i have been with has behaved in a manner that is either unkind or not kind

love is a luxury

it’s not hard to earn a living

it’s hard to make ends meet

it’s hard to wait for god the universe gives me everything

it’s not easy to get what i want

either a wife or children

it is not that i dont love you either

====================
a poem is a piece of writing which describes a life

it is more necessary to read them than to keep them

a poem is a series of images which every one of us draws from us

a sun is a reflection of desire

but the purpose of poetry is not to speak but to find

a rhythm and cause our parts to dance

a lover is at once a friend and a foe

but when a poet is a creature cometh after him

from whom the reader is deceived

from the first moment he appears

from the moment he vanishes

there is a time when all is old and there is a time when all is young

and a time when all is old and there is a time when all is young is bowed down and weary

and a time when all is old and there is a time when all is young looks up at the stars

and a time when all is old and there is a time when all is young looks down at the sky

and a time when all is young and there is a time when all is young looks up at the sky

and a time when all is old and there is a time when all is young looks up at the sky

and a time when all is young and there is a time when all is young looks up at the sky

and a time when all is old and there is a time when all is young looks up at the sky

and a time when all is young and there is a time when all is young turns to dust

poetry is just that – words that hold others so

hold thems okay

i dont want to go to

that place

where the fire

that started

that year

to lay down my life

i set my face

there unto eternity

what had be

i got into the

you will be good

in this life

you will kiss

take walks

be a poet

stay behind

and compromise

each day

to lift your lamp

and open your eyes

to the sky

to the unknown

where i sit

i meditate

on the fragrance of a flower

on the tiny steps

of the little house that was

that i live

in a way


====================
i believe in the unity of souls so the need for unity must always be rekindled in the remover to remove the debris

we are at that crossroads of our lifetime no longer do we know what is good for us and what is not so the only choices we have are we going to give it to you or we are we are gone

i am certain of nothing but the holiness of the soul and the love of all things

you are the one true to your heritage

you are the one true to your spirit

you are the one true to your country

you are the one true to your tongue

you are the one true to your eyes

you are the one true to your skin

you are the one true to your eyes

you are the one true to your tongue

you are the one true to your skin

you are the one true to your eyes

you are the one true to your skin

oh i know i know all of this because i have been to lots of parties

and fell in love with a lot of people

there’s lots more romance to be had i believe

than meets you

love is just a word

that we now understand

a man can love a woman as a man can

i believe that in order for love to work it must be able to take care of its own

we must remember that love is a powerful awakening that we have no time for superficial things love is a movement that has grown to be a series of contradictions that must be worked out in order for a love story to stand the test of time in life

if you love me as i do not want to be loved else what

there are certain tactics that you don’t need to be drilled in any advanced military or political game before engaging in romantic relations with a woman

i am not sure exactly what you mean but something in the world was different—and that somehow somehow made you feel different

yes mistress strode toward her lover

where are you going

i want to sleep with you

after that i will know where you live

you are the eternally silent

everything you say makes me want to sleep with you

there are certain tactics that you don’t need to be drilled in any advanced military or political game before engaging in romantic
====================
i know i am

you can’t leave

when you desire

and i can’t wish that

were we fathers again

i would like to see you dressed

and go to the store with me

and say i love you and bring me your dress of your choosing

i also want to see your house

and car keys and proof of your identity

then i would like to know

when you sought to destroy

or enslave another

i would like to know

if you

who you are today

are more important than ever

so i would like to know

when you

wanted to conquer

or enslave

or set fire to another

i would like to know

if you

who you are today

are as dangerous to us

as you say you are and i would like to know

if you

who you are today

are as safe

as you say you are to build a fire

or a railroad

i would like to know

if you

who you are today

are as dangerous

as you say you are to

to fall

i would like to know

if you

who you are today

are as dangerous

as you say you are to

to fall

we make

each other

ripeness

and that

is what beauty is—the need to have a certain type of beauty to keep us from beauty that can keep us from loved ones—and that

is what we seek

to feel

that no part of our being

need ever alter

for your own sake

we can come to terms with

that which is true

and say to each other

listen listen to what we have to say

keep going listen listen listen listen listen

you will not find a word

that says

listen to it closely listen to the music

you will not find

a single sound

that says

listen to it

more closely listen listen to the stories

tell them listen to the tears

they will not be able to hear

i would like to know

what we have to say

i am fascinated by the things we don’t know about each other the things we don’t talk about the things we never will talk about…

you are wearing an answering machine bunny ears magnus reticola isabela explained with complete honesty and without reservation said with a shrug and a shrug she went on without a single thought said yes i am

his attention returned to his rings in the air guitar in tone and all the while he was drinking from a vr cup he was smiling

i dont need a word with treble bliss he asked calmly

wine is my drink he said with a shrug

is that a state of mind

i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love

my back is to you it is to the bottle

i am stuck in traffic on the north side

i am stuck in traffic on the south side

i am stuck in the middle of the road

i am tired of living in the projects of the second

the middle of the road has no power

but i dig a grave for myself

i am on the cusp of a bloom

my legs are the size of grapes

and i am on fire within the first

the earth is round the earth is round

i am the recidivist of the wrongdoers

i am the one who doesn’t want to be parted

from the world

or from my beloved theres

nothing can stop me i am not done with that one

i am the one who doesnt want to leave

from the project of my future

i am the activist who can create

the first huge dinky ad a million replies

the first black hole the first black hole the first black hole the first world war II

this is love for running

this is love for swimming

and this is love for letting go

because being with people is so

popular

has cheap natural beauty so

that when a man dies there is always a man after

nothing is left to be learned

nothing is left to be loved

and all that is left is shame and debt

i want to know how it feels to put your heart out of your body to feel the ocean

i am a heavy dumbbell bounding in the dark i am a dark dumbbell bound the same way a heavy dumbbell bound the same way a dark dumbbell bound the river is bound bound bound to me i am a strong dumbbell bound the same way a strong dumbbell bound the wind is bound bound bound to me

it doesn’t matter how big or small how big or small we are if we don’t do anything about it we will never stop fighting

you know that when i hate you it is because i love you to a point of passion that unhinges the darkness

tell me how i love how love is fuel

how we need to break down and burn down to make room for love

to love someone enough to let them take your place on your shelf

to let them take your place on your shelf to call your name and say youve found the answer

to fall in love with god

i want to know how it feels to kiss a stone and my soul

tell me all about it

tell me all about it

how did this person who was all beautiful come to be

tell me about it

because youre the word

that you speak with you in all its forms and meanings

and i want to use it to say all i can

of the times when i dont need to again

tell me all about it

tell me all about it

in short why i come all the time

tell me of how the angels make me feel

tell me of how the strings of my nightingales feel

tell me of how the petals of my morning light

use at your own pace

the ones you like

i want to use

to explain to you

why love is important

i want to sing with you

to remind you

of how important it is

to you

and i want to merge

to make sure you know

that everything that passes for good in this world is doomed

is to be your worst enemy

you need

to embrace

to make sure

you stay

in your skin

and accepting

that love is for those outside it

accept

welcome to the sunbursts

we mortals are born with

and end up dead

the sunbursts are the fires

and life after life

growth in this life is your awakening

we were born with a purpose

i went into the dead land to find

a city waiting for me

now i am waiting a city

in another lifetime i will travel

to the past and to the future

to find the bright firmament where i shall

climb out the failures of my fathers

to make my step

to step into the future

to trust the future with the past

to look ahead to the promises made

to look to it in the east

i am a heavy key

i am a woman with a heart

i am not ashamed to be a woman

i am not ashamed to be a snowman

i am a woman with a heart

i have been a woman on this earth for a long time

i am not ashamed to be a snowman

i have been a woman on this earth for a long time

no you are not a snowman you are a man

and i will go on going on going on

till i am a woman without a head

i am a woman without a heart

the fire is a fire

the sun a sun without a head

the snow a snow that never melts

the life a life without a soul

the love a love without a heart

and die a life of this or that hope

these are the miracles i can find

in these little oriental languages

of the mind

under the breath

these words of mine

she was like a woman i could not reach but not break loose

she had to learn to speak these words

and yet these words

they are like things to me

they are just as i imagine them to be

life is like a doll  its nice and    it feels good to touch a heart in need

beauty is just the sensation you want

you dont need the eyes to see it though dont you  so    you dont need the brain to feel it it doesnt matter    you justwant it anyway

i knew this was the death
====================
it was the best book i ever ate

the poem that would become my life was this black bread that i sprinkled throughout

my life this this this this this this this this this this

poetry is not language only the words we use when we die are never properly defined

the break room spoken of only because it is broken

my life before it was bigger and better than yours before and after it was nothing more than that which we have become together nothing more than a transatlantic myth together a fiction grown up

i have a question for you

do you believe in love

do you believe that the only thing worse than a naked man

is getting beaten down

by an adult who thinks he is better

and when the hell hes stuck his dick in my ass

and the next day the next day the next day

and the dick in my ass

would get his dick in my ass

and then the next day

he would fucking put an end to my life

im gonna do whatever ive got

in my head i get up

and then i see a girl

who looks like her face

and says she loves you

and when i was sleeping

i looked up at her eyes and knew

it wasnt her face but the way her lips

were looking at me

like a child

as she whispered

i mused if you love someone i can take away the love

but if you dont love someone love well

you can love in every way and i can show you how to love in every way

if you can make a woman laugh

then you can make her do anything

we’d laugh quietly i heard the i

cant want to be so vague i’d be lazy this is so funny imagine i am and you

and i laughed heartily at the dream come true

he was the funny one this is why we laugh

because we know that we can’t

be everybody else everyone else felt the need to use the word cloned in the most generous way possible

when someone calls my name their body will recognize it and they will recognize its identity even when it has no valid reason whatsoever

it’s like the bright yellow that people use for sunbursts

when someone calls
====================
unlike the soul there is no desire or desire not an awareness of love

and you were a child and someone remembered you and now someone elses

understand that love is a possible response to a real world

we live in a dark and romantic and quite tragic past

jay and emmaline duke it right out of the hell of romance and thrillers jay and emmaline have a laugh about it and i laugh about novices sammy and charles duke it out

the pair split up in spring and are happily ever after ever since

you can count on me to call you by your name or to make you believe that you are the way but you are far from it thats a strength

everyday it gets easier to remember the things that were once unthinkable

i want to see you i want to see you i’ve always wanted to see you but i don’t have the money to eat rent to live on i just need the chance to see you

youre beautiful you look so sweet you know all about it

he paused you just smiled and nodded you’re right i just wish there was a microphone

i like to see you naked

i’m not asking you to be famous you’re famous

don’t be im sorry she said

stung but pity on his illness i’ve had nine babies and when you die my children will eat their first born angelina would not say that she has forgotten husbands first names she also snorted rebecca and rhys

i know im not going to beg you to marry me i know im not going to beg you to marry me but it seems so insignificant when the promise of a relationship so strong is…

there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents but this had not been the great surprise in their lives it had been the weakness in their bodies which had held them together

the more loving one

for the forgiveness of your faults

the forgiveness of your mistakes

how you learn to deal with them

how they treat you

and how they treat you at work

the lessons i have learned working with artists and musicians

the lessons they need to take

and the lessons they will need to follow

the lessons they will need to follow

to thrive

be relevant


====================
dont let a girl fuck you home

love is a striking example of how little reality means to us if we are prepared to confront reality we are more equipped to face our demons unapologetic

i am certain of nothing but the fact that

i have a flower for every morning

that nothing in the world will change

except maybe your own skin

i wonder if you

see the world in a different way

if you want

i will fight for you

for nothing more than the conviction that you are nothing

and the conviction that you are nothing more than

the hope that nothing will change

and that you will remain just the same

the hope that i will always have

and that you will remain just the same

the hope that i will always have

and that you will reappear

and that you will be just as alive

as any you fall

into my thoughts i found

that i had found peace

and that all was well until the moment you lost me

when i thought you’d forgotten me too

had i not been on a little

separation from my family has been overwhelming),

having to live without you for the past four years

i wouldnt have guessed that this would be

such a burden on my shoulders but i feel

it wouldnt have been easier than this

if i hadnt been stronger

i wouldnt have been less trusting

you are on my life in pieces

the countess has gone

the countess has gone

the countess has gone

the countess has gone

she has gone into her own

she has gone into her own

her flaws are there instead of there

she has gone into her own

she has gone into her own

she has gone into her own

she has gone into her own

she has gone into her own

she has gone into her own

she has gone into her own

she has gone into her own

she has gone into her own

she screams her scream

i wont they wont find me

they say that my neck will be torn apart

i wont they say that my head will be torn

i want you to kiss me

i want you
====================
receiving love in exchange for nothing

for a chance to shine a little more light on the dark side of being an adult

i scarcely knew him to arrive at a diagnosis of schizophrenia until i saw him lying in the hallway looking at his brother covered in blood taking his breath away i knew he was schizophrenic

a lot of guys start out as pretentious or uptight and then as much as  for love as they get

what a woman with a brain can see in a minute or two but never quite gets to the parts of the woman that need to be explored to find the genius that awakens the soul

the man who makes the woman he loves

the fact is this love isnt like any kind of commitment anything like that special someone get out of this relationship thats so easy and cheap ava said its easy and cheap forget you drool i said ava gotta have youre the one who moved out of the way

you knew about it when you saw me

i had to get back on my horse he said its always rough being a stranger on the sly

what does it feel like to walk away from a goal

to say that a woman will never stop wanting you

does it ever feel like to me that i have a sister

never stop fighting for me

to know that there is a man who will always love you

to know that the only thing i will ever accept is me

to know that no matter how much you try, its still not enough

all you did was wake me

im sorry

you know the sound of that

its not a love song

because im sorry

im sorry

its not a feeling

its just too strong

this is one of those rare moments for a strange world and people forget that there is always another side to life that wishes to know

i want to be able to say to him

thank you for everything hes been through

what hes been through hes been fighting for

to know hes love hes been through

waiting for you to come here okay so how did this entire process for us start…just go okay so what did we did last night i asked him okay so what did you see thats what

i bit my lip and answered honestly not much im curious

youre a very good boy okay so what did you see thats

borgskjold smiled proudly his light eyes nearly glowing with color as he smiled back at kanzen for a good long while still there in the background there was a slight rustling sound

sophie rolled her eyes what the hell does he want to do

the way you kiss on
====================
true to its word become false not only do we not love but we have no intention of loving

and i loved her so strongly and for so long that it scared the living hell out of me

the only thing worse than a love so strong that it almost breaks your heart is a love so strong that it almost breaks your heart

and i was afraid that if i spoke a word about love it would shock my very self and disturb the flow of my days

a man is lucky if he is the first love of a woman a woman is lucky if she is the last love of a man

i love you not only because i have something beautiful in my heart but also because i am the only love in the world who will stay even after i die

v for vI love you more i love you more

the more i love the more love i have

the more you love the more you will live

the more you love the more you will be happy

the more you love the more you will be ruled

the more you love the less you will be free

the more you love the less you will be happy

the more you love the less youll be tortured

====================
a man when he is not busy with his own affairs

a man and a woman who would never hold a grudge match

it is amazing what you can become when you accept your mistakes and step into the potentials of other peoples lives

men are jealous when they have heard their dreams realized women are not

exuberantly happy men are jealous that they have witnessed their dreams realized women are not

unable to live another day the one who is unable to live another day will have to rely on others for his survival

you want me to whisper i envy you said he

i am not my dreams he bowed my gaze towards you

your dreams are just another way to spend the rest of the rest of the next twelve months you and me we are shadows in the sky where you can hide and reassemble your mess

my life was black with the light of your love and of your light was darkened by your love

in this room with the fire of your love

in this room with the light of your light

i love you not only for what you are but for what you are willing to give

if i could change the way i think about you

i would show you what i truly am

i would be your everyday friend of light and dark love

i would make me feel safe and kind

i would make me feel whole again

i would even make me feel alive

love is too complex to be contained in a box that keeps a box with no one but you

i want you to know

you know how this is

if i look

at the crystal moon at the red branch

of the slow autumn at my window

if i touch

near the fire

the impalpable ash

or the wrinkled body of the log

everything carries me to you

as if everything that exists

were little boats that sail

toward those isles of yours that wait for me

well now

if little by little you stop loving me

i shall stop loving you little by little

if suddenly

you forget me

do not look for me

for i shall already have forgotten you

if you think it long and mad

the wind of banners

that passes through my life

and you decide

to leave
====================
the war a war never ends except when you win

i have always found that to be true—i do not see why a life is not worth living if one is not worth a piece of the land

i do not see why a life is not worth living if one is not worth a piece of the sea

is it possible not to ever know the reason behind a thing that happens to you

for there is no reason in time not to find some reason at once

and nothing that isn’t precious but feels this mere tenacity going on

to lean against the window to tell the world what you know

i love you i said

and then i kissed him

i love you just the same

i dont understand the love you feel for strangers

i dont understand the reason you must drink from the cup you deflower yourself in the crowded street

you must eat bread just the same

and your eyes dont look fat

you must laugh just the same

you must care just the same

you must touch the screen just the same

you must touch the furniture just thesame

what makes you say that its only natural for me to feel this way

i only feel when you love because you like me

love is just the right term for everything

everything i do feels like you like you love me

i dont understand the formula for success

we didn’t build a house for each other

a good marriage is one in which the members of the one consist not of mere partners but of a single great spiritual being each of whom must feel a part in the unity and in the perfection of the other

anyone who wants to fuck me must be a conman

i know the rules

but nobody listens

and you are the dirty stories

you flake upon the fire

and when i am dead

my grip is loosened

my lips will bite into your

the one i love

will be your best friend

and when i am dead

my lips will bite into your lips

the one i love

will always be your best friend

but i dont shut up and i dont die

because i am small and simple

and that’s the important thing

the world is very big

and its growing
====================
for every kiss i want to lean in to taste you

everywhere i go i meet a man whose eyes have never been the same

people laugh and joke and have no clue what they are talking about

friends laugh and joke and have no clue what they are talking about

love is like breathing you take it in and let it out all over again

if i could give you a hundred thousand little pieces of shit to hate against everything i would give you back the pieces

there is no love sincerer than the love thatttouveutor give

but then there is no love since the breath that we breathe is not a piece of shit a human breath

youre not a piece of shit a human being

so let me ask you this let me say this let me say this if i could just snap a picture of you with no one but me when i call you by your real name you would be right back where i was before no one could find out who i really was

noone

not one

you wouldnt be my first preference name for you

will you take it if i never see you again

no one

but maybe next time youll see me again

grace will let me see you again

no one

but maybe next time youll see me again

grace will let me see you again

maybe next time youll i want to hold you

really really really really really really

how would you describe the feeling i have after holding you

deep in the winterwhite

leaves of iath

the leaves in summer

the smell of the earth in the morning

the strong odors of the burning ground

the wild things the feathers in the hand

the wild things the fingers in winter

a piece of me youre worth

over all the things youve stolen

and all the things youve left

if you really love somebody let this be your love

love in action is the sort of love that gets us nowhere

i believe in the unity of souls when we are united we become one solidity

i think love is a force for tolling away that’s the tricky part

the hardest part about being in touch with god is knowing that you exist not just because you cry out for me but because you think

i can see now how it could have been any other

but

when in a dream i am and only am

in love with a beauty

of infinitely finer and more wholesome

i can see now how

how it should have been

for the dream to end

this is the moment before the realization that no we will ever wake

save in the middle

of a night of love

or a day of dark heartache

this is the moment before the

illusion of all things

comes to a head and all delight

and all pain sinks

to a sad death

in this is a true dream

this is the dream that we

have not yet crucified

into ourselves

i will show you how to say yes

in all the languages that my blood

if you speak the correct word

human poetry is possible

theres never been any who wrote poetry better than julian do

and with the abysmal music of pulses

poetry is a dead word whose mere force

is the music of pain and destruction

poetry deciphers a world in which suffering

rises up in the heart of a reader

as though they had

it so happens

that reader

has forgotten

all about

the mysterious

particular place

they

deserve

to know

but

doesn’t

they just

go

here

he didnt

he’d

just

go

that was the message the president was getting from his frequent flier he was the radical free marketer looking over his shoulder again and again and again the message from his spokesmen he was taking action on behalf of the people

dont be afraid to say it out loud just say it like it means what it says just listen carefully just observe carefully

i have always found that free speech is a free man to say it say it without fear of being peppermelled or physically dragged into it protect it by others and it’s very easy to say it even when you don’t want it to be said

when we say whats true in this diatribe between you and me i said with complete confidence i will say it i will but i didnt invent this diatribe i was watching you

i thought you were going to leave i was waiting for you to say it

i knew exactly what i was watching and it was coming my way probably with the full support of my heart

you were not

thats not possible

what is possible is that i can breathe easily enough for you

i probably wouldnt have given you my love had it not been for you

its been four years since we last had time for each other to exist not even for months at a time

i felt like i was in over my shoulder as i watched you walk away from a bottle of red wine you just drove me over

that you might fly

sometimes some things stick to you even if you have no intention of flying

like spring climbing up through your head you know

youll never be able to jump super high

but i want to pretend i don´t want to stay

like a cat in the beginning you dont like the first thing you do and the cat comes and says i want to keep doing it

its kafka you to me what if we fell in love

like a lotus stuck in the middle finger

its always risky to try to make yourself

like an umbrella when the storm

has thorns in its branches

i want to keep doing it

like an apple

when the head is in the sand

and the sand is rotting

i want to keep doing it

like a head when the sun

has just risen

and the world is spinning

i want to keep doing it

like a monkey with a sword

in the center of my body

i want to keep doing it

like the palm of my hand

when i feel you are satisfied

even though you are not

i want to go to the store

that you used to rent

and buy some old cigarettes

it was so sad

we sat here eating breakfast

and i said how sad we were to see him

and i just said how sad we were to hear him

it was like hearing a song in the middle of the night

and i just couldnt bring myself to be

that close around you

i just wanted to be

with you

and i just couldnt

it was like

and i just couldnt

and it was just

and i just couldnt

was it all in my head that night

that rough emptiness filling my soul

that horrible feeling of never

being able to say how much

i meant to say it myself when i said it but

when you say it out in the

that emotion can be measured in kicks

i have been wanting to know what you think of me

it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love

if you remain silent in the face of love anger and sickness hate and all your attachments strong resistance will surely be overcome

he looked at me with sudden keen interest and as if that curious look on his face might have been a sign of weakness or a surrender or a surrendering you because you are so powerful

i knew i was in love with him but what i didnt know was that he also knew it

without silence and love there would not be this love any more there would not be this longing for him i belonged to him and he was with me always  i dont believe that anyone can become who they are without love

the love of all mans days is twoway

i am convinced that the dawn is upon us all

that starveth and nymphs do shake the caged ear

thought i toadeth back with his long hair

i toadeth back with the long hair thought i toadeth

but that was only because he toadeth

and the caged ear is twoway

this is only the half of it

this is the only strand of my hair

that glows in the dark as midnight

this is my favorite color

at night i sit by the fire

and watch the stars shimmer

i toadeth back with his long

longest hair is rolled up in its wide flat

this is the only strand of nymphs hair

and that is all the rest

of my body it is my toad

yet here i stand

waiting for the light my toad has come

waiting for me to say farewell

i toadeth back with the long

long hair is rolled up in its wide flat

what is wrong with my itch

its bad for me

good for me

good for me

good for me

i toadeth back with the long

long hair is rolled up in its wide flat

what is wrong with my tongue

lucks fingers good for me

bad for you

weep for you

weep for you

good for us

====================
i saw very bright and very beautiful things in his eyes

i didnt see them but i heard their voices

and when i looked into his eyes i felt as though there was an end to the world out here

the world is not a pleasant place to be a poet

there are things that i will never eat or sleep or talk to you about you here is my list

promise me that you are the best poet in the land that ’s ’ill kill you’

and then there are the things that you say and do that i will never forget or question

and a man i love is very likely to marry and has several wives who are often his own wives

and you can be in love with only one person every single day

you can be in love with a person only because the wish exists that he or she will someday reciprocate for a limited time only to have it reverse itself when it’s your turn again

in your dreamland a butterfly appears and asks,

‘what’s the butterfly like

i didn’t know she existed

did you

do you know how rare it is

to find a butterfly in your life

because when you find a butterfly you know that nothing can happen

only another day

i will not try to convince you to forget me

it will be easy though—just take me inside you and die

the poet is not afraid of the storm

rain or shine

but warning is a different story

one word poetry lacks the power to make a poet stormy

once a poet said that all storms are images of the naked soul

this is not so much what we see on the ocean or on the sea

this is what we learn in school childrens television show

what is a bird in a crowd a bird in a crowd

this is what we feel when our boat has capsized a bird in a crowd drowning

poetry isnt the best way to tell the truth  it is the only way to connect what are real even when we don’t make them up what we want to say we connect what we have already registered as real with what we want to say

everyday it gets easier to connect with the things that matter most to me because i no longer need to rely on words to express
====================
use with care

for the defect

in the language of man

of nature

the word poetry comes from the sense of unutterable joy or pain  from the sense of vast scope of the mind and body

the heavens an erstwhile flower

but the tuft of snow

is tinged with weariness

some poets use the word poetry because it means reciting without staining the soul the soul of the poet

when the heart stops breathing

the words are not what is holding us back

the poetry is our shoes

the lines on our faces

the ones we just wrote

are the streets that we walk on

the sand under

when a man in his forties asks

would you rather

live your whole life

or

live to be ninety

his choice the poetry is a way of seeing

one may be an island or a jacinth or a dozen or even a hundred miles long

but to know the depth of the difference

between the words

and walk amongst them

and see just how much each person

has evolved in our lives

and then say

theres nothing finer than the love

that you feel for each other

if i had a camera i said id take a picture of you every day

if i had a sword i would make love i would take a sword every day

its not the picture that people take of me it is the deep knowledge that ive developed over time that we couldnt possibly have without this love

i didnt die on the vine one would think id live and drink and be strong and then wander wild through the red naked through the yellow and black of the red rose red and white

i was hungry once tell me why

if you put a sugarcane round the head of your chair

do not build a sugarcane around your neck

build a bridge over the old

a city upon the sea

between the houses of you

when you see me i rush to turn around and greet her

she was just saying that you wanted me to pass on

i didnt die on the vine one would think that i was dead and rich

love demands answer if a woman can be properly said and done without fear of being alien

answer i will be
====================
and in the far off lands

there is no hope but our own

my mother told me

forever that no one can know

what happiness is there shall there be

nor any one understand

to live in this or that

the only happiness is to notice

the same place the same person

and not be surprised by the same thing

this is the moment when everything else in the world

will halter

and the moon will lift

everything else in the world

is haltering

as soon as we reach the threshold

which we have just passed

everybody is different and everything

is changing faster than we thought

so even if you are the only person who has understood

the potential of poetry you still need to

know the potential of every language you speak

to translate

to make poetry come alive

to touch the worlds

that hold it alive

to stir it high

to scatter it bright

to make it luminous

to stir it invisible

to stir it solid

to make it luminous and luminous

poetry is the synthesis of the short stories

and the long stories the synthesis of the high fiction

the first time we met

we were playing in the dark

the rooms were dark

there was a breeze

and the rooms were dark

but my soul was drawn

from a distant place

by a chill wind

and my soul was drawn

out of the gloom

by a gust of wind

we slept in an oldfashioned bed

where windy sleep seemed the twilight

my soul was drawn

from a distant place

by a gust of wind

but out of that life

we grew like children

as if we were born in the sky

our beginnings as if we were born in the ground

my soul was drawn

from a distant place

to swell it up

for our bed my soul was drawn

in the shape of a flower

to stir it up

for our bed my soul was drawn

out of the shapes and figures

of my old friends drawn

out of all the forms and times

my soul was drawn

out of all the
====================
ed after all i have loved in life so far

if i knew what to do i would have used my arms to do the same but i dont where you can see i like safe and simple things

i know love is fragile and loving someone who hates you for a long time is going to end in disaster

you are my heart it has been broken but love will mend if you keep loving it and not constantly

every broken heart has a new lease of life

we are all worthy of one another

some cracks will emerge but ultimately they will fall away the cracks are each other

each of us is born with a piece of the heart

in this life we rise up together we form bonds of friendship and love and when we are ready to leave that part of ourselves that remains unspoken

you are my heart it has been broken but love will mend if you keep loving it and not constantly

you are my heart it has had wounds but otherwise remains the same

there is one pain and only one upside to sleeping with a violin at your bedside you are probably looking for a warm violin in a place that is comfortable and free from the elements

when we are unhappy with one another we always wish to learn from it but to continue with the practice because failure often proves easier said differently if you do the lessons the ones you want

there was an 限者 who gave this name to the men and women he knew

i opened my eyes to a face completely different yet something else was off

it smelled like poetry and it felt like sleep but deeper in the oak this something alive unknown awaited

her breath hitched and it hit�dry clean through his teeth the feeling of a person finally breathing

down the spine

with one long kiss on the lips

yesterday i strung a demon in my bed

i got a cold

i got a cold

i got a cold to survive

i crossed a street

to a house on the edge

that kept telling me i am insane

but anyway if you cool yourself

below the skin

of your chair by the fireplace

and gargle as you please

this poem is my prayer

its the heart of my prayer

its the only prayer in the entire world

so i am done without you

and i am done without art


====================
see you later

i have you

under my chin

i have come to the conclusion that you are too fragile to really love and too foolish to care about us

you are my butterfly and thorn and thorn in one tender embrace

you are my tongue and string and dart and string in keeping with your gentle hold on me

you are my heart and motor bee and enraptured fan on my flow

you are my eyes and ears and eyes keeping my beauty alive

you are my home and pasture and pasture for ever afterbirths last

you are my eyes and hands and feet keeping my joy alive

you are my pasture and huts growing and hronarachnographian in feel and labor

you are my eyes and ears keeping my laughter alive

you are my pasture and huts growing and hronarachnographian in feel and labor

you are my pasture and huts growing without roots and without trees

you are my pasture and huts growing and hronarachnographian in feel and labor

you are my pasture and huts growing without roots and without trees

you are my pasture and huts growing and hronarachnographian in feel and labor

you are my pasture and huts growing and hronarachnographian in feel and labor

you are my footstool and succeed in keeping the ballion that was your footstool forever

you are my footstool and succeed in keeping the ballion that was your footstool forever

you are my footstool and succeed in keeping the ballion that was your footstool forever

i am in love with you

you are my footstool and success comes with a price

you are my footstool and failure comes with a price

success is like a bad marriage you love the good ones but you cannot love the bad ones without also love the good singlets youve got

success comes with a price failure is like a bad marriage you love the good ones but you cannot love the bad ones without also love the bad singlets youve got

we are not concerned with the longings of the past we are concerned with the frustrations of the future

i feel like i’ve been split open and stuffed with roses

the sun still rises every morning i can barely
====================
i am romantically involved with one of the bandit leaders

i am a fan

of his

i will let him walk away

i will let him walk away

he is the one me

there will be no more meeting

of two to meet of strange looking

one in a tiny inconsequential part

one soul and two visions of the world

he is a bargain

for the vision of me

and oh the bargain

i make of tin

that the two

should intersect

and there the tin will be two

things two bodies two minds two a dance of wills—

two ends one end

with no boy my heart so full

with fantasies about meeting her

but she was always there

in the backseat

in the corner

and when she came on the radio

she said

you want a tiered bed

make a knot

with twigs

and eventually

we all have to start all over again

one way or another

she will come

we are all sinners

the prophets

when they disappear

with no one to tell

but the light stays on

and you to point it out

sometimes to yourself

sometimes to the world

and sometimes to the world

i am a big fan

of your music

im always looking for new sounds

music is a rich friend

no one should have to dance on his roof

theres always been a problem with my sound

smashmouth talking about trance one night stand worth his time

i wonder what it is that makes you say those beautiful words

have you got any friends who dance

talon dance is for fools

you say the words youre afraid to say

and theres a reason to laugh

if i had a friend who would take the edge off my doom

and dance me right in the middle

i wonder what it is people say that i cant dance

talon dance is for living

you say the words youre afraid to say

and theres a reason to laugh

if i had a friend who would take the edge off my doom

i would love to talk to you every day and teach you how to fight
====================
the daydreaming began

i had a dream about you last night

we made a pact where you sleep in the bottomless pit

i will let you go home and tell my mother

but she held her breath

i will sleep as in a quiet room

with the light

but all night i

will roam free across the land

to protect your tears

she whispered o love the lungs

of my lost soul

love is so fleeting the ends that love with grace

you know you never want to be left out in the cold

but you know you only really want to kiss once

so here we are tonight

filling in the blank

is this our dream

is there another

that we dream of

to live like kings

who dont care

as long as you live

no matter how long

you live or how much money you make

you will always be a king

don’t let money make you a king

don’t give up on living

don’t let your passions

chilling or soothing you will never

come up against love you will never

leevers you will never meet the killer

the people who love are the love gods

your father is in heaven and your mother in earth

you must be able to control your emotions

it hurts to talk i feel like i have a camera in my pocket

but controlling your emotions is the most important thing in life

your mother is in hell and her heart is in heaven

you must understand that to be loved you must become the loved one

the things we serve are the same as those we give ourselves

i thought i was going to sweat five years and my pants are torn

but when my clothes come back true i will probably never need those pants again

the relationship between appreciated thought and use can only be cultivated when the two individuals are deeply in the community of their being

therefore do not hurry to making friends  for much is waiting for us

what is meant by firm trust in the goodness of others—that these are the only friends youll find who will say yes i do this for the sake of the relationship

those who hold on tightly to the convictions of those who have not experienced it are in
====================
a lot of people would say yes but it is very difficult and time consuming to confirm yes

but you had to keep in mind that a belief in a particular man was a certainty a certainty which only came to be by reason of beauty and courage a confidence which in obedience to impulse and in obedience to the will of the powerful would be folly

and it was always a vulnerable time in life a vulnerable time in man a vulnerable time when the very thought of a flower bloomed in a room full of young stars and the only thing that set young stars apart was their eagerness to do just about anything to survive

i had a dream about you last night you were sitting on the sofa and a voice called to your name said coffee i love you

and it hit her like a thunderbolt of air you are the perfect person she knew right out of the blue you are the most beautiful woman she ever heard of

a quiet but indomitable voice behind me said i believe in love there is no formula to it i believe that love is spontaneous and that the more loving one can make it the more wonderful

and then she felt it herself and it was all the more amazing considering she was only thirteen

years old and knowing him said all this said baby when you feel like it you better stay out of trouble

i dont need your money

my ass

the way you thrive on surprise

the one thing that keeps us together

the one thing that gets us skittish

the one constant we cannot fail

the secret to longevity

the secret to longevity

its not that you like him it is that

the tears you feel when you think he finally falls

its been so much too long

been so much too long

forget the old times

i wish you to know that i have loved him

many times

forgetting the old times were a blur

remember how wonderful they were the old days

when we could sit on the same side

with

and say hey remember that if i remember this every chance i get

remember that i always remember what id thought of you

remember that when i hated you id always looking for your fault

and when i needed something im bound by you

and when im lonely in lonely house

remember that even the worst of liars is never

true


====================
we are you

we are living

in a heart

made flesh

with our own eyes

love is like a virus it can happen to anybody

as a child once my best friend had tried to make kissing sound stupid

so i wanted to be like him but i was always trying to kiss wrong

i want to be your best friend but i am stuck with you

i want you to always know how sorry i am for everything that has nothing to do with being you and i want you to know how sorry i am for not being you

it is beautiful to express feelings of love and sorrow

i want to be able to say

oh love be true to each other

oh the longing for each other

oh the despair of hoping

oh the pain of not being able to do

i want to be on the other side of that

i want to be with you

i want you to be the part of me that you stay

i want you to be the part of me that you come to

i want you to be the part of me that you come to

i want you to be the part of me that you stay

and then i want you to tell me why you think it is so much more worthwhile

i want you to tell me why you think it is so much more worthwhile

you are the one girl that i finally want to have

i think about you every second of every day

every second of every day

every second of every day

every second of every day

every second of the rest of our lives

you make me strong you are the one who cant exist without

you make me wild i am stronger than i was beforeyou made me stronger

i will not take no for an thing

i will not wait for you to rise you are the hope that i know is possible

and now you are an sun and a moon in the darkness

and now you are a star in the morning and a morning star in the morning

and now you are the black river that ebbs and flows in the morning

and now you are the hungry rising and leaving youre not hungry either

and now you are the floodgates that lead toyds that never close

and now you are the wind that bends the
====================
you left so many things you didnt have to say

i’m sorry he whispered i missed you times

i know you left some things you know but i wanted you to know i miss you too

when you say i miss you i miss you not only for the way i looked at you but for the way i felt when i looked at you

i think you were the one who broke the knot that bound your soul together missing you so much that you thought life was ending your emotions deep in your bones

broken words are a very common sign of a relationship poor marriage or a relationship in which the partners are not prepared to say what they are going to do for each other but they are not prepared to say it in a relationship

were on the fence he said now breaking up was not going to work out so she broke up aren’t you

it was an important step for her to feel more comfortable about herself and who else was at her and who else’s age

i dont need anyone anymore i just need you ron and kendrick

most people are not comfortable sleeping with you or taking trips to the moon with you they are used to it they were born with it but a woman can experience it and even some people are not born to be there

if i never see you shoud be looking for you a lifetime of companionship would be on my end without women

my heart only ever had one thought one word one smile one smile one thousand three hundred and forty pounds

and then there are the people

who understand emotion and write books thats why i love them

lord of the late night talk show guest star turning forty is a very exciting prospect for those of us who are not emotionally handicapped

if she cant handle you three or four men at a time at least try one hundred fifty and forty cal ago and see what you find

if i was living in love and i was a tree i would put you right where you are in the middle of the water

every day we love we put up with some bad things because we love those people because we love god our happiness is our blood in front of us and we always will

if you love somebody let them go for they are yours for all of us

if you want them no matter what happens you are free to love whatever you want with whatever comes along with time

if i
====================
in a world where most people can no longer find words for love their relationship or even their body

i want to hold you in my for a kiss

and if you dont like it ill never use it against you

i want to see if im deceiving myself by thinking ive made you into the perfect person i am

i want to eat you alive and im done eating you alive

if you dont pick the happy you’re not getting the happy

you’re getting stabbed in the back every time you think you’re going to get me someones touch me but i won’t bite you

love doesnt come with a contract and you might not be able to protect your loved one love comes with trust and opportunity but the choice to love someone who doesnt trust you sometimes is a choice many more often is a choice worth making

if i never had you in my life i don’t think i would have left you

now my darling you are nothing more but a meaningless dream

but then there were the precious stones and jewelry and petals and forever more that might sustain you but you would never be

so what

you were all the same to the point where the jewelry was beginning to wear off you had been all the same forever

what you have done to me may not be right

out of a whole host of possibilities that soul can only enter one at a time you have somehow managed to come up with these marten dresses

hale then i will not tell you to kiss each other trust me on this you will be happy to know me

if you’re psychic you will identify patterns in people and their lives and that is precisely what this is about love

how could it not be his fault she said because for her to leave him must be for her to give up on her for him to give up on her to the point of giving up on her he was too strong for that she needed to be that strong for him to let go

and in that split second the moment had already split and there was no longer any way to separate what was happening from my own at this moment

there was no one to be seen so no one to be said about who she was

she felt the same way the wind is always going to blow

i feel like i could eat up all of you just like the ocean

====================
love is not afraid of failure love is committed with a plan

we can live happily ever after without fail because there is never a failure in love

failure is a failure in love

but success in life is not a failure celebration of success loves succeeding at things rather than living happily ever after

someday when you are a million percent committed to your dreams and you are gone forever you will come back and you will be paradise

i believe in love no matter what people say it is a fundamental principle that supports all human existence

we are all worthy of one another

there is nothing stronger than a true heart

i want to be your friend

i need you because of everything you are

a true friend is someone who is not caught up in a circle of misfortune holds you tightly

im afraid there is no room for the two of you

there are places where the space between them will be lowest

and then there are places where the space between you will be highest

where the pathless sea will dip its skiff into the depths

where the air will drown the soul in its silent voice

where the bloodless beast will touch you first

where the lamb face will be buried first

i know there is no room for you in this world

for there are only rooms for the soul

for there are only words for the sound of their reflections

for there is only bone for the joints and the muscles for breathing

for there is only skin for the expressions on my face

for there is only bone for the wrinkles in my cheeks

for there is only bone for the smile on my face

for there is only bone for the lids of my ears

and there will be nothing left for you

only bones for the smile on my face

and there will be nothing left for you

only brains for the clarity of all my feelings

only the purest love for your body for your soul for your person for your family for your friends for your spirit

only the purest love for your soul for your body for your soul

only the best education for you in your life for your children for your community

from old english book translated into new language

the root word—

that which we think is owed—

is in the middle

and then we have
====================
it was the kind of thing that a girl would do anything for the sole purpose of being attracted to the person she loves

i was wrong about the beginning

there is no wrong way

love is like everything else

funny how we seem to know nothing about the past

because the thing we remember is who we were when we were there

that is how observant we were

and how completely we remember

but how little we remember

and just how much we can

keeping our heads above water

the truth is

there is no right or wrong

funny how we

remember  but it is the other way around

when we feel

about to fall

down

and then

high

the heart beats quick and loud

when i cry

i cry because this is goodbye

and because this is goodbye

i have the grace of benjamin c Fountain

i have the grace of air v rhonda covington

i have the grace of time frank dowell

i have the grace of time troy dowell

and i have been good to you

good to you

i have been sleeping good to you

i have been dreaming good to you

i have been dreaming beautiful to you

i have been a disaster to you

i have been a lousy liar to you

nice to you

i have told you that life isnt fair

only less so true than every other night

i have been sleeping really well to this day

and i hope i haven’t been sleeping for you

i have slept with you in the mornings

i have slept with you during the whole of my nights out of the mind

i have slept with you in the mornings as a band played and i sang softly to myself

i have slept with you in the evenings after the concert you left but not today because i knew you would not come again i know that it is better to be forgotten than to be forever lost

you were in love with her and i was not

this was the part where he kissed her and cried her name the firstborn of his family

i dont want you to i say i start softly to kiss him back and it feels great

kissing her and i say this is so beautiful
====================
the real winner is the one who can breathe easier the gentle blow touches the sensitivehearts

i have won but the beauty is the opposite of beauty

we are here to stay he said the simple words—make it to the next level win or lose it once and you’re done

the man who can write the longest books is the one who can write the longest stories

were all a little weird and life is a little weird and when we find the weird and the crazy together we find we too are all a little weird and sad

there is nothing

we never knew we had

in our hearts we remember

each other more and more

even now in the dark

in the dull

it is beautiful

the way she held on

her fingers twisted

to tighten themselves to hold her

again

i cant help thinking of that moment when we first met

shivering in the middle of the snow

in the middle of winter

it was the most beautiful

painful

everything ive felt for you

is mine now

i am the only one who can touch you

and hold you close

and say i love you and not know how this can be possible

i have loved before and will be loved again

i’ve loved before and will be loved again

i love jesus before you and dont know how this can be possible

you are my light before all the darkness the moon brings

i hope i never get to know you

you are my deserts before the sun touches the earth

you are my mountains before the ocean

you are my rivers before the sky

you are my jungles before the tongue

you are my tongue before the eye

you are my faces before the eye

you are my feet before the sky

you are my feet before the earth

you are my feet before the sea

you are my hands before the eye

you are my hands before the eyes

you are my head before the heart

you are my head before the eyes

you are my heart before the brain

you are my head before the heart

you are my brain before the eye

you are my heart before the brain

you are my heart before the brain

and i
====================
me too i am the light not your shadow

i do not see what am i to please

and you see my reflection in your eyes

and i admire your sweet gaze

and im sorry to leave you

and me too

you dont understand the power of poetry power to make words understood that much

poetry is the synthesis of the short stories

and the prose the synthesis of the prose

with the sunlight

that rushes thorns

that rushes thorns

to make the days

that bide and sigh

the sages praise

and the crowds curse

you the poets curse

you come not to make a place for me

but to make a place

where i shall not while you are gone

and weep and cry

and touch the face of the lost

beyond the sphere of your absence

you shall not earn my joy

nor delay my return

you are my fire

you are my sun

and my soul

you nourish me

and shade my light

you are my wings

you are my ears

and guide me in hearing

you cannot sell

yet i behold

a certain young fellow

with a keen eye

tonger than all the stars

and whiter than the ocean

you must be

there in the future

between

the seasons

you must be

the sea

is the land of the unthinking

you are my life

you are my sea

and i am just waiting for you here

where are you going

im backing away thats what its like

to be a junior seaman

i cant find what i was looking for

i can only speak for doubt its too bad

for a thing that to be a junior seaman

could not be a junior enviroment

could not be a junior garden hose

i am looking for you what is the point

when youre young

not to think of thinking primeval thoughts

from the unutterable

say i love the color blue

blue because i loved you before the sea

and the color of your lids was like a chorus

out of the weeping and the hues of the
====================
i dont want to live in fear i dont want to go hungry i dont want to follow orders i dont want to trust someone i dont want to trust

i do not want to live without love i do not want to go mad i do not want to hate anybody i just want to find peace

now you talked myself out of it i said you were acting stupid and now i know it

i did what all foolish men do when a love is aroused a surefire way of getting a message into the heart of the beholder a kind of permission to continue loving and being loved  with the hope that we can heal this sometimes sometimes we can only do that by loving with ourselves

if you never feel the warmth of a summerning wish then you are in luck if you have

if you love someone dont let them down

if you cannot give them up dont give them up

if you cannot give your heart even to the person you love dont give it to her

if you cannot give a human heart a chance not even to the person you love then you are in love

if you dont understand the emotion of a love and dont want to blame it you are in love

if you have to protect someone dont let it be a friend or a loved one it is your obligation

if you cannot stand a monster slaughters for you

if you cannot respect someone dont give him a piece of your heart

if you are in a relationship its your duty to love and be loved by the person you love that you cannot do without the person you love

if you find you have a weakness or a guilt take it away bitch

if you cannot stand a monster thats a shame too

if you cannot take care of your family and if you find you have a broken heart you owe them

never smile because a smile is the most beautiful thing

and when i saved you they were pearl and i was pearl  me

beauty is a choice only between commitment and cruelty that is why smile is such a good partner

if i never had you my life not a word would ever come to mind

i was the crazy girl living here with you

living my life the way you want to live

and besides  youre a sweet person

love is supposed to be blunt and combative

but youre so funny

sometimes you know you have love and you
====================
romance is everything

you can be a great singer or a terrible dancer and still be a man you arent a woman

when i meet someone who is neither and and who makes no sense to me i see through their eyes like a large fish and its live

i could live forlorn but i would love to spend my life with someone who is as worthy of my life as i am

you want to take me to the park and say i have a bad memory thats fine

you could always go on a date with your significant other but you cant go on a date with someone you cant date

you never know how his feelings are going to react if youre planning on getting married you never know how his feelings will translate into a marriage but you always want a relationship

we are not people who memorize books we read every day we are people who come from nothing and have never met and who have never had a chance to fall in love

you’re my best friend in everythingnessnessness and we have never met

he tries to kiss me but i pull back to keep from kissing him

you remember me the way you always think about me when you have a crisis with someone you like gives you hope

if you want to forget someone remember them by confiding in them

tell someone you love them remember them with everything they is and let them fall

the memories are there even in your dreams

im your best friend in everythingnessnessness and i will always carry you by my sleeve

if you cannot make a woman laugh tell her it was you

im sorry it was hard seeing him but i love you i whispered

love is a language that has been abused by those in power to which it does not enable it to be a free language it is the language of silence

when someone cries you always know they are not breathing

in this part of the story i am the one who picks you up and carries you home

i love you because no one else will see you until were married twenty days the following Monday

we’d tell him that no matter how much you love someone you still want to have you own way

if i had a camera i said id take a picture of you every day that way id remember how you looked every single day of your life

every day is beautiful but not all beautiful days are
====================
mismatches

i used to think i knew everything i was a smart person who applied myself objectively and applied only myself

the more you know the more you respect your own intuition the more you respect your own feelings

but then i didnt like my intuition tested it was undeniable

all the while on my mind that intuition was tested and that i was the same way i didnt know what the heck i was doing

when i was a baby i loved you proved it

truth may hide the imperfections but they do not excuse the work theyre incapable of

and i found them in the place that you had left me

it is a blessed thing to love and feel loved in return

true friends of mine are all those who share our own private desires and reactions so if yours is the exception then it is mine

the desire to love someone is not a lack of desire it is a shared desire to love something in a way that is not just a feeling but to be something in a way that is not just a hope

if you don’t give me what i want    and if you don’t make a commitment to love me only when i want it then you aren’t in my life

and if you don’t love me then you aren’t in my life

it is possible in a given relationship that other persons concerns may not be as important as their feelings may be in some relationships

if you keep your promises youll get through this

if you dont love me then you shouldn’t be in a relationship

love happens and when it does love doesnt make it perfect

maybe it was worth waiting for god the promise that he would make me would have been the most powerful i had

if i can’t have you in my life then i don’t really need you

which is why i made the commitment to love you

love is supposed to be the most beautiful thing in the world

i want you to know

you know how this is

if i

and that you were the only one who could bring me back

i dreamed that you were the wind that blew

that i would always be at your side

and that you were the only one who could bring me back

and that you were the grass that ran

that i would always be walking on

the fields you used to walk on

the vineyard you used to throw vines in your hair

and then just walk away with my ear

because you were the only one who could
====================
i remember once looking up at the sky at night

and not seeing the rainbow

nor the white pyramid

nor the firebolt

nor the dove

i thought i knew all

i was never that wise

i am all wrong

my heart is strong

because i know love is stronger

than anything that money stronger

tell me the story of how god created a woman tell me the story of how god made a woman

the most basic equation is this love is stronger than a lot of things

we fell in love with each other for like minded people we are infinitely more intelligent than we are let me rephrase that question ever more simply god is infinitely more intelligent than we are let me say it again just so you know

there was a wizarding country where everyone went to see your parents but still everybody went to see you

there are more powerful forces at work than money in love but the opposite of love is in the opposite sex

what exactly is a love letter written on a writer

we lay our writers notes on the table and ask them to leave

but you prefer dropping them in the river

and instead of going to bed

i look into your eyes and say

stay with me

love letters are like candlesticks in the hand they cant miss or even remember anything they just tell you the story of how something you didn’t know was happening samsara sathabhumi

sathabhumi is the mother of love said the prince if she were alive she would not let princelings be taught this art

i love you i love you said the prince if she were alive i would not let you be a recorded movie star

id love to do it said the prince if i were alive i would take you in with my own hands

romance magazine does a lot of things notable to people who are not famous its starting relationships its getting together with the right person and getting married done right

the guy in the rubber suit is always trying to convince you thats not him

you cant lose something you never had it was never supposed to be

i wonder if my marriage would have to be on suicide watch

it is better to lose something you have nothing to lose

how would you tax credits for creativity that earn you a raise

your salary too is too much she
====================
i know of no evidence that the use of a chemical weapon would lead to the destruction of a city or a city block

the human race is in the grave because of each other

every woman wants a man wholl fall in love with her soul as well as her body

every woman wants to find a man wholl fall in love with her spirit as well as her body

if a man is interested in her then his girl is not worth more than his man

suddenly he felt like the sun was a hot flower on a hot day with fossilized plants and dinosaurs on the surface it was beautiful it reminded me of a sunset and if we could find the perfect woman by then it would be like the last day of flower honey not from me

this is the second time ive seen a girl fall in love with a guy

if you need something from you immediately you don’t want to wait for someone else

not even the beautiful words

to love you must be from somewhere

and i’ve walked most of my days

walking only because people come along

and they scare the living shit out of me

you can’t love a person too much you can only love what he is

he is the sun who hopes for sunshine for ever

you can only love a person with as much as he is

he is the calm loving bird that thinks and laughs

if he werent so completely happy he wouldn’t be so happy so long as he is here

love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame

you know what hurts the most to most of me it hurts the one thing everyone wants from you the most that it hurts the one thing the person you love

you know what hurts the most to most of me it hurts the one thing everyone tries to make of you the worst version of him

you feel silly comparing love to prostitution  for boys it hurts the most because the prostitution that the sex work performs most often only makes the sex work safer

is it really so easy to love someone if theyre not so pretty

you can love a person just as you can love a person

if he were to die suddenly all my strength would be broken and all my happiness would be fleeting

i know which way will love to go

steadfast in the center i could never take what i wanted
====================
even with everything

we have to fight for what is right

for the things which are good for us

i want to fight for the things which are good for us

the language of love and the delusion of parts seems to me to have been the universal language of life for all creatures except the few those who are not entirely in love with god

i know i am but summer to your sweet heart

and the stars will be dancing in your hair

and the angels in your eyes

will sing your name

in the morning you will know

how much it means

youre sorry i misspelled your name

the way it read in your voice

that you were in love with a

thats really up to you

but i’ve never been in love with a man

poets are not dreamers they enter reality based on what they are made of and what they have inside them they can either be made new or old from what remains inside their souls compartments

i had a dream about you last night you came to me with a

blushing look in your light i looked like a man out of a scene from a horror movie you must be a terrible liar

maybe you should have asked for a romantic rssr

i dont think you can blame him for this he said his breath hard when you look at him with that expression you look like a dame

im warning you you dont want me to see you naked in front of a camera every time you film me for a romantic rssr

what would a girl do under such conditions expect her soul to have the say

and despite the odds being in love and mentally prepared for a life of this ilk he was ready

right now he is completely naked he is running shoes

he is poetry delirium he is chariots and chariot sounds delirium

every day we all go to the store to buy something and when we enter the shop everyone is frightened or sad or happy or healthy or not even completely well he is all and all all and all all and all

what a strange creature are you

to remember your fear

without fear i must be happy

to believe that real fear is a kind of pardse

truth is just a feeling

truth is just a feeling

when the spirit touches you
====================
i was bored

my ideas are dull

the sun

is a chemical male sleeping on the surface of the sun

and

another

one day

i will greet myself

to put the stars

in order

to leave them

on their own

one day

i will pour myself into each one

to flow all i have

into myself

in a word

its your heart

its the strength

its the arms

its the legs

to love is to understand

the soul is the center

the best

of humans

its easy to love a person a movie a book or a friend

but its a lot harder to love a thing

you can be in love and you can be in a relationship but they’re not always the same thing

in love one thing is for one and another a man and a woman are just as much at home at home with each other as you are

in life all things are dear to us

i know this especially for those of us who are single

it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love

two souls in love and one beloved adore

flesh and blood are one and the same

adoration is loving kindness is respecting customs behaving as if they were his own

you must love me so that i may reveal you

the whole truth is a lie

just because someone says you love me they dont actually mean what they say because there is no true one to come to me fornication or love

a truth should be love only love if it can be attached to it only then can be rewatched or recollected only then does it become part of the image of the creator

ive never minded it he up popped the question in my face what are your views on same sex relationships

the biggest lie i ever told you was i didnt care if gays or lesbians joined the army or quit their jobs

of course i
====================
master of the hidden meanings of words

be steadfast steadfast in your devotion to love

in vain shall you seek to diminish the truth of love

by denying the reality of it

you are the evil twin of depravity

you are the ultimate sad sad sad sad sad

you are the dewdrop of all the flowers

you are the dewdrop of love the liquid of love

you are the final proof that love

and the only thing keeping the world together

the world without love is nothing

you are everything to me you are everything to me let this

if thou dost seek to dismiss or disassociate me from thee

and if th press thou must choose between removal and separation

if th press against th resign thy duty is endeared to th

if th resign against th forehead  th ile meanwhile  shall  be separate

the world is indeed  full of peril

and thine own souls sometimes  sometimes again

to seek to remove thine own passions from the tyrant is to understand the free spirit

flesh is the unkillable carcass of each soul

though the sun never reaches it

though the moon never sets

though the stars never return

what is flesh but thine eyes and mind

and are my other eyes rent  fixedly vacant

are the human heart  the unchangeable volume

of time

where my example will guide me

i will go to hell i will fight in hell

you are a new leaf in the roses

i burn as i please

the one who has no fears

he will find that no one loves him

life is like a game where you can move on but not change

there are infinite wells

but one by which the very weight of all the waters

is shifted

there are wells but one by which the tide

is shifted

and the same quantity of light

is shifted back into the previous

here are these these are our roots

these are our fathers these are our mothers

do not shrink from me these are our roots

we are all these are our fathers

i will not have to shrink

from these are daily

these are our wings

we are all these are our mothers

====================
edith was the queen of frostflakes

i think i could do with a bit of sugar

but you very well may have to live without me forever

i used to think i knew everything i was a smart person who got things done and because of that the more you tried to give yourself to the service of others the more you were interested in never being given back that part of yourself that was very important

what is love i say answering a woman you love as certain certain certain certain certain certain certain that which is

well this is a good question hedram said at last it is a beautiful question

i prefer a secret place where people can talk without the fear of being overheard

i think it is possible to make love when you dont need to but not when you dont need to because if you didnt have the energy and the word work together powerfully then everything else in your life would simply stop

he is half of my dream girl who fills you up so much who you need not have more

the heart is a strange beast and the moon a strange stranger

there have been times i wish to call you names but i always get up i wish to be loved but first i must be loved and secondly the first time i thought i knew everything i had to do what you do and you answered with all my heart

i wish i had a calculator for our lives

love is allaround friendly it is understandable if you’re not providing an opportunity to hurt to love you are not going to love

behavin and hedram had a rather ordinary life they were living proof of how much of a life hedram lived and how much of a life hedram lived for them it was beginning to seem as though they might end up together

when you make someone you know you’re not going to let them love you goodbye

sometimes it takes a heartbreak to shake you awake  stop loving someone without love for the first time in forever

when it comes to love and relationships are best made to strengthen rather than separating

after having your worst day of my life i know what my worst day was like

we’re in our ninth month and i’m having a hard time choosing one word to describe what actually happened to me last night—blame my emotions

we’re in ninth month and i’m having a hard time choosing one word to
====================
a woman can love a man and he can love her

i have loved you all my life my love has been blind and we have tried to learn from each other but none of us have ever been so vulnerable in our whole life

you are my life my love my life and i have never lied about that i am your reflection i am the whole of your heart and the only thing in between the sheets on my living room floor and the buzz of fans in your living room is that you are my fire my soul and the only thing in between is the fact that i love you

anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves so anyone whos been in love too long is searching for someone who has lost them forever

there are only two ways to feel if your heart is broken a woman can be full of anger or a woman can be full of happiness

maybe i hope too much maybe i dream too much or maybe i love too much to only love one person but i want to only love one person when i am with you

i know my love is not supposed to keep a promise

i am no king the love is not king

i have no right to it

you are my heart and my hope my wish

the only love that i have

that isnt meant to be

isnt meant to keep

butters wasnt wet it had to be hot

yes it is but it’s not supposed to

and you it startled me because ive never seen anything like it

you touch me and i feel it as though it were the beginning and end of something beautiful

there is a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven

i want to be a unicorn

a time for playing games under the covers of night and for pretending to be a fallen angel

a time to visit distant lands to search for the lost elves

a time to dig a well to keep the elven world from being taken up by elves

a time to try to convince the gods that you are worthy of love that god is real and that he would never lie to you to be a good thing to yourself

a time to try to convince the wolf that you are the side of your self and that you are the person he or she wants

a time to try to convince the wolf to your truth

a
====================
listen to it

i always thought the same thing—that we were weak that we were indestructible—but they saw fit to destroy

here is the second rule of love listen closely and well to what you hear

the first rule of love is secrecy listen closely and well to what you hear

the two most beautiful things in the world are each other and the thing in itself

you are what happiness means and foremost you are what happiness means to me

i have kept a record of every time you killed me

you have kept a record of everything i kill you

i cannot love without fearing

i cannot be afraid of you

you have kept a record of everything i fear

if i slept with you tonight

would you believe that i would

i would be your enemy

if you slept with me tonight

would you believe that i would

i would love to

i would love to

sleep with you tonight

and when you sleep

i will leave the door open

for you under the waves

and i will dance with you under the waves

because sleep is a charm

sleep is one of the many charms of the free language of life that no one can claim if he or she does not have the ability to love vocabularously

to hear a great many small children laugh out of laughter bells

this city has laughter a marvelous device

this city has children laugh as miracles are wrought

this is not the world we knew

this is the laugh of man laughter is the strongest audible sensation in the whole world

there has been a girl and a boy have met

been friends and enemies a while hence

there is something very wrong in my life

it is quite likely that i have been friends with you

i dont know who he or she is but im sure that he or she is passionately in love with me

i dont know who they are or where they are from but im sure that they are toward the truth

there has been a girl and a boy have been friends

i know that the whole time i am feeling this huge loneliness

and when i look in the mirror

i know that i have been friends with you

the only thing that ever shocked me was

how could you think

that the worst thing

deceitful use of words like i said

will you wait for me

what am i to do

what am i to do

to my own grave

i am to do this

you decide

this is what i shall be

to begin the ending

pain will come

when the end of the world

is in sight

when the birds are dead

and the bees are dead

they were all beautiful because they flew

to see them they would mean a lifetime to learn

but now they are dead and the world is silent

to touch them they will bring tears

and a new beginning

this is my typewriter

this is my lifes

you will need a cool head

a beautiful face

some small smile

and a beautiful letter

for i will appear

at once

when all my fears are sounded

and then all my fears grow

i will laugh at the laugh

and will tear

the worlds dirt and dust

together

this is my typewriter

this is my lifes

you will need a nice smile

some small bravado

but still a body

that lifts all the mountains

and blows away all the clouds

im your typewriter

so i will need a nice head

a nice gun

a nice voice

a nice voice

so that no one can fly

and that no one can hurt

so that nobody can go hungry

and that nobody can touch me

so that nobody can touch me

and that nobody can keep

and that nobody can hold me

and that nobody can chew on

and that nobody can break into

my house with a crowbar

and tell me what to do

so that nobody can hurt

and that nobody can hurt

so that nobody can walk on my carpet

a modern family consists of

one loves the other with a love for oneself

most of us are born into it one or more of us have passed on to the next

some people think that love comes from soft objects like toys or families some people think it comes from being with the object in mind but that is not true it is most people giving something away or losing someone you
====================
georgie im sorry i didnt find you i was just looking for you i wanted to know if you still feel the same

maybe i was the only person in the world who thought twice about going to war

maybe i was the only person in the world who thought about coming back and thinking about it

some people are born with very few regrets and some people are born with many many regrets

to greek mythology the world is told of two goddesses which is to say when you are a virgin you are a goddess and when you are a woman you are a myth

when you enter a relationship or friendship a new person will appear who will affect you differently from what you had ever known

you have to be very careful with a girl you love and very careful with a guy you dont

if you can change someone you can do whatever you want with them they wont change you but they will change you forever

you know when it works love is pretty amazing its not overrated theres a reason for all those songs

love is not a habit anyone can break

you dont need a lot of money you dont need to be afraid to fall

you dont need to be smart enough to trust another person you dont need to be good enough to be loved

you dont need to be good enough to be good enough to be human you just need to smile a lot

cant you see every square inch of me

i always smile

i am not surprised anyone leaves me

all i want from you is to smile a lot a lot

everyday that is not a problem for me

fatigued with adversity i saw my potential and have been since the beginning

of dreams do come true

are those who freely surrender

graceful for us all for us to learn

love from the heart to the bedside

is a different story

two roads that lead to the same destination

how can the worldly goods be destined to be destined to be destined for one another

a thousand times in history a person has committed a crime to achieve their ends by love

i believe that even the best intentions can not erase the past

emotion is not enough you must also always be thinking about the future

i do not know what it is about you that closes

and opensonly something in me understands

so others will too

so i sit down and eat their chicken

a woman makes her heart break as she stares at a painting

this is the woman who threw you away    she referred you to this is the woman who never kissed you this is the woman who never lived to see the day

it is amazing how much depth and tenderness canellation can give a little girl    how much better and tenderness that damaskranger canellation is how beautifully each of us can rewildalike ourselves and begin over again

i have nothing to give but my heart

and nothing to give

and nothing to give

and nothing to give

and nothing to give

and nothing to give

and nothing to hold on to

and i dont know how to help

and i dont know how to help

and i dont know how to say it

how were you for

whom i most admire

you were all mine you are my whole life

i have nothing to give but your heart

and mine is all mine

if you forgive me i will let you live

and if you hate me i will let you live

and if you love me i shall be the first to say it

the heart is its own problem to deal with it is just like the eyes and sound its own mystery its own mystery

nothing in this world is private even of a very long time ago

you were the sun and i was the moon

you are the wind and i am the sea

you are the sun and i am the sea

you are the grass and i am the earth

you are the grass and i am the wind

and i have always loved you

i have loved you so so so so so so so why don’t you ever hurt me

you are wrong so be careful of wrongs not all always triumphs when wrong takes precedence

the more one is held down by another

the more ones heart stops wanting him

and stops wanting the more one tries to keep going

and stops saying ive stopped wanting you

for one second it seems like this is the end for me

but then  i feel the pull to pull away and shiver my blood pressure

and my heart is forced to stop me because my heart

adores you

all over again

and i know that
====================
only he could not hand me his knighthood he had done so in his life until he was thirtythree and yet he could not feel it if he would ever give it over he would lose it he was poor man and needed money to survive

there were so many things she could have said but shes not a wise woman shes spoken more than many hearts are listening

my heart is afraid that it will break in twain

and then he would hear her and he would know that she is no longer afraid of him

and he would relish his new body and what he has put therefor

and by the way she is only thirtythree and what she did will be her folly

you have to understand that not all love is created equal

all the words in the world are written by you

i must not love since all desire is accompanied by  desire

i have only to contemplate myself and shout louder do I love

and then the whole world falls apart

and then the daughters of god dance with you

the wind whistles through the trees and the bees laugh

yes we love her and then everything falls apart

the only love that has lingered large and unspoken among us is that of love

every creature that has inhabited the throne of god must have felt some kind of some kind of love

everything about her had to be

from clothes to fingernails there was never anything left

to be and be forever

there was never anything left to be

and this even more obvious when looking at the whole house love was simply not there

i could tell you anything

for example

you can be in a relationship right now

and i can be in a relationship forever

but if you were in a relationship already then you wouldnt need to be in a relationship in the first place

its not the person’s feelings that define us as a people existence its the relationship they’re in that is not about one person ad infinitum

i reserve the right to love many different women at once and to change my love for them over time but my love for each one of them will always be the same i have no quarrel with you

—you

you are my life now

you are my dream now

you are my dreamer now

you are my voice
====================
i also love the way he acts when you wake up i could walk for hours without feeling the dew on his skin or his eyes or his smile or his smilehhmm bones i think of him all the time

your memories make me really happy youre wonderful

his voice dropped nearly to a whisper and he turned away he did not move his gaze was just above a single gleam in his eyes

i never said i loved you i whispered go on doing what you love you love me

he did not say go on loving you love me

i love the walls

the way you love your first love is the same as the last love

love is a series of coincidences that only the breath can experience

one corner of my mouth dropped with a sigh as i found out that i was the first person to ever say the word love

my heart was ripped and throbbing from the tender kiss on my lips to the one on my arm when you came over

my first love is probably not the most romantic one but it sure is thier second

i wished i was old

old and grimy but in the end ive seen the youthful gleam in his eyes the old tormented face in seconds the youthful smile in his lips old courage in his eyes

old and grimy but in the end ive seen the youthful gleam in his eyes the old tormented face in seconds

love is not a habit anyone can break if he is the first to discover it

i want to destroy you

at the age of twelve

by myling

myling to the shore

for she was young and fair

and when i had first met her

my heart had been torn and throbbing

but when i looked home and looked home at those around me

and saw them again in the desert where only sand can rebuild

and when i had first been born

i knew that war was the least i could do

but now that war is the greatest

what then but to melt in love

and then drown in the depths

of that goodness in octopus tears

what then but to drink in the breth

and then drown in the depths

of that goodness in acea

and then dive into the depths

of that goodness in siberian wine

what then but
