“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

“Dare to Be

When a new day begins, dare to smile gratefully.

When there is darkness, dare to be the first to shine a light.

When there is injustice, dare to be the first to condemn it.

When something seems difficult, dare to do it anyway.

When life seems to beat you down, dare to fight back.

When there seems to be no hope, dare to find some.

When you’re feeling tired, dare to keep going.

When times are tough, dare to be tougher.

When love hurts you, dare to love again.

When someone is hurting, dare to help them heal.

When another is lost, dare to help them find the way.

When a friend falls, dare to be the first to extend a hand.

When you cross paths with another, dare to make them smile.

When you feel great, dare to help someone else feel great too.

When the day has ended, dare to feel as you’ve done your best.

Dare to be the best you can –

At all times, Dare to be!”

“Get Off The Scale!

You are beautiful. Your beauty, just like your capacity for life, happiness, and success, is immeasurable. Day after day, countless people across the globe get on a scale in search of validation of beauty and social acceptance.

Get off the scale! I have yet to see a scale that can tell you how enchanting your eyes are. I have yet to see a scale that can show you how wonderful your hair looks when the sun shines its glorious rays on it. I have yet to see a scale that can thank you for your compassion, sense of humor, and contagious smile. Get off the scale because I have yet to see one that can admire you for your perseverance when challenged in life.

It’s true, the scale can only give you a numerical reflection of your relationship with gravity. That’s it. It cannot measure beauty, talent, purpose, life force, possibility, strength, or love. Don’t give the scale more power than it has earned. Take note of the number, then get off the scale and live your life. You are beautiful!”

The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the almshouse as brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace.”

Always Say Less Than Necessary

When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control.

“Perfectly Imperfect

We have all heard that no two snowflakes are alike. Each snowflake takes the perfect form for the maximum efficiency and effectiveness for its journey. And while the universal force of gravity gives them a shared destination, the expansive space in the air gives each snowflake the opportunity to take their own path. They are on the same journey, but each takes a different path.
Along this gravity-driven journey, some snowflakes collide and damage each other, some collide and join together, some are influenced by wind... there are so many transitions and changes that take place along the journey of the snowflake. But, no matter what the transition, the snowflake always finds itself perfectly shaped for its journey.
I find parallels in nature to be a beautiful reflection of grand orchestration. One of these parallels is of snowflakes and us. We, too, are all headed in the same direction. We are being driven by a universal force to the same destination. We are all individuals taking different journeys and along our journey, we sometimes bump into each other, we cross paths, we become altered... we take different physical forms. But at all times we too are 100% perfectly imperfect. At every given moment we are absolutely perfect for what is required for our journey. I’m not perfect for your journey and you’re not perfect for my journey, but I’m perfect for my journey and you’re perfect for your journey. We’re heading to the same place, we’re taking different routes, but we’re both exactly perfect the way we are.
Think of what understanding this great orchestration could mean for relationships. Imagine interacting with others knowing that they too each share this parallel with the snowflake. Like you, they are headed to the same place and no matter what they may appear like to you, they have taken the perfect form for their journey. How strong our relationships would be if we could see and respect that we are all perfectly imperfect for our journey.”

Never Appear Too Perfect

Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies.

Think As You Like But Behave Like Others

“War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things: the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth a war, is much worse. When a people are used as mere human instruments for firing cannon or thrusting bayonets, in the service and for the selfish purposes of a master, such war degrades a people. A war to protect other human beings against tyrannical injustice; a war to give victory to their own ideas of right and good, and which is their own war, carried on for an honest purpose by their free choice, — is often the means of their regeneration. A man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for, nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. As long as justice and injustice have not terminated their ever-renewing fight for ascendancy in the affairs of mankind, human beings must be willing, when need is, to do battle for the one against the other.”

You've got to think high to rise,
You've got to be sure of yourself before
You can ever win a prize.

To the stronger or faster man,
But soon or late the man who wins
Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!”

Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you altogether.

Tell yourself,

You do not deserve this!

All those toxic words you have to listen from people,

All those fears they try to pin on your mind,

All those giggles they aim at your dreams,

All those cages that do not let your imagination fly free,

Listen deeply, you do not deserve any of it.

My dear fellow human, you do not deserve this hostility.

You are born wild, You do not deserve to be tamed!”

“We've also evolved the ability to simply 'pay it forward': I help you, somebody else will help me. I remember hearing a parable when I was younger, about a father who lifts his young son onto his back to carry him across a flooding river. 'When I am older,' said the boy to his father, 'I will carry you across this river as you now do for me.' 'No, you won't,' said the father stoically. 'When you are older you will have your own concerns. All I expect is that one day you will carry your own son across this river as I no do for you.' Cultivating this attitude is an important part of Humanism--to realize that life without God can be much more than a series of strict tit-for-tat transactions where you pay me and I pay you back. Learning to pay it forward can add a tremendous sense of meaning and dignity to our lives. Simply put, it feels good to give to others, whether we get back or not.”

“But confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who relies entirely upon fortune is lost when it changes. I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from what I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the other does not.”

Make the stands gasp as we blow into an unearthly kick from three hundred yards out! We can become God's own messengers delivering the dreaded scrolls! We can race dark Satan himself till he wheezes fiery cinders down the back straightaway....They'll speak our names in hushed tones, 'those guys are animals' they'll say! We can lay it on the line, bust a gut, show them a clean pair of heels. We can sprint the turn on a spring breeze and feel the winter leave our feet! We can, by God, let our demons loose and just wail on!”

“MY FIVE DOS FOR GETTING BACK INTO THE GAME:
1. Do expect defeat. It’s a given when the stakes are high and the competition is working ferociously to beat you. If you’re surprised when it happens, you’re dreaming; dreamers don’t last long.
2. Do force yourself to stop looking backward and dwelling on the professional “train wreck” you have just been in. It’s mental quicksand.
3. Do allow yourself appropriate recovery—grieving—time. You’ve been knocked senseless; give yourself a little time to recuperate. A keyword here is “little.” Don’t let it drag on.
4. Do tell yourself, “I am going to stand and fight again,” with the knowledge that often when things are at their worst you’re closer than you can imagine to success. Our Super Bowl victory arrived less than sixteen months after my “train wreck” in Miami.
5. Do begin planning for your next serious encounter. The smallest steps—plans—move you forward on the road to recovery. Focus on the fix.

MY FIVE DON’TS:
1. Don’t ask, “Why me?”
2. Don’t expect sympathy.
3. Don’t bellyache.
4. Don’t keep accepting condolences.
5. Don’t blame others.”

There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.”

“There’s an interesting story about Abraham Lincoln. During the American Civil War he signed an order transferring certain regiments, but Secretary of War Edwin Stanton refused to execute it, calling the president a fool. When Lincoln heard he replied, ‘If Stanton said I’m a fool then I must be, for he’s nearly always right, and he says what he thinks. I’ll step over and see for myself.’ He did, and when Stanton convinced him the order was in error, Lincoln quietly withdrew it. Part of Lincoln’s greatness lay in his ability to rise above pettiness, ego, and sensitivity to other people’s opinions. He wasn’t easily offended. He welcomed criticism, and in doing so demonstrated one of the strengths of a truly great person: humility. So, have you been criticised? Make it a time to learn, not lose.”

What if they refuse? Should I inform them how difficult it was to convince her to marry me?

Every day the ritual is followed, but we get used to the loss like we get used to the unanswered prayers, we stop thinking about the win, although bad feelings grip us from time to time but it passes very quickly, And just as losers justify their loss, we become addicted to a thought process which only blames other people and situation for our loss.”

ما تحددش نجاحك أو فشلك بناء على رأي الناس في اللي بتعمله ،

“Thank you, Mr. Secretary General, UNICEF Executive Director, Excellencies and distinguished guests from across the world.

My name is Kim Nam Jun, also known as RM, the leader of the group BTS. It’s an incredible honour to be invited to an occasion with such significance for today’s young generation.

Last November, BTS launched the “Love Myself” campaign with UNICEF, building on our belief that “true love first begins with loving myself.” We have been partnering with UNICEF’s #ENDviolence program to protect children and young people all over the world from violence.

Our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their action and enthusiasm. We truly have the best fans in the world!

I would like to begin by talking about myself.

I was born in Ilsan, a city near Seoul, South Korea. It’s a beautiful place, with a lake, hills, and even an annual flower festival. I spent a happy childhood there, and I was just an ordinary boy.

I would look up at the night sky in wonder and dream the dreams of a boy. I used to imagine that I was a superhero, saving the world.

In an intro to one of our early albums, there is a line that says, “My heart stopped…I was maybe nine or ten.”

Looking back, that’s when I began to worry about what other people thought of me and started seeing myself through their eyes. I stopped looking up at the stars at night. I stopped daydreaming. I tried to jam myself into moulds that other people made. Soon, I began to shut out my own voice and started to listen to the voices of others. No one called out my name, and neither did I. My heart stopped and my eyes closed shut. So, like this, I, we, all lost our names. We became like ghosts.

I had one sanctuary, and that was music. There was a small voice in me that said, ‘Wake up, man, and listen to yourself!” But it took me a long time to hear music calling my name.

Even after making the decision to join BTS, there were hurdles. Most people thought we were hopeless. Sometimes, I just wanted to quit.

I think I was very lucky that I didn’t give it all up.

I’m sure that I, and we, will keep stumbling and falling. We have become artists performing in huge stadiums and selling millions of albums.

But I am still an ordinary, twenty-four-year-old guy. If there’s anything that I’ve achieved, it was only possible because I had my other BTS members by my side, and because of the love and support of our ARMY fans.

Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me. I am who I am today, with all my faults. Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that’s me, too. These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I was, who I am, and who I hope to become.

I would like to say one last thing.

After releasing the “Love Yourself” albums and launching the “Love Myself” campaign, we started to hear remarkable stories from our fans all over the world, how our message helped them overcome their hardships in life and start loving themselves. These stories constantly remind us of our responsibility.

So, let’s all take one more step. We have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to "speak yourself".

I would like to ask all of you. What is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat?

Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, gender identity: speak yourself.

Find your name, find your voice by speaking yourself.

I’m Kim Nam Jun, RM of BTS.

I’m a hip-hop idol and an artist from a small town in Korea.

Like most people, I made many mistakes in my life.

I have many faults and I have many fears, but I am going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I’m starting to love myself, little by little.

What is your name? Speak Yourself!”

“Economy means to consume less than you have. Your states, in exchange, call economic prosperity the increase of consume and decrease of production. This consumption increase presented to you proudly during the election campaigns are due to the refinancing of loans, which are, actually, re-loans.

In other words, the leadership of your state spends what it does not hold, so that you, the people, are forced to give back something that you never benefited of, and you pay for money that you never spent.”

“Life is not days or years, past or probable future. Life is Now. Life is countless moments of _Now_.
Every single one of that moments
is a point in time in which you decide
what you _choose_ to _make_ your life to be.
We are not twigs, being carried down the current of a river!
We are the Creators, never at a mercy of some outside forces, so stop finding excuses and feeling small! You will seek that feeling only when you're trying to _avoid responsibility_.

We are free to choose.
But yes, that requires courage.
It requires stepping out of the comfort zone and actually working hard for what matters most.
It requires responsibility.
It requires a leap of faith into the unknown.

“What is my goal,
what is my task,
what is my path through life?

Must be this trail
I thread upon,
bringing hope to strife ...

I was born with memory
of the future world,
the one of love and reverie,
the one that once got sold ...

I cried and shrieked,
a little girl,
when losing sight of you,
disbelief at desert land
that I was to walk through.

Rivers, they again will flow,
skies just open roads,
hearts of men again will glow,
light-immersed abodes.”

I am the light of the world which descended in the swamp of lie and cleaned it. I am the hair of the woman washing Your feet and the eyes crying for Your wounds.”

I want to know your intention of “wanting to know me”. I don’t want, that you create an image of me based on your questions, but based on who truly I am.”

So, stop worrying about the basic needs of survival and give your whole being to something meaningful.”
― Abhijit Naskar, Monk Meets World

“What is it about us that we take such inspiration from the lives of those who triumph over tragedy? Is it as simple as that we love a story with a happy ending, or does it go deeper than that? Could it be because we never really know if, within ourselves, we have the strength to bear such tragedy and survive such intense grief? Or is it that we too actually do know pain—and along with more than a few tears—we know from experience, that after the pain, there does again come a time for joy, because we have our own story. And could it be that for everything we’ve been through, that no one really knows us—especially, if we keep it all a secret.”

“We’re not born running up mountains. Most of us don’t even figure out we’re capable of such a feat until later in life. Along the way, we make a lot of mistakes. Some of us even hit rock bottom. And then we pick ourselves up, dust off the dirt, and start climbing — sometimes literally. Running is a transformative experience in mind, body and spirit for so many. It helps us face inner demons and shush the naysayers — especially when those naysayers are ourselves.”

“In space we find our self, and lose our self, because we come to find that we are what defines the space in form and in thought.”
― Mike Stagnitta

“To use space and not allow it to use you, you must first accept your authoring of it, just as you are the author of your influence on the world around you. So then we must understand first that we are the architect’s of our life, and the author’s of our story. The same is true for space. To enjoy it we must accept it for what it is. We must define the purpose of space, yet seek less purpose in it in order to extract greater purpose from it.”
― Mike Stagnitta

“That energy of each person is carried into the next space, and the next, the collective result of perceptions, thoughts and emotions create the experience of the world we live in. So if you want to change the world for the better, change yourself first, or better yet, lose yourself. You must lose the desire to control everything and instead find the love in everything. Oftentimes we need a push to get here. This “push” can be in the form of a healthy environment. One that stimulates innovation, encourages growth and embraces connectedness.”

Therefore, if I do not need wealth, I am prosperous, if I do not need to be seen, I am sought after, if I do not need to be loved, I am love, if I do not need admiration, I am able to admire, if I do not need success, I am successful, if I do not need time, I am timeless, if I do not need to know, then I know everything. So it is, if I know death, poverty, hate, failure and time as words, I then know their opposites, and if I know their opposites I know that both sides hold only the weight that I give them, and in turn both are weightless; they hold no weight to me, or in other words, they are unimportant and illusory. So then if I do not need an illusion, I am free, and if I do not need freedom, I exist, and if I exist, I am, and if I am, I am. That is the truth. That is the word. That is nonduality.”

“What is a word? What is the word death without its meaning to us? What is the word life without it’s meaning to us? Is it meaningless? Does it in fact have less meaning? Less meaning implies opposition. Less meaning than what? What is life or death without the meaning we attach to it. Without the words life or death, If In fact we knew them not, what then would they be? The answer is simple, nothing... no thing. So then what is a word, if not a fabrication made to solve the problem of not knowing. Not knowing is the beautiful landscape of life, of being. We act like we know what death is, and go on experiencing it while we think we are living. The word for this is irony or more specifically tragedy.”

“between the love
and the lust,
between the feelings
and the hormones,
between the heart
and the body
love, feelings and the heart
prevails over everything else.”
― Jyoti Patel

“You make some great promises in this journey called ‘life’. You tell people that you love them and need them but, in the end, you leave them in silence because, you feel heavy and lost & everything feels tough to you all of a sudden, you leave them in the hope that you find someone better but, one day, life lets you realize that it is not easy to find someone with ‘perfectionism”
― Jyoti Patel

“Everyone has faults and problems, everyone is wishing to have someone but, you see, people keep falling in and out of love so quickly, people give up on relationships so easily nowadays for, we always keep craving for something more, something new and trendy but you know, you are not trained to see the greatness in old school love.”
― Jyoti Patel

“Sit right there and think about it for a while, how beautiful it is to find someone who wants to spend quality time with you without technology and who fully be present in the conversation. How great it would be to be with someone who helps you to grow, who focus on your inner beauty and the one who apologizes when they know they should.”
― Jyoti Patel

“I personally feel and believe that relationships are neither useless nor pointless; it is you who make it feel so, I believe, love is so beautiful, it feels so perfect with the right person but, your life changes for the bad if you are with someone who cannot support you, who never encourages you, who can’t stand with you, that’s not love by the way! You just name is as love and escape the moment it feels tough.”
― Jyoti Patel

“Just because of one or two or few failed relationships, people stop believing in love and some people never even care to look at love in a good way because of what others say, just because of others opinions and judgments. Some say, ‘men are dogs’ and some guys firmly believe ‘women only fall in love with rich men’. No! That’s not true! Not every guy goes after ‘sexy’ girls and not every woman goes after rich men!

I want you to stop looking at the world in such a judgmental and horrible way perhaps, it’s not the right way.”
― Jyoti Patel

“I don’t want you to give up on love and you should never stop believing in love. It’s just that, you never actually felt love; you never met someone ‘real’. Let me tell you something, if you don’t believe in love, you will never receive it and you will never appreciate it even when it is so near to you. If you always be stuck in the negative thoughts about love, there is a huge chance that you let it go even when it is totally and truly trying to be yours! It’s just so simple, you can’t attract something you hate, and you can’t get something you push away so effortlessly.”
― Jyoti Patel

“Sometimes, we give up on people at the first signs of trouble, some people are in this false belief that love takes away independence, so they feel more comfortable when they are single, the saddest part is, such people end up being depressed, lonely and sad one day because, they fail to understand that love doesn’t take away the independence, love lets us fly, love helps us grow, love challenges you, stays with you being your shadow and love doesn’t leave you in the dark.”
― Jyoti Patel

“Sometimes, in life, you always want to have what you can’t have. At times, you feel that relationships aren’t your top priority so you get distracted with other things. Some feel that they are too young to settle down, so they hop from person to person to person. They are the most confused souls on the earth, they are unsure about themselves.”
― Jyoti Patel

“Trust me; this world would be far worse without love. Love & humanity is all we need, and thanks to the universe that we still didn’t run out of love, there are millions of kind-hearted, caring and loving humans around us, if you are one of them, my big thanks to you for trying to make this world a better place to live in. You matter! You are beautiful!”

They are all broken
Don’t break yourself for any!”
― Jyoti Patel

“They tell you
That the world will love you back
If you love yourself enough
I am sorry to say
It doesn’t really work in that way
Know your worth
When someone treats you like
You are ordinary
Know your worth
When he fails to appreciate you
Know your worth
When he tells you that
He no longer needs you
Know your worth
When she cannot love you fully
Know your worth
They tell you
That the world will love you back
If you love yourself enough
I am sorry to say
It doesn’t really work in that way”

“Don’t forget to
raise your voice
when their words
hurt your soul.

Don’t forget to shove,
when they try to hush you.

If every time you look
at yourself, and
all that you can see is
the ruined mascara,
dry lips and burning eyes
Girl,
that’s the proof for you
to pack your bags and leave.

If they bury you
with the roses and
burn you alive
with their words
Girl,
that’s the proof for you
to pack your bags and leave.

Don’t forget to
raise your voice
when their words
hurt your soul.

Don’t forget to shove,
when they try to hush you.”

Always remember, beauty is more than skin deep. It is not what you see outside.”
― Jyoti Patel

“You whisper, you keep quiet, you shout, you cry and then, you choose silence because, during some moments of life, you truly believe that nothing can make you smile again but soon, not so easily but definitely, you come across someone who falls in love with you, every inch and every part of you, with your scars, with your past, with your voice, with your twists and turns.”
― Jyoti Patel

“Life would be so good when people choose to talk to each other instead of talking about each other in the wrong ways before finding out the facts, life would be so better when someone chooses to not give the hate speeches with no deep understanding, life would be great without internet trolls.

“Sharon passed around a handout: "Triangle of Self-Actualization" by Abraham Maslow. The levels of human motivation. It resembled the nutrition triangle put out by the FDA, with five horizontal levels of multiple colors. I vaguely remembered it from my one college psychology course in the 1970's.
"Very applicable with refugees," Sharon said. "Maslow theorized that one could not move to a higher level until the prior level was satisfied. The first level, the triangle base, is physiological needs. Like food and water. Until a person has enough to eat and drink, that's all one would be concerned with."
I'd never experienced not being able to satisfy my thirst or hunger, but it sounded logical that that would be my only concern in such a situation. For the Lost Boys, just getting enough food and water had been a daily struggle. I wondered what kind of impact being stuck at the bottom level for the last fourteen years would have on a person, especially a child and teen.
"The second level is safety and security. Home. A sanctuary. A safe place."
Like not being shot at or having lions attack you. They hadn't had much of level two, either. Even Kakuma hadn't been safe. A refugee camp couldn't feel like home.
"The third level is social. A sense of belonging."
Since they'd been together, they must have felt like they belonged, but perhaps not on a larger scale, having been displaced from home and living in someone else's country.
"Once a person has food, shelter, family and friends, they can advance to the fourth level, which is ego. Self-esteem."
I'd never thought of those things occurring sequentially, but rather simultaneously, as they did in my life. If I understood correctly, working on their self-esteem had not been a large concern to them, if one at all. That was bound to affect them eventually. In what way remained to be seen. They'd been so preoccupied with survival that issues of self-worth might overwhelm them at first. A sure risk for insecurity and depression.
The information was fascinating and insightful, although worrisome in terms of Benson, Lino, and Alepho. It also made me wonder about us middle-and upper-class Americans. We seldom worried about food, except for eating too much, and that was not what Maslow had been referring to. Most of us had homes and safety and friends and family. That could mean we were entirely focused on that fourth level: ego. Our efforts to make ourselves seem strong, smart, rich, and beautiful, or young were our own kind of survival skill. Perhaps advancing directly to the fourth level, when the mind was originally engineered for the challenges of basic survival, was why Prozac and Zoloft, both antidepressants, were two of the biggest-selling drugs in America.
"The pinnacle of the triangle," Sharon said, "is the fifth level. Self-actualization. A strong and deeply felt belief that as a person one has value in the world. Contentment with who one is rather than what one has. Secure in ones beliefs. Not needing ego boosts from external factors. Having that sense of well-being that does not depend on the approval of others is commonly called happiness."
Happiness, hard to define, yet obvious when present. Most of us struggled our entire lives to achieve it, perhaps what had brought some of us to a mentoring class that night.”

“It’s all about having the heart … to leave the city and its false glitter for home if you’ve tried long enough and still can’t make it. I would be a big liar to tell you it’s easy to survive after having left home for years. You’re almost like a child when you return – you are starting from the scratch. But you have to behave like a child too if you’re ready to survive; be ever eager to learn. Get ready to take insults from every village rats set to eat your yams of respect and pride. Toe the line till you settle down properly and begin to understand the ways of the people back home. People would laugh at you at first but when your conditions start improving, everyone would laugh with you. Don’t forget the saying of our people: the same mouth that speaks of evil is the same mouth that speaks of good. It’s the heart to go back not minding the years that have been wasted. That is the secret.”

Every struggle to achieve
A good thing in life,
You'll meet opposition.
Don't be daunted,
Stay determined and focussed
And somehow you'd get
To your destination.
Obstructions are only
Artificial walls that
Are hammered down
By your doggedness.
You have to prove
You have resilience
Before you finally
Can cruise to success.
And don't be surprised
That success brings
Everyone wanting
To hop into your bus –
They would hug, hail
And cheer; everyone would
Celebrate you, of course.
Everything you do,
Do it well and this
Would bring you every
Single friend and fan.
In everyone is the streak of
A champion: we step out
With our talent to further
Our fabulous plan.”

“God designed love to make the world living;
so if world's dying, we know what's missing.
When missing, God designed another thing:
"This one is hatred-to do repairing."

Oh, how the world treats hatred as beastly;
yet sans hatred, who'll fight depravity?
Hatred used to correct is celestial;
but when used to oppress, it is bestial.”

“I know that in every age, in every place, love is certain to be present, anonymous to be found and concrete to be held onto, so there is no reason to tremble because life on earth is nothing but one brief moment, a moment truly worth living for, which becomes even wealthier when it is for someone like you. I have found that out by being with you. Having you in my life has brought me more happiness than a lifetime could bring. You've touched my life and my soul, so deeply in your own way that you’ve helped me laugh and become my true self. I feel like I've searched my whole life and I have finally found the one meant for me and even though our time together was short, it will not be forgotten but remembered forever and ever. I pray to the almighty that everything in future comes out perfect for us.”

“When I was growing up it was still acceptable—not to me but in social terms—to say that one was not interested in science and did not see the point in bothering with it. This is no longer the case. Let me be clear. I am not promoting the idea that all young people should grow up to be scientists. I do not see that as an ideal situation, as the world needs people with a wide variety of skills. But I am advocating that all young people should be familiar with and confident around scientific subjects, whatever they choose to do. They need to be scientifically literate, and inspired to engage with developments in science and technology in order to learn more.
A world where only a tiny super-elite are capable of understanding advanced science and technology and its applications would be, to my
mind, a dangerous and limited one. I seriously doubt whether long-range beneficial projects such as cleaning up the oceans or curing diseases in the developing world would be given priority. Worse, we could find that
technology is used against us and that we might have no power to stop it.
I don’t believe in boundaries, either for what we can do in our personal lives or for what life and intelligence can accomplish in our universe. We stand at a threshold of important discoveries in all areas of science. Without doubt, our world will change enormously in the next fifty years. We will find out what happened at the Big Bang. We will come to understand how life began on Earth. We may even discover whether life exists elsewhere in the universe. While the chances of communicating with an intelligent extra-terrestrial species may be slim, the importance of such a discovery means we must not give up trying. We will continue to explore our cosmic habitat, sending robots and humans into space. We cannot continue to look inwards at ourselves on a small and increasingly polluted and overcrowded planet. Through scientific endeavour and technological innovation, we must look outwards to the wider universe, while also striving to fix the problems on Earth. And I am optimistic that we will ultimately create viable habitats for the human race on other planets. We will transcend the Earth and learn to exist in space.
This is not the end of the story, but just the beginning of what I hope will be billions of years of life flourishing in the cosmos.
And one final point—we never really know where the next great scientific discovery will come from, nor who will make it. Opening up the thrill and wonder of scientific discovery, creating innovative and accessible ways to reach out to the widest young audience possible, greatly increases the chances of finding and inspiring the new Einstein. Wherever she might be.
So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”

but I've right, too, not to inhale your smoke.
First of all, health abuse is not a right;
use of right ought to lead to life, not blight.

but I've right, too, not be pained by your noise.
In short, a right can't be claimed as a right,
if it violates other people's right.”

Rather, live as if a hundred days left;

Live each day not so stressed nor so relaxed;
it's in balanced way where joy's at the max.”

It's because if godless be the ruler,
dictatorship spells hell of disaster.”

“[Writing] is a pleasure for about a week and a half. When you finish a novel, you feel triumphant, until ten days later, that is, when you have to begin thinking about the undoability of the next novel. [When I start a book I am always a beginner.] Always. Always. You can say one of the reasons that I've quit is that after fifty years I was still an amateur – a clumsy amateur lacking confidence and wholly befuddled for months and months at the beginning of every new book. Now, luckily, I remain an amateur only at the rest of life. [You don't gain any confidence little by little.] Not at the start of a book. It's a rare writer who is confident at the outset. You are just the opposite – you are doubt-ridden, steeped in uncertainty and doubt. Henry James, the great powerhouse of American fiction, the novelist's novelist – our Proust – put it perfectly while speaking, in a story of his, of the novelist's vocation. “We work in the dark – we do what we can – we give what we have. Our doubt is our passion and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art.”

“My hopes & dreams don't die. With all the suffering, I sometimes ask- Why?
They are manipulative, deceitful and they lie.
My health aint good, where do I go running away and die?

Either I hit the ground or touch the sky.
Trust me, it's ok even if each time, I cry.”

“I know that your heart is broken and I know that no words will repair that. I know how hard that is and I know it will never be the same again. But I also know what kind of person you are and how you deal with life.
My friend, love is not how many times the words "I love you" have been said and it is not the long night talks or the going outs. Those add to the value of love but those are not 'love'. A good friend can offer you those. I know, love isn't meant to be easy but knowing what to defend and what to stand for is what defines love and what defines a person you can depend on. No one should use or abuse a relationship in any way.
Knowing a person will choose you over anything else. Knowing that you can sleep safe because you have someone who will fight the world to choose you. That is Love.
So, dear friend, let him leave because you deserve someone who wants to stay and who is willing to fight for it.”
― Mohamed Eltohamy

“I have a definition of faith that is not an exact quote but it's based on scripture. When Jesus wanted to encourage faith in His disciples, He used the example of a Father providing for His children... "If your child asks you for bread you wont give him a stone and If he asks for fish you won't give him a snake. So if you as evil as you are know how to give good gifts to your children...How MUCH MORE will your father in heaven give".
Based on that expression...I've learnt that faith is to believe that God is more eager to give me what He has promised than I am more eager to receive it.”
― Kingsley Opuwari Manuel

“I've always loved life. Those who love life can never adapt, undergo, be commanded. Who loves life is always with the rifle at the window to defend life ... A human being who adapts, who suffers, who makes himself commanded, is not a human being. "

“Muddling through the chaos of her life,
She finally understood
The real among the fake.

While she kept on gripping air
In search of friends,
She finally understood where to hide.

With emptiness by her side,
She finally made friends with
Solitude and the mess of her mind.

While dialogues were only empty promises
She finally learned how to react with her cold side.

Muddling through the chaos in her life,
She finally transformed into someone,
Who just needed herself to have a sane mind.”

“In the world of so-called civilized and intelligent humans, there are only two accepted ways to see religion - one is the way of the believer, and the other is the one of the non-believer. But there is a third way - the way of the real religious person - the way of the real scientist - the way of the real yogi. It is the way where you see religion as it is, that is, an organized structure which helps people go through their daily life with as little hitch as possible. And as such, every organized structure has its pros and cons.”

Just because someone can relay information with an engaging, exciting or enticing delivery, does not mean what is being said is fact. 

Deciding what is true based on only emotion and not connecting with logic, looking up facts and researching for the proof behind it, 
can be very dangerous.

“The young, thought Sharma, have this ability to suffer much in the time of grief, unlike the old who have seen enough sorrow and know it shall not stay forever. The young hardly know grief is like a thunderstorm. It comes whispering softly at first, a distant hum, a halo of vehemence in the sky, and then there is a sudden, violent, and copious outpouring; that drenches everything that comes in its way. It darkens the sky and turns every inch of green terrain dusky grey. But they don’t realize its ferocity will become less with the lapse of time, and the sun will shine bright and warm, and wash the land golden, and no one would be able to tell there had been a storm. They scarcely understand this essential unfolding of grief isn’t meant to last forever, and eventually, it shall come to pass.”

“Try and remember what you said you'd do and why you said you'd do it.

Forget what you think other people want the thing you said you'd do to be.

The thing you said you'd do should only be what you want the thing you said you'd do to be.

If the thing you said you'd do makes other people happy, that's great but don't say things or do things just to make them happy.

Find new ways to do the thing you said you'd do that don't change the meaning of what you said you'd do.

Have the purest of intentions for what you said you'd do and do it bravely.

If the thing you said you'd do becomes successful, continue to act and think like it is unsuccessful, otherwise you'll spend your time worrying that it might become unsuccessful.

If you said you'd involve people in the thing you said you'd do, listen to them when they say what they think you should do.

If you said you'd do the thing you said you'd do alone, then go boldly into the wilderness and make your own soul be company enough, while you do the thing you said you'd do.

Do right by the thing you said you'd do. Tend to it and love it.

By trying to remember what you said you'd do and the reason why you said you'd do it.”

“Sometimes, when people have a low opinion of their own worth—or, perhaps, when they refuse responsibility for their lives—they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past. Such people don’t believe that they deserve any better—so they don’t go looking for it. Or, perhaps, they don’t want the trouble of better. Freud called this a “repetition compulsion.” He thought of it as an unconscious drive to repeat the horrors of the past—sometimes, perhaps, to formulate those horrors more precisely, sometimes to attempt more active mastery and sometimes, perhaps, because no alternatives beckon. People create their worlds with the tools they have directly at hand. Faulty tools produce faulty results. Repeated use of the same faulty tools produces the same faulty results. It is in this manner that those who fail to learn from the past doom themselves to repeat it. It’s partly fate. It’s partly inability. It’s partly … unwillingness to learn? Refusal to learn? Motivated refusal to learn?”

“What if the theories in
psychology that dominate
our mainstream culture
are flawed, rather than the
people they diagnose?
That we close our eyes
to modern brain science
and global context and
pigeonhole human beings
as “normal” or “abnormal”
is one of the biggest
shams of the century.”

“Perfect is annoying, boring,
and impossible to sustain.
Knowing how to translate
conscientiousness into

“Our old methods of excavating
for problems leaves
us with more problems.
Everything rides on changing
the positions we hold,
the questions we ask, and
the answers we’re willing
to accept. When we only
mine for weaknesses, that’s
exactly what we’ll find.”

“Being real is the power
skill of the century,
but we’re taught to be

communities, houses
of worship, and
governments.”
― Kristen Lee, Mentalligence: A New Psychology of Thinking--Learn What It Takes to be More Agile, Mindful, and Connected in Today's World

“Being a puppet
is overrated. Cut
your strings. We are
human beings, not
doings. Knowing life
is about impact, not
performance, is the
most badass kind of
clarity you can have.”
