It was an emotion that not many had the luxury of feeling without any pain attached to it. Many say that love will set you free, but I disagree.

No one would have the power to hurt me again.”

I want to disappear.”

He was here. He had come.

You merely followed the horizon where the sun set,
which became a beautiful sunrise...

Your Sunrise.....”

“Te sientes sola cuando sales con un chico, y haces el amor en su piso, y él se esfuerza por ser simpático y hacerte sentir bien, pero es como si todas sus atenciones se dirigiesen a tu cuerpo y no a tu mente (te hace el amor, te hace la cena) y sientes que cada minuto que pasas con él solo contribuye a que os canséis un poco más el uno del otro, y cuando os separáis finges que es doloroso, pero en realidad lo estás deseando porque supone un alivio dejar de esforzarte por complacer al otro, y cuando llegas a casa tientes la impresión de que él ya no ha vuelto a pensar en ti desde que saliste de la suya, tienes la sensación de que has salido de su vida para siempre, aunque sepas que al día siguiente te volverá a llamar y volverás a tener sexo con él, pero esa noche, mientras te desnudas en silencio y te metes en la cama, estás segura de que él no está pensando en ti, que nadie piensa en ti, en realidad, y también estás segura de que si descuelgas el teléfono y llamas a tu madre, a tus hermanas o a alguna de tus pocas amigas, o lo llamas a él, cualquiera de ellos se sorprenderá de ver tu número y de oír tu voz, y les llevará unos segundos hacer un hueco para acomodar tu presencia en su mundo, porque solo eres algo ajeno que entra y sale a la escena de sus vidas, algo que no deja más huella que un tenue rastro de incomodidad. La soledad es algo difícil de explicar, y si no te has sentido así jamás, enhorabuena.”

“Maybe you'll change
Abandon all your wicked ways
Make amends and start anew again
Maybe you'll see
All the wrongs you did to me
And start all over, start all over again.

Youre always been a huge piece of shit
If i could kill you i would
But it's frowned upon in all fifty states
Having said that, burn in Hell.”

Dites-lui. « Mon amour, fais comme tu voudras,
« Ton mal est un secret, je ne veux pas l’apprendre. »
Souffrez de sa blessure, en essuyant ses yeux ;
Souffrez de sa douleur sans jamais la comprendre,
Car vous ne savez pas comme on guérit les dieux,
Car vous l’aimeriez moins en le connaissant mieux.”
― Alphonse Daudet, Les Amoureuses

Your mind is roasting
Your insides are slowing
Depop around the corner

Feeding the beast and bottom feeders 
At the bank across the corner

Go drink and be merry while the world burns
And the powers that be legalize child porn...
Nothing to see folks but the sound of crickets
The American public has been so easily silenced
Good luck France and bees, and honey and trees
Your time is up as we sleep in our virtual dreams...

“To change yourself on behalf of another human being, is to truly evaporate the person that you are. You will become a shell of hollow smiles, vacant eyes and an arrested soul. Don't be the filling for someone else's cupcake. You be your own self. Be your own sweetness. Don't be the empty vessel that anybody that comes along in your life can use to change who you are. Of course, there is always room for improvement. But, we hold the hammer and chisel. And, not anyone else. Carve out the person you NEED to be. Not the person somebody may WANT you to be. In the end, you might just find that the angels above think you are swell enough, just as you are. - A.H. Scott 1/19/12

“15. In this great crush of egoism, a lot of people die.
16. Reflective neurons are reflected from the neurons of other people. When approaching danger, it’s like glowing warning road signs of fear, in the pitch darkness of self-deception. All this is an empathy of fear, that very feeling when the feeling of true friendship, love, empathy in the claws of danger intensifies.
17. The pain of awareness, as if shot from a shotgun to the knee, you feel the infernal pain of insight, you feel the bloody taste of truth in your mouth. You can shout out all fear, but you will never be able to sober up from it to the end because fear is like saliva in your mouth. You are surrounded by a sound bomb, a lethal dose of the sound of laughter of the indifference of reality that will blow up the universe of mankind, you will only have a skeleton that will someday turn into a stone of eternal memory, flesh will grow flowers, and your spirit will turn into memoirs of planet earth.

2. Cupid is a cross-eyed sniper.
3. For many people, love with late ignition.
4. If you have a broken heart, then destiny is going to offer you something better.
5. Love is the blues of sincere feelings. Something that arouses in reality something paranormal, something supernatural.
6. It is love, not friendship, which is the exact opposite of loneliness. They do not understand that everything except love is meaningless, insignificant trifles.
7. In love there is no word I, there is only a word we.
8. Do not confuse love with porn.
9. The image of a loved one is the light in the midst of darkness.
10. When love dies it is as if a person has died, the spirit comes out of his body, this spirit is a memory, a boredom, a memory. It is a life of love after parting, as if life after death. This spirit wanders in your mind, soul, and heart.
11. Love is a beautiful feeling to tears.
13. The more you love a girl, the less you want to have sex with her. You just want to embrace the soul, love the heart and kiss her lips and cheeks. Because love is higher than sex.
14. Love is stronger than fear
15. Everyone is looking for the second half: superiority, someone is a match, and few are the opposite.
16. Sympathy is a bluff, it is almost always the case. Love is a constant feeling of love, an obsession that is only intensified by mutual love. The idea of a loved one does not let you go, she is constantly in your head, and sits there very tightly.
17. Love is two magnets (a man and a woman) that attract each other more and more. Whenever you move them away from each other, the farther you go, the more powerful they are attracted to each other by body and soul. This is the most powerful magnetic force between them, and there is love.
18. When hugging a girlfriend, you need not just hug, you must convey the warmth of love that comes from your soul. What would she feel from this warm sunlight coming from your soul is the merging of souls in love with a single whole. And at this moment maybe you will feel that she presses you to her a little stronger than you her.
19. True love is like two souls merging together, like galaxies facing for centuries.
20. Let the hole in the heart let in the light of true love.
21. True love and friendship, unselfish generosity and forgiveness - these are the main manifestations of higher philosophy.
22. 1. The cause of death of love in love relationships: misunderstanding and misunderstanding.
2. The cause of death of love in marriage: life, money, character.
23. Smart chooses his life partner with the help of: brain and penis. But wise with the help of: heart and soul.
24. Cupid has poisonous arrows.
25. Release all your volley, from your flamethrower of love, into that one and only.
26. Love your beloved powerfully.
27. Lovers of exotic looks, I'm talking about love between nations and races. Such people fall in love much more sincerely and love in bed very hot and passionate rather than representatives of their people. As for most of them, for representatives of your own people, you are something trivial and trivial.
28. Goodness and love are interdimensional, multidimensional spatial forms of philosophy, out of time, this state of harmony in eternity, the key to all worlds and the inner worlds of people both external and hidden. With this vision of thinking, you see everything at once, at the same time deeply and from a height, you see all forms of time as in one palm.
29. Get up now, and forgive the loved one you love so much.
30. Love is when you give up your own egoism and accept that person in your life and you realize that you are not alone in the whole universe.

“Always try to understand what you are doing. In order for you to do it perfectly and to do it better than before.”
― De philosopher DJ Kyos

“1. Steampunk socialization of personality is a carefully controlled animatronics of logic in the human psyche, in which a cyberpunk of another’s imagination is formed.
2. To understand yourself, you just need to put a small doll in the form of a clown on your hand so as not to go crazy, and on your second hand a toy sock, do not give them alternative personalities, but make them an extension of your soul to see yourself from the outside and listen to yourself. Your alternative personalities will help you understand yourself, but do not allow personalities to multiply by budding.
3. The same life every time in a new birth, the same dream, you either become a philosopher or find yourself insane, maybe we are ghosts locked in their time and everything repeats and we are holograms of memories of us, but in any case, you in a temporary trap where you need to learn one lesson: life without sins. Oblivion here is a dead loop of memory that gives a chance to rethink everything that was in your life, erasing memory as an anesthetic and antidepressant of the psyche, but oblivion prevents you from understanding a cruel joke about yourself.
4. The aphorism of philosophy is one of the many computer codes that turns into the algorithm of power over you in the subconscious. Starting to think in your own way, you disconnect from the network of global thinking and you are considered a defective crazy person whose logic algorithms whose name is deactivated are deactivated.
5. Better than money, only their lifelong dreams govern people.
6. Awareness of the name of his will and the interaction of the race of vision, a sincere world without selfishness. The reality of humanity will finally be included in the network and telephone communications of empathy.
7. The human world is a magnificent shadow theater, which demonstrates a truly brutal show.
8. Self-hypnosis stickers peel off from your brain over time.
9. The philosophy of good and light is an acupuncture of thinking, wellness acupuncture, the direction of the flow of worldview.
10. Silence makes you dumb, vulnerable and so brilliant.
11. Sleepy paralysis of laziness in the psyche of people is parasitized by fear. Whereas dreams are the levitation of the body in reality while the person is sleeping.
12. Life is like a children's dollhouse of a princess, where the whole machine form of zombies of life is visible in the palm of your hand, in this house and home and work, you are not asked for permission, you only have the inevitability and the schedule of the intended, vicious circle of the law of meanness, repeating deja vu dream samsara’s wheels like a hamster’s wheel is like a treadmill in the gym, you run to your goals, but you run on the spot. You hold your figure, that is, your body as a voodoo doll of self-deception. There is also a secret room where disputes with oneself do not cease, there are such rooms as reality, dreams, dreams.
All life is a children's toy of higher powers, it is very similar to a hamster cage with pipes of illusions, it is a karmic cage of ironic humor about materialism. All this was created to understand a person, it is impossible to understand that until the end, because it will forever change depending on new and new accidents.
13. Any industry is a gas burner of angry motivation of the authorities.
14. Will is a shotgun as a very fantastic cosmo-blaster made of beautiful carved snow-white bones with an open jaw on the skull at the end. Weapons shooting energy of the spirit.”

The Romantic featured in Summer Romances”
― Sarah Stein, Summer Romances

“1. A question is a prayer to one's self.
2. Wars prove that the past will destroy the future.
3. The heart of darkness will bestow either holiness or madness. A voice from the depths of the gloomy loneliness of the soul will bestow an amazing observer philosophy.
4. Abstract transformations of chance prove that there is no order and will not even be in high culture.
5. The heart of reality beats in the rhythm of verses and music of beatniks, endless improvisations of opinions are like gloomy but romantic apathy of jazz - these are timid steps to the truth, as if connecting usb wires of the logic of various people, we are connected to eternity in eternal unity, we learn the common self of humanity. Exhaling cigarette smoke looking into the future with black glasses, fear that does not see terror in our eyes, he sees through glasses only courage and courage where we seem to take the last leap into the abyss of inevitability. A ray of light hits in the distance, we go to the end from dawn to dawn, snapping our fingers, we go to the climax of truth coming out of the fog of self-deception, breathing in the air of freedom from illusions, we where there are no screens of annoying instincts and other vices of self-destruction.
6. Advertising is the harshest dictator of values.
7. Accident is communication with reality.
8. Socialization is the slavery of self-deception.
9. Loneliness is music in the soul that voices feelings and emotions permeated by being. The endless quest for meaning in the impasse of fate.
Lyrical melodies in the void of consciousness, in the zone of infinite loneliness, the soul of a doomed soul to wander in the inevitability of a timeless sense of eternity. In fearless courage, the adoption of an interdimensional hybrid reality takes place that becomes one from humility.
10. All our values are in memory.
11. Patience like wine, over time you will experience the rich taste of detail.
12. Gene transformation shapes thinking and the future.
13. A lonely person is like the restless soul of reality, an ever wandering spirit in the eternal darkness of despair in the cosmic void of loneliness, meeting the dawns of the twilight of sorrow.
14. Race: smile
A race of smiles or a race called: Smile. This is my fantastic race of vision that you see in my many drawings. Their smiles as a symbol of awareness are something absolutely brilliant.
15. Forgiveness is better than eternal anger, which everyone does not care about.

5. Forgiveness is better than eternal anger, which everyone does not care about.
6. Oblivion is the insidious essence of progress.
7. Civilization is when a wild wolf becomes an obedient dog of the system.
8. Laziness is an adverse reaction to the artificial system of society.
9. Truth plunges into loneliness.
10. Atmosphere is the basis and essence of any kind of art.
11. Eternity is the funeral of logic.
12. The sound of death is a small Chinese gong of death, like the sound of a dying inevitability of the heart. Filled with a deep drama of a panting breathing in the last breaths of the air of life. It was as if they had put a bag on his head for strangulation. Like a leap into the inevitability of the emptiness of a new reality of immersion in the darkness of eternity.
13. Aliens live for millennia, thousands of life experiences. But even they don’t understand our paradoxical logic of why people still hang each other on meat hooks in memory refrigerators, which have everything from love to hate.
14. Laughter through pain and depression, like a through wound from a bullet and you feel relief. Pain will give you much more awareness and experience than pleasure.
15. A person lives too little because of the time frame of the body; there is little to understand himself, life. Problems accelerate the mind hundreds of millennia onward without consciousness and awareness, and the brain depletes itself in the false illusions of the illusory traps of the deception of the false truth of egoism.
16. Progress is an inevitability in which culture will turn into a polite formality. But because of money, this progress is slowed down because everyone makes no discoveries, almost everyone is waiting for a salary.
17. We are surrounded by anomalous thinking of rationality, and the paranormal paradoxes of egoism between the lines of everyday life.
18. The Universe is a radio and only a few have tuned their brain radio waves with this endless source of genius.

“1. Music rap beat: The creak of a door wao wao wao. Wao Wao Tum Tum Tum Wao WaoThe smashing sword of feelings cuts the emptiness of reality that feels the powerlessness of the fighter against fate

2. Music rap beat: Tuk tchak tututu tchak tutu tchak tututu tchak tutu tchak tchak tchak tutu tchak.Memory is a palace of photographs and in each room you can watch a video of memories, this palace is on fire, and new photos fly out of your head that rebuild a new castle.

3. Music rap beat: empty drum sound and beat rhythm house here tuka tu dum tuk tutu tuka house. Fake laughter as a simulated orgasm of optimism.

4. Music: Bowl Sound: woo-woo-beat rhythm: Tu-Ta-Ta-Tu-Tu-Doom Remembering, fears, desires, mysterious entities, all of them are in your hotel subconscious where you are just a doorman.

5. Compass of awareness in the hands of the one who is eating in the elevator of consciousness, awareness in the very top. On the higher floors, they will understand that they have not yet grown to logic, and where logic breaks down and the highest level of thinking begins: infinite love.

6. Thinking is life, the death of thinking and philosophy gives birth to a new form of life in a new dimension of thinking.

7. Instincts are fear, therefore we are still part of the animal world, because of fear we live in a cultural ghetto. Intuition is the courage of conscience in the heart.

8. Love is when it is pleasant to dream and think about your beloved person and to receive sincere pleasure taking care of him.

9. A philosopher is a whirling six-barreled machine gun firing thoughts, ideas into people's souls and bullets never end; a slight evil smile of awareness comes from them; everyone realizes the evil joke of reality.

10. Periodically, the light of the stairs illuminates the corridors of the staircases, everything changes and is illuminated by a beacon of good luck for our lives.

11. Insanely laughing psycheFrom disappointment, the soul cannot stop laughing with a frightening uncontrolled laugh, between fear and uncontrolled angry laughter. The smiling, insanely laughing psyche growls and tears to pieces from the high-voltage psychic tension that gives birth to truth, from a smile the philosophy of the psyche breaks into two parts of the duality of the world. A huge smile is visible in the broken mirror of the psyche, and only sometimes the image of a person is reflected in them as a reflection of conscience.

12. Everyone hurries to their graves.

13. Instincts are terrible toys of the subconscious, there is a toy world that is developed at the expense of all lived lives, they call to have fun at the expense of oneself.

“1. A time machine on the shoulders of memories, two advisers: on the right shoulder there is good future, in the left past that is evil, two open rays of time in which consciousness travels.
2. A halo of knowledge within life, this is a recording of a projection, one who feels reality can feel the universe: the past, present and future, and that which is timeless.
3. The laugh of rage
Rap beat: Trumpet music ram there beat street rhythm boo boom bang bang there tudum pub bam pa bang boom boom
The laughter of rage and the bloody gloom in a smile in consciousness from an evil joke of reality from the fact that you are not worthy to live like everyone else. The ragged strings of the ever-laughing psyche, like the blinking light of madness where there is insight between light and darkness. The interrupted melody of the harmony of the soul. The silence of insight overcomes the mind, the light is visible, leading to a new dimension of thinking, because everything is visible through the transparent eyelids of the vigilance of fear, and only unconsciousness temporarily closes our eyes from fatigue in the realm of the subconscious.
4. Gangsta music: Car sound Wooo ooo woooo oo drum beat drums pap pap pap
Laughing grin of smiling reality from the fact that billions of internal realities of people form a single reality of the hidden chaos of egoism.
5. There is nothing cheaper than sins.
7. Patience gives friends.
8. The trumpet sounds a symphony as a drawn out moan of a soul immersed in laughing horrors of reality, an amazing feeling of weightlessness of madness in the soul, a bright expressive pessimistic gloom in her smile in her laughing psyche. The poison of modern philosophy corrodes the psyche to people like acid. All in straitjackets of conservatism are wary of brilliant exotic thinking that is alien to this world created for posterity.
9. The Venereal thoughts of propaganda will decay for a very long time in the genetic thinking of the mentality.
10. The universe is mined by various bombs of philosophies from different eras. To activate them you need to read books, they act as spells from which a new world will be built for new bombs.
11. Instincts are terrible toys of the subconscious, there is a toy world that is developed at the expense of all lived lives, they call to have fun at the expense of oneself.

“1. Eternal insomnia for days on end, the brain does not rest at all. You never sleep, because you are at work all day and then you dream that you are at work, wake up in the morning, go to work. Or do you dream that you wander somewhere, in nature, in the city, run away or fight with someone, and in the morning you complain that you are not getting enough sleep. 2. All memory in the cartridge. Life as a compact cassette, the contents of the reality of the subconscious - this is the content of the same cassette tape, all the memory deja vu on the reels of the cassette representing the past and future.
3. Artifacts of experience in the memory of past lives, live with us forever in the abyss of oblivion, and some like buoys emerge and warn of the depth of unconsciousness.
4. The chain of optimism is the weak link of naivety in human evolution. Optimism from a smile for a stranglehold of reality leading to the comic surrealism of the dreaming paradoxes of the human world.
5. Love is a night lamp from gloomy thoughts of the past.
6. Genius is telepathy with eternity.
7. Expressive horror, clownish smile of shock of truth, there are so many horrors and mental sufferings in it. An evil laugh of inevitability sounds. You are in the hands of a butcher of reality. All people from different dimensions of illusions do not hide from the truth, go play.
8. You hear the shocking laugh of brutal awareness. You are in the clown horror, the smile of the reality in the form of a clown becomes gigantic and it eats you moving to the zone of eternal laughter of indifference, where you are among faceless people in chains, on them plastic masks on the floor of the face with terrible smiles of disappointment a mask of nervous laughter emanates from them souls are cremated by despair; they don’t respond to you because they are undead unscrupulous.
9. Will turns life into a lucid dream.
10. Life is a two-room apartment, where one room is a city, the other is a dream.
11. The main thing in this world is family and awareness, the rest is decor.
12. Materialism is a cell of the mind that suppresses the will of the mind.
13. Enlarged or altered parts of the body are prostheses of pride, a disabled ego, you can see how the brain looks, but not the soul, a mutated mind exhausted by knowledge.
14. For a single person, the heart will become a friend, the body will be the soul, and the mind will become a horse.
15. Pride will take away the truth from the world without which there will be no future only spiritual poverty.
16. A frightening schizoid, bloody smile of rage burns with fire several hundred meters. Tearing the face and psyche and the skull itself, a delightful light smile of insensibility.
17. Time will show a complete psychological portrait of mankind to light and darkness.
18. Faith is stronger than all torture; there is nothing more powerful in the whole universe than faith that feeds will.
19. Truth - these are very strongly tightened strings, you need to play them very carefully and then you will hear an unforgettable melody of truth that may turn out to be the last in your life.
20. Reality is decomposing and all the ridiculous horrors of reality are visible, since you are in the lush chronosphere, where the quantum genetic transformations of the instincts of despair are in, in the projection of an alternative reality of the ego of power in which everything is programmed for decomposition.
21. An alternative is all that you have left.
22. Around you are bodypainting instincts of despair, a reflection of naked and at the same time false inner sensations and complexes.
23. Laughter and a frozen smile with tears is a state of doom that says that there is no more hope. Such laughter is heard in society, it is increasingly painful to look at the schizoid smiles of selfishness, under large bandanas in the form of eerie toothy smiles. You laugh until your heart stops.

If it is directed at you from people: resentment, envy, acrimony, sarcasm, anger, aggression, hatred, revenge, rage - know that all this is people's sympathy, this does not mean that you are a bad person, just very attractive personality.

Let the whole world sing your virtues.

Greatness also falls short.
You dare to do so much,
Bend the sword of the brave warrior also.
You become so true
Your name should be taken after Harishchandra.”

We are too quick to ruin someone's life and bring others down. We are too quick to insult others and cyber bully them. We are not afraid to lie just to destroy others image or reputation. We are doing everything for clout, even it means destroying everyone's happiness and life. We promote hate and division .

We rejoice when others fail, lose their jobs, lose what they worked hard for or accomplished. When they divorce or go through hard times or heartbreak. We laugh when others are not making it in life and are experiencing pain. We do all this In the name of poverty, that we are also suffering. I just hope you will chose to differ.

“The Moth and Its Beloved

Ask the moth the beauty of the candle
And it will burn without a confession
There is a secret to its longing
For it feels no fear or hesitation

The moth is too much in love with the flame Yet it does not appear under the sun
For the moon’s light is far too feeble, and
It gave up on its pursuit of the sun

Just a sight of a candle is enough
To remind it of its real beloved
So it settles for that candle in reach,
Revels in its heat, and asks to be burned”
― Zubair Ahsan, Of Endeavours Blue

― De philosopher DJ Kyos

“where am I going? This society? The whole human race?” These are questions which many of us today are asking urgently, deeply troubled about what we see happening in our world Our concerns may be quite personal ones, centered around our own particular life situation. They may be general ones, related to the state of things as a whole or both. For this is a strange and difficult time, a time when all the old values and traditions seem to have been cut out from under us without anything clear and definitive having been substituted for them. From every direction and every possible source, we’re being bombarded by the newfangled ideas, values and behaviors of the New Age in which we live.

The New Age is an age with many interesting features. One of these is confusion. Great numbers of us no longer seem to have a clear sense of right and wrong, good and bad. Under the impact of too much personal freedom and the flood of new ideas and values, we’re falling apart, frightened, uncertain, lost. After all, how is it possible to have certainty about anything when even the most basic, time-honored values are being called into question?

In comparison to earlier times, everything around us today seems upside-down and backwards. A great deal of what was previously considered right is now looked upon as outmoded, irrelevant or just plain dumb. At the same time, much of what used to be considered wrong is now accepted as right, normal and okay. Members of the older generation, like myself, still maintain our vision of what things were like in an earlier, simpler, less perplexing period. But when our generation goes, apart from people of strong religious faith, who will be left that still retains a clear vision of a saner, more stable society? That vision will have gone with the winds of change.

This turn-about in basic human values and morals has led to a steady unraveling of civilized standards and behavior, not only in the country but worldwide. Brutality, lust and all manner of other evils flourish around the globe; violence, vice and exploitation seem to have become the new order of the day. And fear hangs over the whole world. Those of us who are even slightly sensitive to the currents and energies around us realize that something is wrong-deeply, awfully wrong. And we carry the collective burden of humanity’s pain and turmoil deep within our hearts.

Day by day the fear and uneasiness increases. Often we sense that we’re at the edge of a terrible and dangerous abyss, surrounded by intense darkness. As the end of this millennium approaches, predictions of a worldwide Armageddon-like catastrophe haunt our minds. And how can it be otherwise when we sense deep within ourselves that things have gone so wrong that such a crisis is due? For each day, new and deeper holes appear in the social and moral fabric of mankind, and it seem obvious that when the holes become more than the fabric itself, it’s past repair.”

Written by an American Muslim, this work presents a brief yet comprehensive survey of the basic teachings on the significance of Islam's central concept, faith in and submission to God. It introduces the reader to how Muslims feel about various aspects of life, how they worship, and how Muslims living in the West practice their religion. Perhaps you have been hearing a lot about Islam and Muslims in the news and are interested in knowing, justifiably, just what this religion is all about. This is the classic English-language book for introducing Islam to non-Muslims in the West. It is a well-balanced book that does an excellent job of covering the basics of belief, practice, and culture, without overwhelming the reader in minutia. This is generally the first book that I recommend to people who are interested in learning about Islam.

“I rebuke myself for celebrating freedom day, while I am still afraid to live my life and to do what I want , because of I am afraid of what people will say. Not only that but If I am still enslaved by culture, tradition, Christianity, believes, desires, internet and social media. I live in fear ,because of crime . The truth is I don’t know what is like to be free .”

“After you give yourself the chance to get to know yourself, love on yourself, and finally put yourself first, you’ll be like a kid in the candy store, because your life is so sweet. This is because you’ve accepted your flaws, you’ve learned how to say no without regret, you’re giving yourself so much attention and are loving yourself to the moon and back.
You are in your ‘Ahah’ moment, and goodness gracious, you are in the zone where nobody can interrupt your inner peace. As others’ houses of cards fall down, you press forward because that isn’t your problem. You are taking happy steps, your mind is on cruise control, and you’ve created a new and improved plan for your life. Life is good!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“If women work together instead of trying to hurt or compete against each other, we most definitely will be a powerful force. We have to be open-minded and realize that if we come together and do the unexpected, everything will work together for good. Not only will it work together for good but we will be strong warriors from the side effects that tried to weaken our inner peace of mind.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A powerful force of women does not have a race or religion. We are human—a powerful human force!”

“You’re in the process of learning who you are, and you are loving every step. You’ve moved past needing the approval of others. The counterfeit emotions you once had from their judgment has burned away in the fire.
You are the author of your story, you are the narrative, and you choose to live and enjoy life!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“If we, as women, embrace each other we will be unstoppable. We must stand together and be counted as one.
As one we are strong.
As one we are tough.
As one we can challenge what the future holds.
As one we are survivors.
As one we have unbelievable courage.
As one we can face any obstacle.
As one we are centered and balanced.
As one we will transform the world.
As one we are pioneers and trailblazers.
As one our opportunities are endless.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Our roots run deep and are strong to the core.
I am proud to see women taking a stand. Many times, we have been fallen warriors; there have been plenty of times we have been wounded warriors, but we are still standing. We are standing up for our rights. We are standing up for a cause. We are standing up for movements that empower us to be heard, respected and appreciated!
We are bold!
We are courageous!
We are thankful!
We are grateful!
We are blessed!”

“Here and now, you are making a vow to love yourself wholeheartedly. Self-fulfillment is your outer and inner peace. You are loving the change in the wind. You have a sound mind.

― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Happiness is never giving up on your dreams. They told me that I would never get to tell my story but I am stronger than I knew. Their voices were poison. I wasn’t going to let them steal my joy. There was no way in hell I was going to let them write my beginning or ending. The chapters in my life are going to be told by the person who lived it, and that’s me.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Your story has changed from disappointment to achievement. You’ve changed the script to love yourself, therefore, love, love, and love yourself more. Accumulate self-love; raise your expectations; value your characteristics, and most importantly, love yourself wholeheartedly
Happiness is precious.
Happiness is courage.
Happiness is patience.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“No, you are not perfect. What’s important is that you know your self-worth and you are happy, and that’s all that matters. You now know that you should never underestimate your ability to create your own happiness.

“We are Trailblazers!
Our Shero’s used their brains to spark the flame.
We, as women, have to learn we cannot always do everything alone; coming together as one produces greatness as we lay the foundation together.
All women are Trailblazers who’ve put in the work, and as we all know, nothing comes easy. Therefore, the time and hard work we’ve invested is ours that we earned; because it most definitely wasn’t given.
Trailblazers, we must own our lives, filter out what doesn’t serve us, and stand firm for what we believe in.
Our voices are beautiful and powerful!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“When a woman is passive, it is acceptable. However, when a woman speaks her mind and voices her opinion, that is a serious problem. A woman’s voice should count, but sadly, when a woman speaks, people hear only what they want to hear; the rest falls on deaf ears. When things do not work out as planned, a woman has to step up to the plate to fix the problem that she had a solution for in the first place.”

“Groundbreaker! Stomp the ground and make your mark.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Trailblazer, you are a warrior!
Other people’s actions gave you a head start because you recognized the red flags and knew that wasn’t the right way to go. The force of awareness broadened your vision; you had the keen insight of an eagle. You knew when to soar in the sky with ease and peace. You also knew when to suit up as you looked down and hunted for your prey. The best part of it all was, just as they thought they’d got the best of you, you attacked at the right time, and they never saw it coming.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Trailblazer, you are a warrior! At times, are you underestimated? There were so many sacrifices you made, and afterward, you felt like pure shit. The resentment pulled and spread like mold, and the mold’s side effects made you sick and disgusted from loving so hard and losing so much. The ripple effects crossed each other as they manipulated your mind to think negative thoughts. However, the ripple effects also opened your heart to feel and know how to love yourself. As you started your journey of self-fulfillment, all the hell you’ve been through changed you from a fallen warrior into a fearless powerful force with fabulous potential!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“We have to take up the cross that was left by our Pioneers; they got us as far as they could. It is now our time to take advantage of the tools that were left for us and open the doors of our opportunities as women. We have to lead by example for our little girls and young ladies who will soon take up the torch. We have to show them by our actions that women’s opportunities are never-ending. Their assumptions must not take us off-course because our minds are too sharp and powerful to dwell on their insecurities, and we do not have time to stray off track.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Our Pioneers and Trailblazers who dared to make the journey into the unknown have given us the courage to break out of our comfort zone to dare to be unique, magnificent, phenomenal; and have set ideals to stand for the power of truth.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Our pioneers gave us a head start. They prepared us to fight many battles for decades to come as they left the map for us to continue on the path of their greatness. As quoted by the great Susan B. Anthony, “Oh, if I could but live another century and see the fruition of all the work for women! There is so much yet to be done.”
The shade of our skin might be a bit darker or lighter, but we share the same rejections and discriminations as we are treated unfairly because we are women. Our religions might very well be different; however, we share the same identity, being females productively working for change for a greater cause.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Our minds are creative and knowledgeable.
Yet time and time again, our needs and wants fell on deaf ears. We were told we weren’t good enough. We were abused mentally, physically, and emotionally. We were told with nasty sarcastic remarks at times, and here and there maybe a laugh that made the insult worse; “It would be your word against mine, and guess who they are going believe? Not you.”
One by one we took a chance to speak up, but our voices weren’t heard. They tried to make us feel threatened; as if we were going to lay down and be stepped on like shit on the bottom on their shoe. We interrupted their comfort zone and showed them their time was up!
Their time of talking and belittling us this way has expired. They tried, but they failed to realize we are strong and we will never give up.
Their time of thinking they can touch us inappropriately and we will keep quiet has expired. No! We will rise up and bring the world to its feet. Trust me… We will be seen and heard!
Their time of trying to break us down has expired. No! We can move mountains!
Their time of pointing their fingers at us and putting F.E.A.R (False Evidence Appearing Real) into our minds by making us believe it is our fault has expired. No! It is not our fault. It never was!
Their time of nasty insults has expired. They fail to realize we catch every nasty word and throw back the insult to show we can give as good as we get.
Their time of preying off vulnerable women who have to “make a deal” to get a higher position they earned has expired. No! Your “man”ipulation has no effect. We, as women, have full ownership of our minds, bodies, and souls.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“As women, we have come a long way but the struggle is real and our hunger is stirring up the right to be treated equally regardless of age, religion, race, and or which “group” we belong to. There is so much more that needs to be done but if we continue to come together as women instead of being each other’s enemies, filled with the rage of envy and competition, we will be able to move further along a lot faster than expected.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Embrace your individuality by embracing your authentic self. Go deeper to develop a relationship with yourself. Accept who you are; because self-love requires discipline. Create a life that you know is yours—the key to a better you is perseverance.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“There were many pioneers who came before you that also felt a sense of hopelessness. They were judged because they were women. At times they felt helpless but that didn’t stop them from making their mark as they made changes in the world which people thought were impossible. They made themselves into believers because of their accomplishments.
These pioneers did not have the technology and resources that we have today. However, they used what they were given, which was their God-given talent. “We will be heard, seen, and are untouchable.” The pioneer’s voices were rising louder, stronger, and their voices were heard as they made the impossible, possible.
Their mentality was, “We will not be ignored. We are human and we should be created equally, just like men.” As they rose to the challenges they endured, their great strength of determination spoke without the need for words.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“We have to realize that we are a powerful force. If we work together, we can make a huge difference in the world, despite our race or religion. If we, as women, dare to come together we can help each other conquer our fears. We can help each other become wiser by teaching and learning from each other.
We need to lift each other up more. Reach down to lend a helping hand. Reach up and tell your sisters of all races and religions, “I am here for you.”
After all of the sacrifices we’ve made for others, surely, we can make sacrifices for each other. As much as we women have loved (and most definitely lost) due to heartbreak, being unappreciated, and working hard on a daily basis, why do we put each other down? Why do we use each other? What is the point in competing? Don’t we have enough going against us as it is? We should be able to come together and love one another. We should be able to help each other recover from our losses. That is what I call a powerful force.”

“When a woman is independent, that’s also a huge issue. I have noticed that an independent woman is spoken down to because she is fearless, free, and she would rather walk alone because she knows her worth. Ladies, there is nothing wrong with that!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“It is time to stop a young woman from being manipulated to break her ass and tear herself down to the core in order to build a man up. Once she builds him up, more than half the time he leaves her to figure out the million-piece puzzle of life. Wow! It never amazes me how men forget who was there for them when they didn’t have a damn thing to their name. It’s a timeout for that!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, Unapologetic for My Flaws and All

“Discipline is key when you’re working on self-fulfillment. Therefore, you must stay on course. Success is an ‘inside job’ because it starts with working on yourself first before you can reap any benefits.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“You are claiming what is yours, and that is a prosperous life. A prosperous life of peace, joy, love, happiness, inspiration, creativity, hope and guidance. Although it was taken from you because you were brainwashed to put others first, you have found your birthright. Having a prosperous life has always been your birthright!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“It’s time to stop allowing people to blame the woman for everything. As women, we try to figure out what they need, what they want; and the entire time we’re stressing ourselves out and they don’t give a shit as long as it’s done. Hell, no. Timeout for that too! We do not give a rat’s ass anymore—they are quick to blame us for their mess-ups and think we are supposed to make magic happen. It is time to let them deal with it and figure out how they are going to mend their shit. If they want to blame us, let them, who cares? Their shit isn’t our problem.
Go ahead, blame the women. We are holding up the peace sign, smiling and laughing, feeling good as we press forward!
We are free and feel refreshed. It feels good to be the last ones standing. We look at life totally differently, and we now see that it’s okay to be a little rough around the edges.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“The dots are now connecting. You feel alive!
You know now that all is not lost. Now that you’ve cut the cord it is time give your heart a second chance at loving yourself.
Silence your mind. Take a deep breath and close your eyes. As you open your eyes, look at your reflection in the mirror. Aren’t you beautiful, Queen? Embrace who you are. Smile, laugh, welcome the new you and say, “My world is just now beginning.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“You’ve lost a lot, but you’ve gained closure. You are now balanced, centered, focused, and filled with peace surrounding you in your heart, mind, body, and soul.
Your pride was hurt, but you would rather walk alone and be more willing to give and learn more about the queen you are.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“You might not see it now, but you are stronger than you can ever imagine.
You cannot become comfortable in your pain. You have to let the pain that you feel turn you into a rose without thorns. There are sixteen pieces on the chess board. The king is the most important piece, but the difference is that the queen is the most powerful piece!
You are a queen, you can maneuver around your opponents; they do not have the power over your life, your mind or soul. You might think you’ve been a prisoner, but that is your past’ Look in the now and work your way to how you want your future to be. Exercise your thoughts into a pattern of letting go, and think positively about more of what you want than what you do not want.
Queen!
You are a queen! As a matter of fact, you are the queen! Act as if you know it!
You are powerful, determined, strong, and you can make the biggest and most extravagant move and put it into action.
Lights, camera, strike a pose and own it!
It is yours to own!”

“It is time to stop molding our girls to please others. It is time to stop teaching our girls that they should bend over backwards to make a man feel good about himself. A woman shouldn’t ever have to belittle herself to make a man feel as though he is being the man.”

“My character was tested because I didn’t think I would have to compromise so much of who I was as a person. I changed so much because I gave so much of me and lost myself in the process. Sadly, when I lost myself, I did not notice. It just happened; it was more of a habit I formed to adjust. I was damaged from the inside out because my life wasn’t mine anymore. I was someone I had to be; not who I wanted to be. I wasn’t someone that made “me” happy. I made everyone else happy, and it wasn’t enough.

Losing yourself is scary.”
― Charlena E. Jackson

“A young lady is taught to never fuss or complain, and to always keep a smile on her face. When a young lady speaks her mind, she is labeled as being impolite and is told to be cautious and mindful of what she says. Something to think about...”

“We accumulate other’s people debts and make them our own. As we make them our own, their responsibilities fall solely on us. Now is the time to transfer their debt back into their account and let them figure out how they going to pay off their own debt. We, as women, need to realize we are not responsible for other people’s debts, only our own, and we will finally see the load will be a lot lighter. We have to stop making life easy for other people. We give them life, yet they take life from us. We want to live, and it starts with self-fulfillment!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“You lost yourself in the process, but the more you learn about the new you, the more you will be so much in love with yourself. The more you learn about the new you, the more you will know your worth. The more you learn about the new you, the happier you are going to be, and this time around you will be smiling inside and out!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“The ripple effect is change. Eventually, the rings of the ripples change; they either become smaller or wider in length. No matter the size, sooner or later, the ripple will vanish, but the question is—did it leave an effect or was it pointless?
What impact does the ripple effect have on you? Will you reach for great heights, or will you let the ripple effect’s “purpose” pass you by?”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A young lady is supposed to be classy, kind, generous, and respectful. She is told she should not display any anger and/or badmouth her peers. A young lady is told to think ‘inside the box’ and to limit her expectations because her husband will provide for her in the future.
A young lady is taught to never fuss or complain and to always keep a smile on her face. When a young lady speaks her mind, she is told that she is not acting “ladylike”.
When a young lady steps out of her comfort zone to challenge herself to fight for what she wants, she is told she is not acting “ladylike”.
When a young lady plays a sport, and at times she may be aggressive, she is told that she is not acting “ladylike”
When a young lady is bossy, she is told to humble herself, because that is not acting “ladylike”. Maybe she isn’t bossy, maybe she is confident within herself, has high self-esteem and knows she can dare to be different.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“When a young lady no longer plays with baby dolls or toy kitchens, and she’s trying to find where she fits in today’s society, she is told she needs to learn how to cook, clean, wash, and provide for her husband and family. Why is that so?”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“When I’d had enough of my kindness being taken for weakness, I felt like I was floating in the ocean. People’s actions toward me were like the crashing of the waves. Their words and actions were like tides that took me further and deeper into the deep. I didn’t have anything to hold on to but the flow of the water kept me afloat. When the tides took me further out, I floated on my back and went with the flow. The water became my friend as it taught me not to panic in trying times.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“The full impact of the ripple effect can at times be unpredictable, but it is what you make of it. It doesn’t matter how many stones have been thrown at you because you are the master of your actions. How you view the ripple effect’s rings will determine your outcome. Will you let them break you or will you use them to the fullest potential?”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Yes, you loved, and loved so much. You also lost as well, but you lost hurt, pain, agony, and confusion. You’ve lost interest in wanting to know answers to unanswered questions. You’ve lost the willingness to give a shit about what others think. You’ve surrendered to being fine, that you cannot change the things you have no control over.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“I decided to choose:
No more sadness because of how someone else will feel.
No more hiding my feelings.
No more avoiding the truth of how I felt.
No more unresolved situations.
No more letting people rob me of my happiness and joy and letting life pass me by.
No more misery and selling myself short.
No more letting people take and steal my inner peace.
No more giving a shit about what other people think of me—they are going to form their opinion anyway—and the question is, who cares? Not me. That’s the least of my worries.
No more giving everyone the best of me. It is time for me to fall in love with myself and give myself ALL of me!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“During one of my biggest struggles, the ripple effect was at its worst. I felt as though the ripple was going to turn into a whirlpool – to the point where I thought I was going to drown. My head was under the water and my hands were reaching for something to hold on to. Sadly, there wasn’t anyone or anything I could take hold of. However, when I trusted the waves, they carried me to a peaceful place in my mind, to the hidden aspects of my true self where I could explore my options. I had to find comfort in what was given and make the best of it.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Instead of being groomed for her future husband and/or career, a young lady should be first taught to love herself. I am a firm believer that if you put yourself first and find out who you are as a person, everything else will fall into place.
Sadly, that is not what a young lady is taught.
We are taught to love others and to put everyone’s needs before our own. We are taught to make sacrifices at an early age to the point where we do not know any better as we age. The edges of our life are rough because we do not know who we are as a person.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, Unapologetic for My Flaws and All

“After we become a daughter, we become a wife to our husbands and a mother to our children. I believe that is why a woman smiles through the pain because she was always told what she couldn’t or shouldn’t do. Regardless of this, she believed in herself and made it happen.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A woman lives under pressure on a daily basis. Nearly every day a woman is being criticized for the way she looks, thinks, acts, how she raises her children and her role in the workplace. She is criticized by other women, her husband and/or significant other, her children, family, and friends. Goodness gracious, when will a woman’s love ever be good enough?
She's constantly beaten down by being told what she’s doing wrong, and barely hears what she has done right. Needless to say, she isn’t praised for her accomplishments; often, all she hears is criticism. I would love to see the detractors walk in her shoes for a while.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Most importantly, a little girl should be taught that she should love herself first, flaws (thorns) and all. However, she’s been raised as a rose without knowing how to handle the pricks from the thorns. She’s left alone to learn how to heal.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, Unapologetic for My Flaws and All

“The young lady was once a rose without thorns because she was taught how to take care of everyone else, as opposed to taking care of herself. After the betrayals, hurt, pain and bitterness, she becomes a rose with thorns. However, the thorns pricked and scared her, because she was groomed to be what other people wanted her to be. Now she has to learn how to handle the thorns of life on her own.
As the thorns grow thicker and sharper, her personality changes; she is now labeled as bitter, quick-tempered, and a bad influence on others because her attitude has changed. Sad to say, the same people who molded her to be the “perfect” young lady, are the ones who are back-biting her. They fail to realize it was their doing. Everyone should be born with thorns so that they are entitled to make mistakes and learn from them. They will know how it feels to love, to be loved, and to know how to heal if love doesn’t work out accordingly.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Why can’t a young lady, learn how to cook, clean and wash clothes so she can learn how to take care of herself? It is imperative that a young lady should know how to love and take care of herself first before she feels she can love and take care of anyone else.
That is where the mistakes begin. A young lady is brought up to put others first. This is when a woman grows up and plays the fool for others because her self-worth was never built on solid ground. Instead, it was built on being a “people pleaser” and putting her life on the back burner.
Consequently, her feelings didn’t matter, and her thoughts didn’t exist because for so long she was taught to put other people before herself. The question that is never asked is, what happens when a woman (who was once a young lady groomed to give every ounce of herself) loses herself to the point where she has to find a way to dig herself out of the deepest hole? This seems impossible. She doesn’t know how because she wasn’t ever taught how to express her feelings, troubles, and/or grieve.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“As they throw more stones, let them fall where they may. In my opinion, the more rings in the ripple effect the better! Needless to say, they are giving you the opportunity to exchange their hate, backbiting, and negative energy into valuing and loving yourself more. They are helping you create a thicker skin as you find your happiness and you embrace a fruitful future.
This is your moment. You are coming into a time of peace and fulfillment. Take it all in! You put up with a lot of people’s shit to get where you are today.”

“However, the love you gave wasn’t in vain; it helped you to become a better person. The loss opened your eyes to see that you deserve so much better. It is alright to cry. You are finding your strength and you are beginning to find the voice within. You are special. You are unique. You are loved. There’s no need to be afraid. Life is a journey! You will make it. It’s okay to let go of the loss and count it all pure joy!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Everything has changed and life has taken a turn for the worse. Side effects are making you sick. Sick of life. Sick of struggling.
The side effects take a toll on you. You feel yourself trembling, and it is unbearable to breathe and think about what’s next. You begin to slip into the deep end and feel numb. Your thoughts drift as the side effects get closer and closer to the point that you want to give up. The more and more they pull you underneath you can’t help but think, I do not have any fight left in me.
Wake-up call! You have a lot to lose. You have more fight in you than you ever knew. You didn’t give yourself the opportunity to love yourself. You didn’t give yourself the ability to live and love life. You have given so much to others. Imagine, if you gave to yourself what you’ve given to others, what life would be like. Do not get lost in the deep end. You have to live for the now. Believe it or not, everything will fall into place. It doesn’t look like it at the moment, but better days lie ahead.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“When the side effects knock you down, find the strength to get up, because you are a soldier. You’ve paid your dues, and nobody can hurt you because your foundation is solid.
You are not broken down anymore. The Grim Reaper cannot steal your joy. You are no longer its victim. You are victorious, feeling good and living free! The ‘treatment’ gave you a turbocharge to find a cure. The cure is to love yourself more and to put yourself first.”
― Charlena E. Jackson

“You do not have to accept the approval of others. Honestly, who gives a shit, because their lives are messed up, too. They are always going to judge because they are keeping an eye on your accomplishments. Therefore, they are always going to have something to talk about because you are doing something right.
You look at your life and ask, why are they so jealous; I do not have anything they want. Oh, yes ma’am you have everything they want. And it starts with who you are as a person. They want to be you.
They want your strength.
They want your courage.
They want your confidence.
They want your stride.
And they want your joy.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A woman is mistreated and disrespected on so many levels, yet she is the one who makes the curves in the road straight. She is the one who smoothes the bumpy road. When a woman loves; she loves hard, and when she loves hard, she loves deeply from within the core of her soul. Yet, she is never appreciated.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A woman is always being taken advantage of in so many situations. To add insult to injury, people always try to belittle a woman—as if her opinion doesn’t matter—and people feel that they can manipulate a woman as if she’s naïve and clueless. Other people will steal a woman’s idea as if they came up with it on their own. It makes my skin crawl when a woman is told to step aside and keep quiet as if her voice doesn’t deserve to be heard, and we all know that women don’t receive as many opportunities as their male counterparts. However, opportunities are endless, and when a woman is given a chance, she makes it a personal mission to execute by always being the seeker and observer.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Don’t bury yourself in broken dreams of resentment. Expand your life purpose and reap the benefit of happiness!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“The side effects of others become a hazard because this sucks the life out of you, and you begin to neglect yourself, but they do not care. As long as you are doing for them and supplying their needs, they are fine. Their faces are the same on a daily basis, but the person you do not recognize is yourself. Their side effects begin to make you sick, yet you ignore the signs. The warning signs have been there for years, but again, you push yourself because you feel like someday soon you will finally make them happy.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“When it rains, it pours but that isn’t a bad thing. Take advantage of the rain as it washes away all of the residues that the side effects left behind. As you confront your side effects, walk with pride, do not turn back, face them head-on. Nothing can faze you now because the rain is clearing your path. After the rain has washed away the side effects, their powers are watered down. Therefore, they can no longer interrupt your peace, kill your joy or steal your happiness.
The side effects’ time has expired. It is time to put an end once and for all to carrying everyone’s dirty load. Leave them where they lie. Let them figure out their own messes and bad decisions.
Take a breather and let it go. I bet the load is so much lighter!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Not only do you carry the side effects of others, but their side effects are contagious. This affects you mentally to the point where you lose yourself in the process of trying to fix a situation or a person that is beyond repair.
You find yourself helping others who solely depend on you for their mental state and their ability to think for themselves. Foolishly, you do not see how often you carry their burdens. Their side effects begin to poison your life.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“You have to realize it is impossible to be the shero to everyone. There comes a time when you have to make a difficult decision to say no to the ones you love. If not, you will be fighting a never-ending battle that you will lose every time. Sad but true, you have to be cruel to be kind, otherwise, you will be defeated.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Each sacrifice was a process of change. Your tears changed your perception and they cleansed your soul. Those were survival tears. As you were changing, slowly but surely you were forming a connection as you began to think and analyze—this isn’t your life. This isn’t you.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“This transformation helped me to become productive and my mindset became focused on change for the better. My identity was the essence of me, and the path without fear was ahead of me as I walked, knowing that happiness, grace, joy, and love were my birthright!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Education is very important. The more education a woman has the more she is looked down upon. Nothing comes easy for a woman, and that is why she is tough. She has to earn everything she works hard for—that’s fine, and honestly, it isn’t an issue. Hard work grooms a woman to be a powerful force.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“One might say, it’s easier said than done. Of course, I have been down that road as well. I agree one hundred percent that it’s so much easier said than done. I am very much aware that life sometimes is like tossing a coin in the air calling heads or tails, but it doesn’t matter what side it lands on; life goes on.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Another one bites the dust. I am reaping the benefit of self-fulfillment and self-control. I am worthy of all the good things in life.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Take the healing that is being offered. Untangle your fears. Confidence and perseverance are your purpose.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“You’ve learned that when it comes to some people, nothing would ever good enough. You have to be willing to accept that you loved them to the best of your ability, and only lost someone who caused you to lose more of yourself. Those people aren’t worth saving because the question is, who will save you?”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Dear Fallen Warrior, you will not fall apart. Not all wars are meant to have weapons. Your armor is your mind, peace, happiness, drive–and your life. You are powerful! You are unique! You are a warrior because you are the chosen one!!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“It is important to keep one foot in front of the other. As a woman, you have to fake it until you make it. There will be a lot of twists and turns. There will mountains that are steep and seem to be too high to climb. However, where there’s a will, there’s a way. Giving up isn’t an option.
Never-ending obstacles pile up one after another. The process seems to repeat itself over and over again without a solution. You’ve been here before. Where does it end? When does it end? Things seem to stay the same or they become worse than before. How many times do you have to compromise? You cannot continue to carry everyone’s burdens and their side effects as if everything is just fine”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“You take a step; rocks and dust fall off the cliff. You stumble and you move forward. The voices in your head call you a coward. You are beginning to second-guess yourself because you want to throw in the towel. You close your eyes; a tear falls and travels to your chin. As your eyes are closed the Great Divine’s voice is louder; yet, calmer, soothing; and you feel peace instantly. Your mind feels light, and your body feels balanced. The Great Divine whispers gently and softly in your ear:
“Fallen Warrior, I know you have given everything you’ve got, and you feel like you have nothing left to give.
Fallen Warrior, I know it’s been a while since you smiled.
Fallen Warrior, I see that you are hurting, and I feel your pain.
Fallen Warrior, this is not the end. This is the start of your new beginning.
Fallen Warrior, do not doubt My or your abilities; you have more going for you than you have going against you.
Fallen Warrior, keep moving, you have what it takes; perseverance is your middle name.
Fallen Warrior, you are not the victim! You are the victor!
You step back because you know why you are here. You know why you are alive. Sometimes you have to be your own Shero.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“No longer was I consumed by being a prisoner in my mind. I was not willing to give in to the cards I was dealt. I took my power back and I had control of the cards, and as I held the cards in my hand, I shuffled them to my liking. I knew I wasn’t always going have the best hand every single time, but I knew I had the power to shuffle when I needed to reexamine my hand.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Slowly but surely, I let the happiness back into my life. There were times when I psyched myself out and let happiness play peek-a-boo as I let despair, pain, hurt, stress and depression back into my life.
When I had to start from ground zero, I didn’t think I was going to make it. I was a fallen warrior who didn’t have any armor for protection. All of my weapons of bravery, peace, sanity, and joy were stolen from me. I was abandoned without any protection from the world”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“It is okay to cry survival tears. In difficult times, it is okay to ask questions. It is hard to let go and have faith; therefore, you are always asking, Why me? What did I do wrong? Should I have given more of this or that? Or, what if?
Stop.
Pause.
If you start to overthink, you start thinking wrong. Calm your mind and know, Fallen Warrior, this is not your fault. Questions are overflowing in your mind as you rob yourself of happiness, and you cannot catch your breath because fear is giving you an earful of lies. You must kill the lies by choosing to be happy. Happiness goes a long way. Bring back the flow of happiness.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“When someone hurts your pride, do not allow them to force you to run away or lose hope. They want you to struggle, they want you to feel like you are suffocating, and they want you to feel like you cannot go on. Let go of wasted negative energy and fear —you are only human and you cannot please everyone at the same time. Remember, nobody can take your inner peace unless you allow them to.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“As a fallen warrior, you feel like nothing has been going your way lately, and that you do not have any fight left. Do not dwell on the past or what is thrown at you; instead, use it as fuel to be a powerful fighter! As you become a powerful fighter, learn how to balance and focus on your inner peace. Keep a steady, positive mind and remind yourself that nobody has the power or authority to bring you down.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“You’ve lived and learned that timing is everything. Time is precious. Your birthright is happiness, love, peace, and joy. As you travel the road of life, you now know when to pay attention. You now know your worth, and as you walk down the path without fear, you are learning more and more about yourself than you have ever known. No matter how old you are—you are learning the fundamentals of life forces that will help guide you along the way. You are learning that there’s no need for a flashlight because the love you have for yourself is shining so brightly that everyone notices as you walk past them.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Tell yourself, I know why I am here. I know why I am alive. Be honest with yourself and be open to how you want your life to feel. Feeling new, refreshed and learning how to love again. You deserve to smile.
All the pain was wearing you down. The battles left you shattered and broken. There were times you were stumbling, but you didn’t fall. Each tear you cried brought you to this moment. Your scars gave you strength to heal, and they taught you how to love and appreciate yourself.
You rose above it all!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Change gives you the courage to look at your past without any regrets. Change says your past made you stronger and wiser and is getting you ready to emerge from hibernation. It is preparing you to never comprise your self-worth and to take everything at face value. Take a breather. Don’t underestimate your ability to create your own happiness. Your journey starts when you begin to love (Y.O.U.) Yourself. Over. Unhappiness.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“As a woman, you walk into all kinds of unknown situations that cause you to fall in love, put someone else’s needs before your own, and make unbelievable sacrifices. As time goes by, falling in love has its consequences. You fall in love with your mate, children, family, and job. However, you do not receive a fraction of what you have given in return. Sadly, nobody sees you are beyond exhausted. They want you to go, go and go without complaining.
If they carefully pay attention and think about it; when was the last time they saw you smile, truly smile? When was the last time they saw you happy, truly happy? When was the last time they offered to help you, as opposed to asking could you do this or that? When was the last time they gave you a moment to breathe?”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Fallen warriors, you might fall, but you are like eagles! You work effortlessly as you soar high into the clouds. You ride the winds of change as you gather all of your strength, courage, and patience. You develop wisdom during your challenges of transformation while you tear down your boundaries one obstacle at a time.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Children fail to realize that a mother doesn’t have to provide their “wants”. Her bags are heavy because they are filled by everyone’s “wants”. There isn’t one “want” in the bags a mother is carrying that belongs to her. She looks past her self-fulfillment. She feels as though her wants and needs are not important; therefore, they are never on the list.
Children cannot see past their selfish ways. By law, a parent is supposed to provide shelter, food, clothing, make sure their children attend schools and have their annual health checkups. A mother isn’t required to put her children in extracurricular activities; that is a choice.
Friends come and go; a marriage may last or fail, but once you’re a mother there is no such thing as divorcing your children. Being a mother is the hardest job ever; it is “till death do you part”. As a mother, you try your best to make sure your children do not make the same mistakes that you did.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“As a single mother, I feel like I carry the weight of the ocean on my shoulders trying to keep my head above water to keep from drowning. I try to stand firm as I dig my toes in the sand, but the troubling waves tend to wash the sand away from under my feet. I lose my balance, but I have to make the best of what I am given; take a leap of faith and start swimming.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Look deep within your soul and ask yourself—no matter who it concerns—is it worth it?
Is it worth losing your outer and inner peace?
Is it worth your happiness?
Is it worth your sanity?
If they are causing you stress; let them go and cut the cord.
The question that needs to be asked is—who do you love more? Yourself, or making other people happy?”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“As a woman, it’s hard to stay grounded when every time you think you are doing something right, someone wants to pull up the roots you took so long to plant.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A woman imagines what she wants, and plans mentally for the transition. She gathers strength to prepare for the emotional challenges in her life that lie ahead. Conflicts try to break her stride but although she is filled with pain, she still walks with confidence, and with a smile on her face.
When there is a world of distractions and difficult decisions to make, when a woman finds herself straying off the tracks, she will not feel defeated.
She is courageous!
She is victorious!
She is a pioneer!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“As a woman, you are always empowering others and helping people out of their situations. The time has come, and the time is now, for you to take charge of your own journey. It doesn’t matter how young or how old you are. It is time for you to freefall into giving yourself a chance at love, and the first person you should fall in love with is yourself.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“I wonder why a woman has to work one hundred times harder than her male counterparts. Every time I look around, I see that a woman has to prove to people that she is worthy of the same respect and appreciation that others receive. Why is it that a woman has to compromise her self-worth to please other people and make them happy? Is that fair?”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“There are too many women who haven’t had the chance to fall in love with themselves. Your sacrifices weren’t for nothing. Each sacrifice you made was by choice to help others as you put them first. With each sacrifice that you made, you took chances, and the uphill battles of carrying the weight on your shoulders toned your core.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Ladies, it’s harvest time!!! Take care of your crops, water them and weed them out.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A woman’s strength and character shouldn’t ever be underestimated, although time and time again women are taken for granted. A woman has a choice; just like anyone else on this earth—she doesn’t have to give her all for her family, friends, or co-workers.
Women are human, just like everyone else. However, a woman is treated as though she’s not. It is beyond ridiculous that a woman always has to justify her actions in lengthy detail in every situation and the person she encounters.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A woman’s strength is unstoppable as she takes on the loads she is given in life. We, as women, shouldn’t ever underestimate our ability. We are warriors, and if it wasn’t for our great strength of perseverance, what would the world be like today?
We have to learn how to put ourselves first. We have to stop cheating ourselves by putting other people’s needs first, and our needs and wants last.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Being a mother isn’t an easy task. It has its ups and downs, joy and difficult moments. I wish more children could see that a mother’s love should never be undervalued. A mother’s love is priceless and unconditional without asking for anything in return except for appreciation, respect, gratitude, and for them to do well in school.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“In a marriage, a woman has to be the backbone, the compromiser; yet half the time she feels powerless. Marriage isn’t easy. There are a lot of pitfalls, steep uphill battles, obstacles, compromises, and sacrifices. As the saying goes, the man is the head of the household, but truth be told, I am still trying to understand how that is so. There are some good men out there who successfully honor their role as a husband and a father to their children. However, there are so many single mothers in the world today who are the heads of households, being both the mother and the father.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A woman is always carrying other people’s burdens, kicked to the ground, scorned, and damaged to the core. When a woman is going along at a steady pace, someone comes along to knock her off balance. A woman falls more often than she likes to. That’s okay, give yourself a shake and dust it off. A woman can be bruised many times, but she is not broken, and she always rises above it.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Wake up! Become more aware and alive of what feeds YOUR soul without seeking permission from others. Many curve balls have been thrown. Don’t hesitate—NOW is the time to hit a home run.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Change is like pulling the wool from your eyes and seeing the light for the first time. If you are set in your old ways, it takes people who care about you to help you get over as many hurdles as it takes to finish the course.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Darkness, also represent truth—I notice there are a lot of people in the world today whose true colors come out in their darkest hours. They are good at hiding in the light because they are afraid the darkness will unveil their fear and who they truly are as a person.
If darkness didn’t exist, the stars and the moon wouldn’t be able to shine. The stars give me hope; as they shine so brightly, I know my blessings will shine even brighter. Embrace the darkness; it will give you well-needed rest, and as you walk out into the light the sun will complement your renewed strength.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“When you can’t provide for them anymore, their true character comes out. They treat you like pure shit. To make matters worse, they talk trash behind your back, as if what you’ve done for them was useless. That’s how some people are—they will use you up and break you down until you have nothing left to give them or yourself. People who do not have anything to lose will make sure you lose everything you’ve work so hard for.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A woman sacrifices more than she is given, and nobody is willing to take any of the pain that they have caused. Yet she is running at full speed without a break, and her world is crumbling from carrying everyone else’s problems. Where are the extended hands? They are nowhere to be found.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“We live in a cruel world. People are dreadfully cold. I have never seen so many dishonest, selfish and greedy people. They are willing to use others until they get exactly what they want. What makes matters even worse, after they get what they want, they come back and ask for more. Sadly, people do not have any empathy for others. They are like leeches and will suck the blood out of you until you have nothing left.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Sacrifices and resentments leave a woman standing on the edge, but she doesn’t have the nerve to look down or jump. As a woman struggles through the days trying to soothe the hurt, but every time she turns around it spreads like wildfire. She is left alone in the middle of a crisis. As women, we ask ourselves over and over again, how long do I have to wait? When will the torture end?”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“I never understood why a woman’s strength, character and hard work are underestimated. A woman has to prove herself to be worthy in just about everything she does. When it comes to her relationships such as friendship, marriage, being a mother, daughter, sister, and a co-worker, someone will find fault in what she does because nothing is ever good enough.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“f I knew then what I know now—I would have chosen me. I would have loved me more. I would have put a smile on my face. I would have made sure I laughed at least three times a day or more; the more the better. I would have fallen in love with the peace that was surrounding me. Self-fulfillment is what I would have given more of to myself.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“If I knew then what I know now—I would have chosen me. I would have loved me more. I would have put a smile on my face.

Self-fulfillment is what I would have given more of to myself.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Sadly, a lot of things took a turn for the worse in my life, but they taught me a lesson. They helped me to become the person who I am today. In my late thirties, I am learning so much about myself; and still learning. I am so in love with myself more than I’ve ever been! I feel free and at peace. Life is good! It is getting better and better every day!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“There are stages in life that you must go through to find out the true value of your worth. I learned that nobody knows your worth but you. Nobody will value you more than yourself. People will treat you according to how much you can take.
Do you know how much can you take? Do you know your limits?
I had to go through hell and beyond to answer both questions. When I look back, I ask myself, who’s to blame?”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“When I let go of everyone’s problems and focused on me, I gained a lot of knowledge about myself I didn’t know. I finally realized the definition of peace, joy, love, and happiness. When I started to give more to myself, I learned to love myself wholeheartedly.
Most importantly, I learned that nobody would love me more than I love myself. I am the only person who will love hard on me. Therefore, I learned how to live in a self-fulfilling mode, and I wouldn’t have it any other way!”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“As a woman, a true loyal friendship is important. Truth be told, it takes patience and a lot of work. You will have some friendships that will be underestimated and tested. Most definitely, there will be some friendships that will come and go. However, there will be friendships and sisterhoods that will last a lifetime. A true sister will walk through the fire with you; and after she walks through the fire, she will stand against the rough currents with you. Nobody is perfect. True sisterhood is a gift that absolutely holds your love together.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Without fail, a woman is always walking into the unknown. It seems as though it is so easy to blame and point the finger at a woman. What others fail to realize is that a woman might not always know what lies ahead of her, but she will always find a way to get through it.
When she hits the ground, she will bounce right back up. The road may twist and turn; there will be a few steep hills and sharp curves, but she will never give up because she is unstoppable.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A woman lives with resentment. Resentment hurts, and it is a throbbing pain that leaves deep scars. Although some of the scars heal, the resentment lingers on. When she kneels to pray, she feels as if her prayers fall on deaf ears; the burdens are intolerable.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Love abounds against all odds. One thing about love is that it comes with many sacrifices. Its good intentions always reassure you that in order to love someone else, you must be willing to love yourself first.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Life has a funny way of expressing itself. I learned that during light or darkness we have to trust the path and follow directions in order to survive the transformation.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A woman is a visionary. She gathers great strength through the hardest challenges. She suits up for the battles that are set before her and executes them without hesitation.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“A woman always gives away the heart of her soul; to her husband and/or significant other, children, family, friends, and in the workplace. A woman goes through so much emotionally, physically, and mentally. However, most of the time it goes unnoticed.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Slowly but surely, the darkness revealed light; and as the dim light shine brighter, I was mentally, physically, and emotionally prepared to battle the raging storms and the unfair, distasteful barriers. When my bags were too heavy and weighing me down, the darkness taught me when to put them down and focus on me. It taught me when to let go and know I could not change the situation. Most importantly, the darkness taught me that I could work through my trying times and make the best of what I was given.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“As a little girl, a woman is groomed to become a wife and a mother. She is trained to always make wise decisions, yet there will forever be limits and boundaries. As I look back, I remember being told what I could and could not do, simply because I was a girl.
A little girl is told she cannot act like a boy; if she does, she will be classified as a “tomboy”. Climbing trees was prohibited, instead, she was taught to put a baby doll in a stroller and take the doll for a walk. She couldn’t sit as she pleased; she was told to only sit with her ankles crossed.
Girls were given a kitchen playset that was equipped with a stove, sink, and an accessory set of play food dishes, pots, and pans, etc., along with a tea set to bring out the “elegance” in them. As the saying goes, “Girls are sugar and spice, and everything nice.”
I’m taken aback by how girls are groomed to be a certain way; however, boys are able to love life and live freely without limitations and criticism.”

“Darkness is not a bad place; it depends on how one looks at it. It keeps me from going insane and losing my mind. Darkness rejuvenates my mind, restores peace and teaches me how to pray and ask for help. When we prepare for rest, we want the room to be dark; therefore, we close the blinds, cut off the lights and television, and eliminate any distractions so we can get a peaceful night’s rest. Darkness renews your mind. It restores your energy and it gives you the strength you need to get through another day.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“The darkness taught me to trust my intuition. It helped me to coordinate and bring peace within my center when I walked into the unknown. The darkness helped me to know when I needed to surrender and to dissect each circumstance.”

“The darkness wasn’t negative energy, it was healing—it balanced my soul. It helped me to trust whatever unfolded and to believe and have faith in what I couldn’t see. It prepared me for the battles that I wasn’t prepared for. They sneaked up on me and revealed themselves without notice. When obstacles jumped out at me without warning, I knew I wasn’t alone. My faith was improving during the darkest hours of my life.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Love is a strange word. It can be misleading and confusing. It can break you down with tender grace and mercy, while at the same time building you up to become a powerful force—and after that, you will never be the same.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“The ripple effects of love are beautiful and peaceful, yet can also be disturbing and ruthless. At times, love takes advantage of its powers; it causes you to suffer from loving someone too much and finding yourself lost, without hope and giving too much of yourself to the point that you suffer because you’re neglecting yourself.”
― Charlena E. Jackson, A Woman's Love Is Never Good Enough

“Love is an intense emotion that will take a toll on you mentally, emotionally and physically in an unselfish, yet bittersweet way that develops into a deep affection; and sometimes, an unknown outcome.”

“Bạn hỏi mình về cảm giác khi yêu, mình hỏi có bao giờ bạn cảm thấy mọi điều cùng lúc chưa? Êm đềm và ray rứt, ồn ào và lặng lẽ, ấm áp và cô độc, thấu hiểu và riêng rẽ... đều có cả, nhưng rất ít tính sở hữu, không giày vò nhau, không cố gây đau đớn cho nhau để được nhung nhớ, không đòi hỏi bằng nhu cầu được cho đi, được vỗ về họ, được bù đắp, được an ủi họ. Thế là ở giữa vườn hoa đầy ắp tình yêu rồi. Cảm giác đó nếu một lần chảy qua trong đời sẽ trở thành cột mốc lớn lao, là chất làm mềm đi trái tim chai sạn và giải phóng những khúc ca chưa từng được hát..”

To any place or to any other person in the whole world
But myself …”

“But we’ve spent a lifetime being afraid of making wrong choices that we have never had the guts to make any.
We’ve wasted our days worrying about what may happen next that we’ve forgotten to enjoy what’s really happening.
We’ve stayed where we should’ve left.
We cared for what we had to ignore.

In that room, there is nothing to hear
But a love song of free birds.
In that room there is nothing to feel
But their flipping wings flying through my chest.
For this room has always been the peace that never fails to end my wars.
And it will always be the reason why I’ve never looked for home in others, as long as the warmest and safest home is there ;
Inside of me ….”

With time I’ve seen much cruelty towards good people that instead of being cherished, they are actually being used.
Instead of being appreciated and valued, they are being taken for granted and considered as an option or a backup plan.
Because whenever those ones are needed they gonna be there and their doors are always wide open.
So there is no need to wonder why this world is only getting filthier and uglier. Since we have always been ruining everything beautiful left around .
even those rare, kind and loving souls in our life...”

“i was once swallowed in a dark shroud
of fear, pain, and self-loathing
which i believed i couldn’t voice
because if i spoke of my loneliness
would it not prove my uselessness?
light could not break the shadows
unless i asked for help
and when i finally became so lost
i reached out in desperation
for even the smallest guidance
every tearful thought i had hidden
was exposed in all of its falsehood

Then you can pull from the root of your brand content to create authentic messaging to communicate & engage with others. When you are rooted in authenticity, the message can grow and branch out farther.”

“Self-examination requires time alone spent in thoughtful study. We naturally fear aloneness, which reluctance can stifle attaining self-knowledge. In her 1942 memoir titled ‘West with the Night,. Beryl Marham spoke eloquently why we must overcome our fear of aloneness and conduct a search for our inner authenticity. “You can live a lifetime and, at the end of it, know more about other people than you know about yourself. You learn to watch other people, but you never watch yourself because you strive against loneliness. If you read a book, or shuffle a deck of cards, or care for a dog, you are avoiding yourself. The abhorrence of loneliness is as natural as wanting to live at all. If it were otherwise, men would never have bothered to make the alphabet, nor to have fashioned words out of what were only animal sounds, nor to have crossed continents – each man to see what the other looked like.”

“We have to stop quantifying ourselves. Why as people do we identify our lives and a part of our identities as 20 something's or 30 something's. I am very much alive. I notice the heavy warm breeze, the blue of the sky, my chocolate kind of freckles that form from the warm sun...my god that sun. The warmth. I hear the sound of night. I recognize the vastness of the sky. The stars all those stars. Our lives are some kind of special. I'm done being so quick about it or so mundane about it. We are not chipmunks or squirrels in that way we can actually chew our food slowly. Taste the temperature of our drinks. Our lives are so short already. We are so small in this gigantic space sweating over small things as opposed to taking in the little things. There will always be something to do or something happening how we handle it is all the difference. We are small in such a huge colossal universe that somewhere someone bigger than us is probably laughing. Love. Eat well. Wonder. Just be...in the moment. Laugh. Spread joy.

“There is no standard in creativity , but there are guidelines. Never limit yourself. Go wild and create what you see and feel is right. I believe there is no wrong art as long it comes from within. Those who object what you created don’t understand your art. It doesn’t mean your creativity is wrong. Sometimes it takes times for people to understand and to adopt to something new. Don’t doubt yourself or give up, because of negative comments on your craft.”

We don’t value others people. We cyber bully others and do disguising inhuman things for trends. Pride ourselves in destroying others lives, careers, education, relationship, marriage, future. The things we do for retweets, likes and comments are shocking. Choose to be a better human being than being a Bot.”

“It was night again. The Waystone Inn lay in silence, and it was a silence of three parts.

The most obvious part was a hollow, echoing quiet, made by things that were lacking. If there had been a wind it would have sighed through the trees, set the inn’s sign creaking on its hooks, and brushed the silence down the road like trailing autumn leaves. If there had been a crowd, even a handful of men inside the inn, they would have filled the silence with conversation and laughter, the clatter and clamor one expects from a drinking house during the dark hours of night. If there had been music...but no, of course there was no music. In fact there were none of these things, and so the silence remained.

Inside the Waystone a pair of men huddled at one corner of the bar. They drank with quiet determination, avoiding serious discussions of troubling news. In doing this they added a small, sullen silence to the larger, hollow one. It made an alloy of sorts, a counterpoint.

The third silence was not an easy thing to notice. If you listened for an hour, you might begin to feel it in the wooden floor underfoot and in the rough, splintering barrels behind the bar. It was in the weight of the black stone hearth that held the heat of a long dead fire. It was in the slow back and forth of a white linen cloth rubbing along the grain of the bar. And it was in the hands of the man who stood there, polishing a stretch of mahogany that already gleamed in the lamplight.

The man had true-red hair, red as flame. His eyes were dark and distant, and he moved with the subtle certainty that comes from knowing many things.

The Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as autumn’s ending. It was heavy as a great river-smooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.”

Not because of a woman or a man. Not because of a job. Not because of success. She realized something kind of special. Life was too precious. Life is too precious. Life is way too miraculous to leave the key in a stranger’s pocket. She grasped it and felt the metal key in her own hands, in her own pocket. She didn’t need to knock on doors anymore.

Love the person you love without any doubt, irregardless who says what.
Love does not have limits, parameters, boundaries or imperfections.

hesitation. Love is for all.
Everyone deserve to be loved, no matter who they are or how they are.
Everyone deserve to be given a chance to express themselves.”

“39 · Remorse

His mind, now goaded by an intolerable desire to know her, see her, have and own her, to mine her life up bit by bit out of the depthless pit of time and the furious oblivion of the city’s life, and to join it, root and branch with all the fibrous tendrils of everything that she had seen and known and touched, to his own, prowled beastwise back across the jungle of the past, scenting the final limits and last implications of every casual word, each story, scene, or moment, each sight or sound or odor he had torn from her in three years with his tireless and insatiate hunger.

“9 · Home from the Mountain

And above them the stormy wintry skies—sometimes a savage sky of wild, torn grey that came so low its scudding fringes whipped like rags of smoke around the mountain tops; sometimes an implacable, fierce sky of wintry grey; sometimes a sky of rags and tatters of wild, wintry light, westering into slashed stripes of rugged red and incredible wild gold at the gateways of the sun—bent over them forever with that same savage and unutterable pain and sorrow, that ecstasy of wild desire, that grief of desolation, that spirit of exultant joy, that was as gleeful, mad, fierce, lonely, and enchanted with its stormy and unbodied promises of flight, its mad swoopings through the dark over the whole vast sleeping wintriness of earth, as that stormy and maniacal wind, which seemed, in fact, to be the very spirit of the joy, the sorrow, and the wild desire he felt.

А над тях се стелеха бурните зимни небеса, понякога свирепо сиви с провиснали, парцаливи облаци, които с димните си валма обвиваха планинските върхове, друг път — диви и неумолими в студената си зимна сивота, или пък целите надрани и разкъсани от вледяващата зимна светлина, която на запад, пред самите слънчеви двери, се набраздяваше на разнище¬ни ивици от невероятно сияйно бакърено злато, схлупени отгоре им със същата пронизваща и неизразима болка и мъка, с онзи екстаз на дива страст, с онази безутешна скръб, с онзи дух на необуздана радост, така възторжен, безумен, бурен, самотен и прехласнат във вихрените си безплътни обещания за полет, в своето лудо стрелкане из мрака над обширната, потънала в зимен сън земя, както и бурният пощръклял вятър, който като че ли беше самият дух на радостта, мъката и дивата страст, обсебили момчето.”

“29 · The Ring and the Book

The whole passionate enigma of life, the living contradiction, the undemonstrable but overwhelming unity which comprises every antithesis by which men live and die, is evoked by the spirit of Spring as by no other season. And yet, to the young man, this time of year often seems to be the time of chaos and confusion. For him it is the time of the incoherence of the senses, the wild, tongueless cries of pain, joy, and hunger, the fierce, broken wanderings of his desire, the lust for a thousand unknown and unnameable things which maddens his brain, disturbs his vision, and rends his heart asunder.

Цялата вълнуваща загадка на живота, живото противоречие, ненатрапчивото, но непреодолимо единство на всички антитези в живота и смъртта на хората се пробуждат с такава сила само от духа на пролетта. За младия човек обаче този годишен сезон често е време на бъркотия и хаос. За него това е период на объркани чувства, на необуздани и безмълвни изблици на болка, радост и копнеж, на жестоко и безрезултатно лутане в света на желанията, на стремеж към незнайното и безименното, което подлудява мислите му, разстройва взора му, разкъсва сърцето му.”

“30 · First Party

And even the very skies that framed New York, the texture of the night itself, seemed to have the architecture and the weather of the city’s special quality. It was, he saw, a Northern city: the bases of its form were vertical. Even the night here, the quality of darkness, had a structural framework, an architecture of its own. Here, compared with the qualities of night in London or in Paris, which were rounder, softer, of more drowsy hue, the night was vertical, lean, immensely clifflike, steep and clear. Here everything was sharp. It burned so brightly, yet it burned sweetly, too. For what was so incredible and so lovely about this high, cool night was that it could be so harsh and clear, so arrogantly formidable, and yet so tender, too. There were always in these nights, somehow, even in nights of clear and bitter cold, not only the structure of lean steel, but a touch of April, too: they could be insolent and cruel, and yet there was always in them the suggestion of light feet, of lilac darkness, of something swift and fleeting, almost captured, ever gone, a maiden virginal as April.

Дори самото небе, надвиснало над Ню Йорк, дори тъканта на нощта като че ли бяха придобили специфичната структура и настроението на града. Това беше северен тип град - линиите му бяха предимно вертикални. Тук дори нощта и тъмнината притежаваха собствен строеж и архитектура. В сравнение с нощите на Париж и Лондон, които бяха по-овални, по-меки и по-сънливи, нощта на Ню Йорк беше вертикална, източена, наподобяваща безкрайно стръмна и гладка стена. Тук всичко беше остро и ръбато, и блясъкът му беше остър, но и така приятен. Невероятното и очарователното в тази блестяща студена нощ беше, че тя можеше да бъде неприветлива и сурова, арогантно страховита и в същото време толкова мека и нежна. Винаги в такива нощи, дори когато бяха сурови и леденостудени, се долавяше дъхът не само на стоманените конструкции, но и на април: те можеха да бъдат нагли и жестоки и все пак в тях долитаха леки стъпки. Обгръщаше ги теменужна тъма, имаше нещо бързо и преходно, почти уловимо и вечно изплъзващо се, моминско и девствено като април.”

“30 · First Party

His untried youth was not able to understand, would perhaps have been unwilling to face the grim fact, that man’s conflict with the forces of reality is unceasing, that life is an ordeal to which a true man must expose and steel himself with ever-increasing fortitude, that for the artist most of all in this hard world there is no security, that he, above all other men, must draw his nourishment from stone, win through to glory and his soul’s salvation with a taste of steel upon his lips—and that there is for him no comfortable retreat behind green shutters and warm lights as long as life waxes in him and endures.

Неговата все още лишена от опит младост не можеше да разбере, или по-скоро не искаше да приеме неприятния факт, че сблъсъците на хората с действителността са непрестанни, че животът е изпитание, на което истинският човек трябва, да се изложи и да го посреща с все по-голяма твърдост и душевна сила, че в този труден свят има много малко сигурност за твореца, че той повече от всички останали трябва да извлича прехраната си от камъка, да извоюва славата си и да спаси душата си с вкус на стомана в устата, че за него няма удобно убежище зад зелени щори и топла светлина и че в жилите му кипи живот, докато се крепи на тази земя.”

Then, you let it cook slowly—oh, very slowly, for several hours—it’s a very delicate operation—you’ve got to keep your eye on what you’re doing all the time—so few of these women you meet nowadays will take the trouble. . . . But it’s got to be done very slowly and carefully until the flavor of the beef has got into all the vegetables and the flavor of the vegetables has got into the beef.” She went on in a very earnest tone, a lowered voice: “It’s like a masterpiece—a symposium, you know—all the parts so delicately blended that each is all and all is each.”
He, tenderly, in a gently tranced tone: “The vegetables, you said?”

И е важно да се готви бавно — много бавно — поне няколко часа — това е тънка работа — през цялото време трябва да внимаваш какво става — много малко днешни жени ще си направят този труд... Но трябва много бавно да се готви, и много внимателно, така че ароматът на говеждото да влезе във всички зеленчуци, а месото да поеме техния мирис. (Тя продължи с много сериозен тон и леко сниши глас.) Това е нещо като шедьовър — нещо като симпозиум — всичко фино да смеси, че просто да стане едно. В едното да е всичко и всичко да е в едно.

“49. Мрачен октомври

стр. 743
Домогваме се до живота с тези словесни мрежи и капани, безумието ни расте с безсилието ни, опитваме се да запазим и задържим нещичко с цялата плодовита яловост на буквите и резултатът от всичко това са тези няколко хартийки, които се носят от вятъра. Не ни е дадено да притежаваме нищо, дори въздуха, който дишаме, а реката на живота и времето изтича от алчните ни ръце и с целия си глад и копнеж успяваме да задържим само няколко отделни трептящи мигове. И върху потъпканите и забравени думи, върху прахта и плесента на вчерашните погребения, хиляди пъти се раждаме в живота и смъртта и единственото, което ни остава, е уморената ни плът и натрапчивите ни случайни спомени.

49 · Dark October

We reach for life with all these traps and nets of words, our frenzy mounts up with our impotence, we try to keep and hold some single thing with all this fecund barrenness of print, and the sum of it all is a few blown papers in the wind. The possession of all things, even the air we breathe, is held from us, and the river of life and time flows through the grasp of our hands, and, for all our hunger and desire, we hold nothing except the trembling moments, one by one. Over the trodden and forgotten words, the rot and dusty burials of yesterday, we are born again into a thousand lives and deaths, and we are left forever with only the substance of our weary flesh, and the hauntings of an accidental memory.”

"When I commit to someone, I really commit to them. I know now that there's nobody out there who I care about as much as I do you. There's no one I would rather spend my life with."

They kissed.

It's true then, they thought. You really can meet the perfect person and live happily ever after.”

“When some people are choosing to work hard, not sleeping , sacrificing everything they have to fulfill their dreams. There are some who choose to interfere in their lives. Who dig in their pasts and who look for mistakes so that they can bring them down. Today if you Choose to use the same energy, skill, effort, data and resources to bring others down, or shaming them. Use it to better your life. You will go far and you will be successful just like them.”

“Just because an eloquent, articulate and well-spoken person is sharing something, does not make what they are saying, true. 

Just because someone can relay information with an engaging, exciting or enticing delivery, does not mean what is being said is fact. 

Deciding what is true based on only emotion and not connecting with logic, looking up facts and researching for the proof behind it, 
can be very dangerous. 

Back it up before you buy into it. ”

“36. Призракът на смъртта през април

В задния двор на старата тухлена къща, където живееше Мънк, един от тези малки, оградени дворове на нюйоркските къщи — частица от размерената площ на квартала, се виждаше парче стара изтощена земя, едно петно нежна тревица и едно-единствено дърво. През онзи април Мънк гледаше как ден след ден това дърво отново бързо се покрива с великолепната зеленина на младите си листа. И един ден, когато се взря в сърцевината на вълшебната му избуяла зеленина и забеляза как в нея проникват струйки трептяща светлина, как тоновете стават по-богати, как се менят и играят с най-незабележимите промени на светлината и с всеки най-нежен и неуловим полъх на вятъра, всичко това му се стори така живо, реално и силно, че то се превърна в магия и тайнство, събрало в себе си цялата мъчителна мечта на времето и човешкия живот. И внезапно той изпита чувството, че дървото се бе сляло със съдбата му, и видя живота си в цялата му мимолетност от раждането до смъртта.

И внезапно той изпита чувството, че дървото се бе сляло със съдбата му, и видя живота си в цялата му мимолетност от раждането до смъртта.
Въздействието на зеления цвят върху спомените му и чувството му за време го накараха да изпита своебразната сила и способността на пролетта да събужда у човека дълбокото, неуловимо и загадъчно усещане за неговата принадлежност към света. Първата зеленина на пролетта,и особено първата зеленина в града, не само обгръщаше целия хаос и безпорядък на града в огромната лирична хармония на живота, но и въздействаше магически върху всичките му спомени, така че целият живот, който пулсираше наоколо му се превръщаше в неделима част от всеки миг на собственото му съществование. По този начин миналото бе станало осезаемо като настоящето и той преживяваше събития отпреди двадесет години с такава сила и вълнение и чувство за реалност, като че ли се бяха случили току-що. Мънк усещаше, че във времето няма сегашно и минало, че никое „сега“ не е по-живо и действено от „тогава“, и така измислицата за непрекъснатостта на времето изчезна и целият му живот се превърна в едно нерушимо единство на време и съдба.
Така през онази пролет съзнанието му бе всецяло погълнато от вълшебството на магическата зеленина и затова в живота му като във фокус се събра цялата сила на едно видение: това беше видението на смъртта: унищожението, което, неизменно присъствуваше в хилядите, непрекъснато вълнуващи мисълта му образи. Той виждаше света в краските на смъртта не защото се опитваше да го прегърне, не защото искаше да се измъкне от този така непоносим живот и да отиде в някакво свое, приказно кътче, но защото от години жаждата му за знания, която бе така ненаситна, че не му даваше мира, докато до дъно не изчерпи същността и смисъла на нещата, все още го тласкаше напред към бягство към живота. Но сега му се струваше, че самият живот то е изиграл.”

“I know that your heart is broken and I know that no words will repair that. I know how hard that is and I know it will never be the same again. But I also know what kind of person you are and how you deal with life.
My friend, love is not how many times the words "I love you" have been said and it is not the long night talks or the going outs. Those add to the value of love but those are not 'love'. A good friend can offer you those. I know, love isn't meant to be easy but knowing what to defend and what to stand for is what defines love and what defines a person you can depend on. No one should use or abuse a relationship in any way.
Knowing a person will choose you over anything else. Knowing that you can sleep safe because you have someone who will fight the world to choose you. That is Love.
So, dear friend, let him leave because you deserve someone who wants to stay and who is willing to fight for it.”

“A Photographer's Poem

To take a photograph is to learn new steps
Like a toddler's first walk from start to end
Visualize a dream, a paradigm, a theme
It could be about anywhere, anyone, any moment or anything
Let that sink in until your eyes see clearly
What image you cease to create to preserve in dearly
With a camera you take the picture in mind
A photographer's mistake is to leave it behind
Take it wherever a journey is to take place
There will always be something that comes across your ways”

“The coast of Maine has many fishing villages and old seaports, and its past is steeped in maritime history. Twelve miles from Bath, we came into Wiscasset, known for the wrecks of two old sailing vessels: the four-masted cargo schooners the Hesper and the Luther Little. The Hesper was launched on the 4th of July, 1918. It was a wonderfully festive day when the Hesper was allowed to slide down the inclined ways, but because the ship builders had underestimated her weight, she only slid down the ways by about 10 yards before everything collapsed. The Hesper came to a grinding halt, but fortunately didn’t roll over.
It was not until that August before the ship was once again shored up, and launched into the Sheepscot River. Her master was Captain Caleb A. Haskell from Deer Isle, who then sailed her to Lisbon, Portugal. On her maiden voyage she carried a 2,000 ton cargo of coal. I got to know Bo’sun, or Boatswain, Vernon Haskell, who drove the bus that later picked me up in Bangor. He also came from Deer Isle and sailed on these very same ships when he was a young man. Back in those days seafaring was a family tradition, and the Haskells were well-known seafaring folks in these parts. These two sailing ships are now gone and with their loss, some more maritime history is lost forever.”

“As long as you can look fearlessly at the sky, you'll know that you're pure within and will find happiness once more.”
― Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl

“This morning, when I was sitting in front of the window and taking a long, deep look outside at God and nature, I was happy, just plain happy. Peter, as long as people feel that kind of happiness within themselves, the joy of nature, health and much more besides, they'll always be able to recapture that happiness.
Riches, prestige, everything can be lost. But the happiness in your own heart can only be dimmed; it will always be there, as long as you live, to make you happy again.”
― Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl

“The best remedy for those who are frightened, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere they can be alone, alone with the sky, nature and God. For then and only then can you feel that everything is as it should be and that God wants people to be happy amid nature's beauty and simplicity,
As long as this exists, and that should be forever, I know that there will be solace for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances. I firmly believe that nature can bring comfort to all who suffer.”
― Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl

― Mike Bhangu

“Perhaps, those who wish for change are afraid of the loneliness and the ridicule that comes with questioning what most people believe is absolute. Maybe, they’re afraid of losing their material holdings in the battle to introduce the truth. Or perhaps, they’re yet to overcome the many sensual pleasures long enough to challenge and improve the world.

Whichever it may be, I experienced all three, so I understand the obstacles that prevent the mind from challenging. To challenge is to sacrifice the mind and body. But to know and not step into the boxing ring is blasphemy.”
― Mike Bhangu

“History is a continuous battle between the "haves" and the "have-nots". No matter if the "have-nots" think their shepherds.”
― Mike Bhangu

“To endeavor to understand the truth is like sparring bare-knuckle with confusion, frustration, and pain, or like entertaining the feelings of Van Gogh the moment before his demise. But to understand is like dancing with the emotions of Einstein when he discovered mass and energy have a bond, and to understand is to conquer the material world without unsheathing the tempered blade or firing the cannons.”
― Mike Bhangu

“Not too long ago, I set about examining the value system the manmade world influenced me to incubate. After opening it up and taking a closer look, to my surprise, I discovered it was virtually empty. The revelation was shattering. I felt like a squirrel that spent the entire summer gathering nuts to only realize, come winter, that the nutshells were empty.

So, I did what any rebel would. I turned my hat to the back, assumed the position of the thinking man, and rebuilt my cognitive content.

Today, I am a champion. Like “Money May” but of the consciousness.”
― Mike Bhangu

“The past gave reason for the passion. The heavens gave meaning to the lies. From a whisper in a living wind, grows a glimmer in my eyes. And strive I do, through the chambers of my inner self. And claim the prize I do, the key for the door I’ll face after the body falls.”
― Mike Bhangu

“I was built like this, a chameleon in essence, and I naturally become my environments. To that extent, to be or not to be? Wait, let me rephrase. What be the thing I’m bred to be? The two conditions of my humanity, my invisible and my biology, take shape according to my realities, and regrettably, in a world built by shepherd-less egos, half of me hibernates.”
― Mike Bhangu

“Like a Shakespearean tragedy, tragically, I was cast into an artificial realm that practices deliberate deception without the knowledge of what I be, how I be, and my natural information absorbing ability.”
― Mike Bhangu

“Answer me this my fellow humans—are we really on this earth to work an eight-hour shift, to have the productions of our blood and labour taken, to live pay-cheque to pay-cheque while balancing on a line of credit, to give forty years to a mortgaged existence, to sweat for the system when the financial chains will remain regardless, and to thirst strictly for the weekends?”
― Mike Bhangu

“We’ve turned. We’ve turned on our beginnings. We’ve turned to hurt the Mother of all earthly things, such as the seas, trees, lions, leaves, penguins, people, and chimpanzees. Dematerialized, we are forever family, including even fire, ice, and flying things.”
― Mike Bhangu

“Love God and love all God’s creations. If you’re lucky, The Source will send The Spirit. Sat Guru truthfully teaches and can activate The Word within. The Word’s resonance allows the “I” to experience the absolute reality. Through the mind of a mystic, union with The Great Architect can be achieved. A permanent love, in the truest sense, can soak through to every gene and every inch of a person’s being. Salvation can be yours, and the first step is to be.”
― Mike Bhangu

“If born amongst diamonds, a person will translate and shine. If born orbiting, a person will translate and rise. If born in the air, a person will translate and fly. But born to the artificial hardships of the 21st century and the upside-down popular beliefs, a person is simply passing time before they die.

The temperament of the human creature is to become and to befall the environments around her or him. This is a truth no woman or man can outrun. Can someone please tell those who rule the manmade world? The human has the potential of a demi-god.”
― Mike Bhangu

“I’ve searched high and low for the remedy to enter me. I’ve searched high and low for the right frequency to be with me. I searched high to light my mind and energy. I searched low to know the dark in me.

All this I did for harmony. All this I did for the immortal me. All this I did and found I have stardust in my shoes, yellow in New Orleans’ blues, water on the moon, and inside me, the primal celestial tune.”
― Mike Bhangu

“On this particular page of tomorrow’s history, ideal conditions only half be, and sadly, I’ll never see the places my dreams see. My mortal deficiencies prevent me from sitting with Guru Gobind’s Warrior-Poets and Plato’s Philosopher-Kings.

Nothing is gained by wanting social change. In today’s day and age, against the grain, the trolls of suffering and pain become friends and enemies. But what else am I to do? It’s the furthermost purpose. Besides, I’m forever built like this. It’s in my cultural genetics—genes designed behind a veil of ignorance and given by the Khalsa’s consciousness. One ally and it’s the Universe. Check the history, an anomaly. Starry-eyed and standing. I ask—is anyone else with eyes starry?”
― Mike Bhangu

“Perhaps, I’ve lost my senses. Maybe, I tripped and bumped my head against the ivory tower and knocked myself unconscious. Or perhaps, this is the nuance of the infamous. Or maybe, this is the plight of the good-hearted.”
― Mike Bhangu

“This idea of a life-long mortgage doesn’t make sense. Why? Well, my life is worth more than half an acre with a structure on it. Without hesitation, I’m willing to give a decade. Perhaps then, enough youth with remain to experience the one life and the one world.”
― Mike Bhangu

“Hear the words of a hater and listen to the thorns. Yet, move up-close and experience the fragrance of a rose. I am Mike Bhangu.”

“The world can be a better place. The problems that plague are manmade. However, the people able to elevate human living, those few with the resources, influence, technology, time, and power, are preoccupied with something else, or they benefit from the status quo. Nothing else can explain their lack of action. Or perhaps, they lack the vision. If the latter is correct, the solution is simple, read my work. But if the former is so, which I think is true, then there is little hope for the common people. Unless of course, God intervenes and pushes the reset button to this video game called life. Or the people affected by the backwardness mobilize and retake their natural rights.”
― Mike Bhangu

“Through public policy, we can journey down a road less traveled. Through public policy, we can remedy the many problems. But first, public policy should be written to serve the public. Regrettably, the politicians fiddle while we, the new Romans, slowly turn to ashes.”

I no longer went within, which was a scary road. If you were once attacked on a road, you make sure to avoid it. But the avoidance means you also miss out on the wild flowers when they’re blooming, the snow-capped mountains in winter, the waterfall, the deer, the beautiful people, like Tony, who walk there every day. You also miss out on knowing yourself better, on understanding what is important to you.”

“The Scottish Conscience

"Jeanie" said the Duke, "you must have doch an'dorroch, or you will be unable to travel."
There was a salver with cake and wine on the table. He took up a glass, drank "to all true hearts that lo'ed Scotland," and offered a glass to his guest.
Jeanie, however, declined it, saying, "that she had never tasted wine in her life."
"How comes that, Jeanie?" said the Duke,- "wine maketh glad the heart, you know."
"Ay, sir, but my father is like Jonadab, the son of Rechab, who charged his children that they should drink no wine."
"I thought your father would have had more sense," said the Duke, "unless, indeed, he prefers brandy. But however, Jeanie, if you will not drink, you must eat, to save the character of my house.”

But, I penned my own a decade ago. It was about a specific time. I'm not even the same person from one minute to the next, let alone a decade ago.

“Much of what I had was handed down to me from others. The fact that I was now the oldest child, since my sister had died, put me first in line for toys. Not that the toys and clothing I acquired were necessarily new, nor were they gender specific, but they were newer when I got them, than later, when they were passed farther down the line. It didn’t matter that my sister was a girl…. A coat was a coat, except for how it was buttoned. Looking at old photographs, I sometimes find it impossible to tell if I am looking at my sister or me. It’s only when I see my nautical blue coat, with miniature petty officer chevrons on it that I’m certain that I’m looking at myself. As a baby, I wore her gowns and sleepwear, and this continued until they were worn out, or I outgrew them. Of course I inherited most of her toys, including a plunger type metal top and her beautiful, porcelain dolls. I don’t believe that these dolls were ever for play. They were beautiful enough to have been collectors’ items, but in my hands, they were doomed.”

Maybe that’s why I love you; because, in your presence, the noise in my head dies down, and there’s no clutter, just clarity. What a weird thing love is…now, would you like some tea? […]”
