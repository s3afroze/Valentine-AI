“I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.”
― C.S. Lewis

“Some people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them," I said.

"Right, of course. But you keep the promise anyway. That's what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”
― John Green, The Fault in Our Stars

“All the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust.”
― J.M. Barrie, Peter Pan

“I believe in everything until it's disproved. So I believe in fairies, the myths, dragons. It all exists, even if it's in your mind. Who's to say that dreams and nightmares aren't as real as the here and now?”
― John Lennon

“Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens.”
― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring

“I think if I've learned anything about friendship, it's to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you. Don't walk away, don't be distracted, don't be too busy or tired, don't take them for granted. Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff.”
― Jon Katz

“I have great faith in fools - self-confidence my friends will call it.”
― Edgar Allan Poe, Marginalia

“If he’s not calling you, it’s because you are not on his mind. If he creates expectations for you, and then doesn’t follow through on little things, he will do same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that he’s okay with disappointing you. Don’t be with someone who doesn’t do what they say they’re going to do. If he’s choosing not to make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to a recurring fight, then he doesn’t respect your feelings and needs. “Busy” is another word for “asshole.” “Asshole” is another word for the guy you’re dating. You deserve a fcking phone call.”
― Greg Behrendt

“And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.”

The sun never says to the earth,
"You owe Me."

Look what happens with
A love like that,
It lights the Whole Sky.”
― Hafiz

“Never be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God.”
― Corrie ten Boom

“The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.”
― Soren Kierkegaard

“I have come to accept the feeling of not knowing where I am going. And I have trained myself to love it. Because it is only when we are suspended in mid-air with no landing in sight, that we force our wings to unravel and alas begin our flight. And as we fly, we still may not know where we are going to. But the miracle is in the unfolding of the wings. You may not know where you're going, but you know that so long as you spread your wings, the winds will carry you.”
― C. JoyBell C.

“I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.”
― C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

“Keep Going

Your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. Keep going. Tough situations build strong people in the end.”
― Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart

“Sometimes beautiful things come into our lives out of nowhere. We can't always understand them, but we have to trust in them. I know you want to question everything, but sometimes it pays to just have a little faith.”
― Lauren Kate, Torment

“Faith is not the belief that God will do what you want. It is the belief that God will do what is right.”
― Max Lucado, He Still Moves Stones: Everyone Needs a Miracle

“You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is like an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.”
― Mahatma Gandhi

“Do not be afraid; our fate
Cannot be taken from us; it is a gift.”
― Dante Alighieri, Inferno

“All I have seen teaches me to trust the Creator for all I have not seen.”
― Ralph Waldo Emerson

“Therefore, dear Sir, love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you. For those who are near you are far away... and this shows that the space around you is beginning to grow vast.... be happy about your growth, in which of course you can't take anyone with you, and be gentle with those who stay behind; be confident and calm in front of them and don't torment them with your doubts and don't frighten them with your faith or joy, which they wouldn't be able to comprehend. Seek out some simple and true feeling of what you have in common with them, which doesn't necessarily have to alter when you yourself change again and again; when you see them, love life in a form that is not your own and be indulgent toward those who are growing old, who are afraid of the aloneness that you trust.... and don't expect any understanding; but believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it.”
― Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet

“None of us knows what might happen even the next minute, yet still we go forward. Because we trust. Because we have Faith.”
― Paulo Coelho, Brida

“I'm about to make a wild, extreme and severe relationship rule: the word busy is a load of crap and is most often used by assholes. The word "busy" is the relationship Weapon of Mass Destruction. It seems like a good excuse, but in fact in every silo you uncover, all you're going to find is a man who didn't care enough to call. Remember men are never to busy to get what they want.”
― Greg Behrendt

“I talk to God but the sky is empty.”
― Sylvia Plath

“A star falls from the sky and into your hands. Then it seeps through your veins and swims inside your blood and becomes every part of you. And then you have to put it back into the sky. And it's the most painful thing you'll ever have to do and that you've ever done. But what's yours is yours. Whether it’s up in the sky or here in your hands. And one day, it'll fall from the sky and hit you in the head real hard and that time, you won't have to put it back in the sky again.”
― C. JoyBell C.

“Sometimes God allows what he hates to accomplish what he loves.”
― Joni Eareckson Tada, The God I Love

“I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice?”
― C.S. Lewis

“I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat and death.”
― Nelson Mandela, Long Walk to Freedom: Autobiography of Nelson Mandela

“A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything.”
― Friedrich Nietzsche

“To have Faith in Christ means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. Not doing these things in order to be saved, but because He has begun to save you already. Not hoping to get to Heaven as a reward for your actions, but inevitably wanting to act in a certain way because a first faint gleam of Heaven is already inside you.”
― C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

“Believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it.”

“There's so much to be grateful for, words are poor things.”

“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”

“Patience Is Not the Ability to Wait:
Patience is not the ability to wait. Patience is to be calm no matter what happens, constantly take action to turn it to positive growth opportunities, and have faith to believe that it will all work out in the end while you are waiting.”
― Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart

“What was love, really? Flowers, chocolate, and poetry? Or was it something else? Was it being able to finish someone's jokes? Was it having absolute faith that someone was there at your back?

― Richelle Mead, Last Sacrifice

“Doubt everything. Find your own light.”

“Now very much against her will, she thought of the way Jace had looked at her then, the blaze of faith in his eyes, his belief in her. He had always thought she was strong. He had showed it in everything he did, in every look and every touch. Simon had faith in her too, yet when he'd held her, it had been as if she were something fragile, something made of delicate glass. But Jace had held her with all the strength he had, never wondering if she could take it--he'd known she was as strong has he was.”
― Cassandra Clare, City of Glass

― Nicholas Sparks, A Walk to Remember

― Libba Bray

“This is what the past is for! Every experience God gives us, every person He puts in our lives is the perfect preparation for the future that only He can see.”
― Corrie Ten Boom, The Hiding Place

“Over the years, I have come to realize that the greatest trap in our life is not success, popularity, or power, but self-rejection. Success, popularity, and power can indeed present a great temptation, but their seductive quality often comes from the way they are part of the much larger temptation to self-rejection. When we have come to believe in the voices that call us worthless and unlovable, then success, popularity, and power are easily perceived as attractive solutions. The real trap, however, is self-rejection. As soon as someone accuses me or criticizes me, as soon as I am rejected, left alone, or abandoned, I find myself thinking, "Well, that proves once again that I am a nobody." ... [My dark side says,] I am no good... I deserve to be pushed aside, forgotten, rejected, and abandoned. Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the "Beloved." Being the Beloved constitutes the core truth of our existence.”
― Henri J.M. Nouwen

“To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.”
― G.K. Chesterton

“Your children are the greatest gift God will give to you, and their souls the heaviest responsibility He will place in your hands. Take time with them, teach them to have faith in God. Be a person in whom they can have faith. When you are old, nothing else you've done will have mattered as much.”
― Lisa Wingate

“According to Vedanta, there are only two symptoms of enlightenment, just two indications that a transformation is taking place within you toward a higher consciousness. The first symptom is that you stop worrying. Things don't bother you anymore. You become light-hearted and full of joy. The second symptom is that you encounter more and more meaningful coincidences in your life, more and more synchronicities. And this accelerates to the point where you actually experience the miraculous. (quoted by Carol Lynn Pearson in Consider the Butterfly)”

“Well, it's true that I have been hurt in my life. Quite a bit. But it's also true that I have loved, and been loved. and that carries a weight of its own. A greater weight, in my opinion. It's like that pie chart we talked about earlier. in the end, I'll look back on my life and see that the greatest piece of it was love. The problems, the divorces, the sadness... those will be there too, but just smaller slivers, tiny pieces.”

“Faith is about doing. You are how you act, not just how you believe.”
― Mitch Albom, Have a Little Faith: a True Story

“Whether or not you believe in God, you must believe this: when we as a species abandon our trust in a power greater than us, we abandon our sense of accountability. Faiths… all faiths… are admonitions that there is something we cannot understand, something to which we are accountable. With faith we are accountable to each other, to ourselves, and to a higher truth. Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed. The church consists of a brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion in a world spinning out of control.”

Silence is Prayer
Prayer is Faith
Faith is Love
Love is Service
The Fruit of Service is Peace”
― Mother Teresa

“Why must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I’ll tell you what I'd do. I'd go out into a great big field all alone or in the deep, deep woods and I'd look up into the sky—up—up—up—into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness. And then I'd just feel a prayer.”
― L.M. Montgomery, Anne of Green Gables

“There are times when solitude is better than society, and silence is wiser than speech. We should be better Christians if we were more alone, waiting upon God, and gathering through meditation on His Word spiritual strength for labour in his service. We ought to muse upon the things of God, because we thus get the real nutriment out of them. . . . Why is it that some Christians, although they hear many sermons, make but slow advances in the divine life? Because they neglect their closets, and do not thoughtfully meditate on God's Word. They love the wheat, but they do not grind it; they would have the corn, but they will not go forth into the fields to gather it; the fruit hangs upon the tree, but they will not pluck it; the water flows at their feet, but they will not stoop to drink it. From such folly deliver us, O Lord. . . .”
― Charles Spurgeon

“We are saved by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone.”
― Martin Luther

“Faith is walking face-first and full-speed into the dark. If we truly knew all the answers in advance as to the meaning of life and the nature of God and the destiny of our souls, our belief would not be a leap of faith and it would not be a courageous act of humanity; it would just be... a prudent insurance policy.”
― Elizabeth Gilbert

“If you have a dream, don’t just sit there. Gather courage to believe that you can succeed and leave no stone unturned to make it a reality.”

“No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God . . . and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven.”
― Orson F. Whitney

“The moment God is figured out with nice neat lines and definitions, we are no longer dealing with God.”
― Rob Bell, Velvet Elvis: Repainting the Christian Faith

“When you get to the end of all the light you know and it's time to step into the darkness of the unknown, faith is knowing that one of two things shall happen: either you will be given something solid to stand on, or you will be taught how to fly.”
― Edward Teller

“Work without love is slavery.”
― Mother Teresa

“If we can just let go and trust that things will work out they way they're supposed to, without trying to control the outcome, then we can begin to enjoy the moment more fully. The joy of the freedom it brings becomes more pleasurable than the experience itself.”

“Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary. Some of us pray to Jesus, some of us go to Mecca, some of us study subatomic particles. In the end we are all just searching for truth, that which is greater than ourselves.”
― Dan Brown, Angels & Demons

“Faith ― acceptance of which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove.”
― Dan Brown, The Da Vinci Code

“Rejection is an opportunity for your selection.”

“My soul is in the sky.”
― William Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night's Dream

“Yes, I understand why things had to happen this way. I understand his reason for causing me pain. But mere understanding does not chase away the hurt. It does not call upon the sun when dark clouds have loomed over me. Let the rain come then if it must come! And let it wash away the dust that hurt my eyes!”
― Jocelyn Soriano, Mend My Broken Heart

“About once or twice every month I engage in public debates with those whose pressing need it is to woo and to win the approval of supernatural beings. Very often, when I give my view that there is no supernatural dimension, and certainly not one that is only or especially available to the faithful, and that the natural world is wonderful enough—and even miraculous enough if you insist—I attract pitying looks and anxious questions. How, in that case, I am asked, do I find meaning and purpose in life? How does a mere and gross materialist, with no expectation of a life to come, decide what, if anything, is worth caring about?

Depending on my mood, I sometimes but not always refrain from pointing out what a breathtakingly insulting and patronizing question this is. (It is on a par with the equally subtle inquiry: Since you don't believe in our god, what stops you from stealing and lying and raping and killing to your heart's content?) Just as the answer to the latter question is: self-respect and the desire for the respect of others—while in the meantime it is precisely those who think they have divine permission who are truly capable of any atrocity—so the answer to the first question falls into two parts. A life that partakes even a little of friendship, love, irony, humor, parenthood, literature, and music, and the chance to take part in battles for the liberation of others cannot be called 'meaningless' except if the person living it is also an existentialist and elects to call it so. It could be that all existence is a pointless joke, but it is not in fact possible to live one's everyday life as if this were so. Whereas if one sought to define meaninglessness and futility, the idea that a human life should be expended in the guilty, fearful, self-obsessed propitiation of supernatural nonentities… but there, there. Enough.”
― Christopher Hitchens, Hitch 22: A Memoir

“You can't know, you can only believe - or not.”
― C.S. Lewis

“Prejudice, a dirty word, and faith, a clean one, have something in common: they both begin where reason ends.”
― Harper Lee, Go Set a Watchman

“There will always be someone willing to hurt you, put you down, gossip about you, belittle your accomplishments and judge your soul. It is a fact that we all must face. However, if you realize that God is a best friend that stands beside you when others cast stones you will never be afraid, never feel worthless and never feel alone.”
― Shannon Alder

“There's a reason we refer to "leaps of faith" - because the decision to consent to any notion of divinity is a mighty jump from the rational over to the unknowable, and I don't care how diligently scholars of every religion will try to sit you down with their stacks of books and prove to you through scripture that their faith is indeed rational; it isn't. If faith were rational, it wouldn't be - by definition - faith. Faith is belief in what you cannot see or prove or touch. Faith is walking face-first and full-speed into the dark. If we truly knew all the answers in advance as to the meaning of life and the nature of God and the destiny of our souls, our belief would not be a leap of faith and it would not be a courageous act of humanity; it would just be... a prudent insurance policy.”
― Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love

“The most confused you will ever get is when you try to convince your heart and spirit of something your mind knows is a lie.”

“To be grateful is to recognize the Love of God in everything He has given us - and He has given us everything. Every breath we draw is a gift of His love, every moment of existence is a grace, for it brings with it immense graces from Him.
Gratitude therefore takes nothing for granted, is never unresponsive, is constantly awakening to new wonder and to praise of the goodness of God. For the grateful person knows that God is good, not by hearsay but by experience. And that is what makes all the difference.”
― Thomas Merton

“Dance. Smile. Giggle. Marvel. TRUST. HOPE. LOVE. WISH. BELIEVE. Most of all, enjoy every moment of the journey, and appreciate where you are at this moment instead of always focusing on how far you have to go.”

“there is a God, there always has been. I see him here, in the eyes of the people in this [hospital] corridor of desperation. This is the real house of God, this is where those who have lost God will find Him... there is a God, there has to be, and now I will pray, I will pray that He will forgive that I have neglected Him all of these years, forgive that I have betrayed, lied, and sinned with impunity only to turn to Him now in my hour of need. I pray that He is as merciful, benevolent, and gracious as His book says He is.”
― Khaled Hosseini

“The chief beauty about time
is that you cannot waste it in advance.
The next year, the next day, the next hour are lying ready for you,
as perfect, as unspoiled,
as if you had never wasted or misapplied
a single moment in all your life.
You can turn over a new leaf every hour
if you choose.”

“Faith does not eliminate questions. But faith knows where to take them.”
― Elisabeth Elliot, A Chance to Die: The Life and Legacy of Amy Carmichael

“You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.”
― Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values

― Mandy Hale, The Single Woman: Life, Love, and a Dash of Sass

“Have you ever noticed that when your mind is awakened or drawn to someone new, that person's name suddenly pops up everywhere you go? My friend Sophie calls it coincidence, and Mr. Simpless, my parson friend, calls it Grace. He thinks that if one cares deeply about someone or something new one throws a kind of energy out into the world, and "fruitfulness" is drawn in. ”

“This is one more piece of advice I have for you: don't get impatient. Even if things are so tangled up you can't do anything, don't get desperate or blow a fuse and start yanking on one particular thread before it's ready to come undone. You have to realize it's going to be a
long process and that you'll work on things slowly, one at a time.”
― Haruki Murakami, Norwegian Wood

“But there were some things I believed in. Some things I had faith in. And faith isn't about perfect attendance to services, or how much money you put on the little plate. It isn't about going skyclad to the Holy Rites, or meditating each day upon the divine.
Faith is about what you do. It's about aspiring to be better and nobler and kinder than you are. It's about making sacrifices for the good of others - even when there's not going to be anyone telling you what a hero you are.”
― Jim Butcher, Changes

“Persistence. Perfection. Patience. Power. Prioritize your passion. It keeps you sane.”
― Criss Jami, Killosophy

“For in grief nothing "stays put." One keeps on emerging from a phase, but it always recurs. Round and round. Everything repeats. Am I going in circles, or dare I hope I am on a spiral?

But if a spiral, am I going up or down it?

How often -- will it be for always? -- how often will the vast emptiness astonish me like a complete novelty and make me say, "I never realized my loss till this moment"? The same leg is cut off time after time.”
― C.S. Lewis, A Grief Observed

“When you are in troubled and worried and sick at heart
And your plans are upset and your world falls apart,
Remember God's ready and waiting to share

The burden you find much to heavy to bear--

So with faith, "Let Go and Let GOD" lead your way

Into a brighter and less troubled day”
― Helen Steiner Rice

“You were born a child of light’s wonderful secret— you return to the beauty you have always been.”
― Aberjhani, Visions of a Skylark Dressed in Black

“Life is such unutterable hell, solely because it is sometimes beautiful. If we could only be miserable all the time, if there could be no such things as love or beauty or faith or hope, if I could be absolutely certain that my love would never be returned: how much more simple life would be. One could plod through the Siberian salt mines of existence without being bothered about happiness. Unfortunately the happiness is there. There is always the chance (about eight hundred and fifty to one) that another heart will come to mine. I can't help hoping, and keeping faith, and loving beauty. Quite frequently I am not so miserable as it would be wise to be.”
― T.H. White, Ghostly, Grim and Gruesome

“When every hope is gone, 'when helpers fail and comforts flee,' I find that help arrives somehow, from I know not where. Supplication, worship, prayer are no superstition; they are acts more real than the acts of eating, drinking, sitting or walking. It is no exaggeration to say that they alone are real, all else is unreal.”

“You have as much laughter as you have faith.”
― Martin Luther

“A competitive and insecure woman will tell you that “true love” is never giving up on someone you're in love with. A confident and spiritual woman knows that “moving on” doesn’t mean you never loved someone. She realizes that letting go is what God needs her to do because both your happiness and hers requires taking different journeys for spiritual growth. Letting go is sometimes the hardest thing, but it is the most “real love” you will ever experience.”

“Don't you quit. You keep walking. You keep trying. There is help and happiness ahead. Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don’t come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come. It will be all right in the end. Trust God and believe in good things to come.”
― Jeffrey R. Holland

“Any faith that must be supported by the evidence of the senses is not real faith.”

― Christopher Hitchens, God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything

“The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ would take the slums out of people, and then they would take themselves out of the slums.
The world would mold men by changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature.”
― Ezra Taft Benson

“Don't you believe in flying saucers, they ask me? Don't you believe in telepathy? — in ancient astronauts? — in the Bermuda triangle? — in life after death?
No, I reply. No, no, no, no, and again no.
One person recently, goaded into desperation by the litany of unrelieved negation, burst out "Don't you believe in anything?"
Yes", I said. "I believe in evidence. I believe in observation, measurement, and reasoning, confirmed by independent observers. I'll believe anything, no matter how wild and ridiculous, if there is evidence for it. The wilder and more ridiculous something is, however, the firmer and more solid the evidence will have to be.”
― Isaac Asimov

“Most lives are not distinguished by great achievements. They are measured by an infinite number of small ones.

“Wait on the Lord" is a constant refrain in the Psalms, and it is a necessary word, for God often keeps us waiting. He is not in such a hurry as we are, and it is not his way to give more light on the future than we need for action in the present, or to guide us more than one step at a time. When in doubt, do nothing, but continue to wait on God. When action is needed, light will come.”

And sometimes - many times - my feelings are out of sync with the truth.

“Being in a hurry. Getting to the next thing without fully entering the thing in front of me. I cannot think of a single advantage I've ever gained from being in a hurry. But a thousand broken and missed things, tens of thousands, lie in the wake of all the rushing.... Through all that haste I thought I was making up time. It turns out I was throwing it away.”
― Ann Voskamp, One Thousand Gifts: A Dare to Live Fully Right Where You Are

― Graeme Rodaughan, The Dragon's Den

“Challenge a person's beliefs, and you challenge his dignity, standing, and power. And when those beliefs are based on nothing but faith, they are chronically fragile. No one gets upset about the belief that rocks fall down as opposed to up, because all sane people can see it with their own eyes. Not so for the belief that babies are born with original sin or that God exists in three persons or that Ali is the second-most divinely inspired man after Muhammad. When people organize their lives around these beliefs, and then learn of other people who seem to be doing just fine without them--or worse, who credibly rebut them--they are in danger of looking like fools. Since one cannot defend a belief based on faith by persuading skeptics it is true, the faithful are apt to react to unbelief with rage, and may try to eliminate that affront to everything that makes their lives meaningful.”
― Steven Pinker, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined

“I could not believe in a God that would challenge faith like this.”

“To have faith requires courage, the ability to take a risk, the readiness even to accept pain and disappointment. Whoever insists on safety and security as primary conditions of life cannot have faith; whoever shuts himself off in a system of defense, where distance and possession are his means of security, makes himself a prisoner. To be loved, and to love, need courage, the courage to judge certain values as of ultimate concern—and to take the jump and to stake everything on these values.”
― Erich Fromm, The Art of Loving

“There is something more powerful than any army. Something strong enough to topple kings, and even Darklings. Do you know what that thing is?”

بربك لمَ أبعدتني عنك ؟”

― David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas

“He showed me a sketch he'd drawn once during meditation. It was an androgynous human figure, standing up, hands clasped in prayer. But this figure had four legs, and no head. Where the head should have been, there was only a wild foliage of ferns and flowers. There was a small, smiling face drawn over the heart.
To find the balance you want," Ketut spoke through his translator, "this is what you must become. You must keep your feet grounded so firmly on the earth that it's like you have four legs, instead of two. That way, you can stay in the world. But you must stop looking at the world through your head. You must look through your heart, instead. That way, you will know God.”
― Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love

“We never know how God will answer our prayers, but we can expect that He will get us involved in His plan for the answer. If we are true intercessors, we must be ready to take part in God’s work on behalf of the people for whom we pray.”

― Joel Osteen, Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential

“I was a terrible believer in things,but I was also a terrible nonbeliever in things. I was as searching as I was skeptical. I didn't know where to put my faith,or if there was such a place,or even what the word faith meant, in all of it's complexity. Everything seemed to be possibly potent and possibly fake.”
― Cheryl Strayed, Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail

“You can feel the whole world and still feel lost in it. So many people are in pain-- no matter how smart or accomplished--they cry, they yearn, they hurt. But instead of looking down on things, they look up, which is where I should have been looking, too. Because when the world quiets to the sound of your own breathing, we all want the same things: comfort, love and a peaceful heart.”

“Although it is very easy to marry a wife, it is very difficult to support her along with the children and the household. Accordingly, no one notices this faith of Jacob. Indeed, many hate fertility in a wife for the sole reason that the offspring must be supported and brought up. For this is what they commonly say: ‘Why should I marry a wife when I am a pauper and a beggar? I would rather bear the burden of poverty alone and not load myself with misery and want.’ But this blame is unjustly fastened on marriage and fruitfulness. Indeed, you are indicting your unbelief by distrusting God’s goodness, and you are bringing greater misery upon yourself by disparaging God’s blessing. For if you had trust in God’s grace and promises, you would undoubtedly be supported. But because you do not hope in the Lord, you will never prosper.”
― Martin Luther, The Sermons of Martin Luther: 7 Volumes

“Shepherd Book: What are we up to, sweetheart?
River: Fixing your Bible.
Book: I, um... What?
River: Bible's broken. Contradictions, false logistics - doesn't make sense.
Shepherd Book: No, no. You-you-you can't...
River: So we'll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God's creation of Eden. Eleven inherent metaphoric parallels already there. Eleven. Important number. Prime number. One goes into the house of eleven eleven times, but always comes out one. Noah's ark is a problem.
Shepherd Book: Really?
River: We'll have to call it early quantum state phenomenon. Only way to fit 5000 species of mammal on the same boat.
Shepherd Book: River, you don't fix the Bible.
River: It's broken. It doesn't make sense.
Book: It's not about making sense. It's about believing in something, and letting that belief be real enough to change your life. It's about faith. You don't fix faith, River. It fixes you.”

“Faith is realizing that you always get what you need.”
― Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Celebrating Silence: Excerpts from Five Years of Weekly Knowledge 1995-2000

“While believing strongly, without evidence, is considered a mark of madness or stupidity in any other area of our lives, faith in God still holds immense prestige in our society. Religion is the one area of our discourse where it is considered noble to pretend to be certain about things no human being could possibly be certain about. It is telling that this aura of nobility extends only to those faiths that still have many subscribers. Anyone caught worshipping Poseidon, even at sea, will be thought insane.”

“The search for God is a reversal of the normal, mundane worldly order. In search for God, you revert from what attracts you and swim toward that which is difficult. You abandon your comforting and familiar habits with the hope (the mere hope!) that something greater will be offered you in return for what you have given up.. if we truly knew all the answers in advance as to the meaning of life and the nature of God and the destiny of our souls, our belief would not be a leap of faith and it would not be a courageous act of humanity; it would just be.. a prudent insurance policy.”

“There's a long road of suffering ahead of you. But don't lose courage. You've already escaped the gravest danger: selection. So now, muster your strength, and don't lose heart. We shall all see the day of liberation. Have faith in life. Above all else, have faith. Drive out despair, and you will keep death away from yourselves. Hell is not for eternity. And now, a prayer - or rather, a piece of advice: let there be comradeship among you. We are all brothers, and we are all suffering the same fate. The same smoke floats over all our heads. Help one another. It is the only way to survive.”

Art symbolises the meaning of our existence.”

“I want neither a terrorist spirituality that keeps me in a perpetual state of fright about being in right relationship with my heavenly Father nor a sappy spirituality that portrays God as such a benign teddy bear that there is no aberrant behavior or desire of mine that he will not condone.

“Addiction" might be the best word to explain the lostness that so deeply permeates society. Our addiction make us cling to what the world proclaims as the keys to self-fulfillment: accumulation of wealth and power; attainment of status and admiration; lavish consumption of food and drink, and sexual gratification without distinguishing between lust and love. These addictions create expectations that cannot but fail to satisfy our deepest needs. As long as we live within the world's delusions, our addictions condemn us to futile quests in "the distant country," leaving us to face an endless series of disillusionments while our sense of self remains unfulfilled. In these days of increasing addictions, we have wandered far away from our Father's home. The addicted life can aptly be designated a life lived in "a distant country." It is from there that our cry for deliverance rises up.”

“Depression is about anger, it is about anxiety, it is about character and heredity. But it is also about something that is in its way quite unique. It is the illness of identity, it is the illness of those who do not know where they fit, who lose faith in the myths they have so painstakenly created for themselves. [...] It is a plague - especially if you add in its various forms of expression, like alcoholism, anorexia, bulimia, drug addiction, compulsive behaviour of one kind or another. They're all the same things: attempts to avoid disappearance, or nothingness, or chaos.”
― Tim Lott, Scent Of Dried Roses

“Disbelief is more resistant than faith because it is sustained by the senses.”

“I know how much you grieve over those who are under your care: those you try to help and fail, those you cannot help. Have faith in God and remember that He will is His own way and in His own time complete what we so poorly attempt. Often we do not achieve for others the good that we intend but achieve something, something that goes on from our effort. Good is an overflow. Where we generously and sincerely intend it, we are engaged in a work of creation which may be mysterious even to ourselves - and because it is mysterious we may be afraid of it. But this should not make us draw back. God can always show us, if we will, a higher and a better way; and we can only learn to love by loving. Remember that all our failures are ultimately failures in love. Imperfect love must not be condemned and rejected but made perfect. The way is always forward, never back.”
― Iris Murdoch, The Bell

It is the song that the “morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy” at the creation of the world. (Job 38:7). It is the victory song of the children of Israel after passing through the Red Sea, the Magnificat of Mary after the annunciation, the song of Paul and Silas in the night of prison, the song of the singers on the sea of glass after their rescue, the “song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb” (Rev. 15:3) It is the song of the heavenly fellowship.”

“God whispered, "You endured a lot. For that I am truly sorry, but grateful. I needed you to struggle to help so many. Through that process you would grow into who you have now become. Didn't you know that I gave all my struggles to my favorite children? One only needs to look at the struggles given to your older brother Jesus to know how important you have been to me.”

“At such times, the heart of man turns instictively towards his Maker. In prosperity, and whenever there is nothing to injure or make him afraid, he remembers Him not, and is ready to defy Him; but place him in the midst of dangers, cut him off from human aid, let the grave open before him, then it is, in the time of his tribulation, that the scoffer and unbelieving man turns to God for help, feeling there is no other hope, or refuge, or safety, save in his protecting arm.”

“Gifts of grace come to all of us. But we must be ready to see and willing to receive these gifts. It will require a kind of sacrifice, the sacrifice of believing that, however painful our losses, life can still be good — good in a different way then before, but nevertheless good. I will never recover from my loss and I will never got over missing the ones I lost. But I still cherish life. . . . I will always want the ones I lost back again. I long for them with all my soul. But I still celebrate the life I have found because they are gone. I have lost, but I have also gained. I lost the world I loved, but I gained a deeper awareness of grace. That grace has enabled me to clarify my purpose in life and rediscover the wonder of the present moment.”

“Surrender is the ultimate sign of strength and the foundation for a spiritual life. Surrendering affirms that we are no longer willing to live in pain. It expresses a deep desire to transcend our struggles and transform our negative emotions. It commands a life beyond our egos, beyond that part of ourselves that is continually reminding us that we are separate, different and alone. Surrendering allows us to return to our true nature and move effortlessly through the cosmic dance called life. It's a powerful statement that proclaims the perfect order of the universe.

When you surrender your will, you are saying, "Even though things are not exactly how I'd like them to be, I will face my reality. I will look it directly in the eye and allow it to be here." Surrender and serenity are synonymous; you can't experience one without the other. So if it's serenity you're searching for, it's close by. All you have to do is resign as General Manager of the Universe. Choose to trust that there is a greater plan for you and that if you surrender, it will be unfolded in time.

Surrender is a gift that you can give yourself. It's an act of faith. It's saying that even though I can't see where this river is flowing, I trust it will take me in the right direction.”

“Faith is a great thing, and really religious people would like us to believe that faith and knowing are the same thing, but I don't believe that myself. Because there are too many different ideas on the subject. What we know is this: When we die, one of two things happens. Either our souls and thoughts somehow survive the experience of dying or they don't. If they do, that opens up every possibility you could think of. If they don't, it's just blotto. The end.”

What else?

“[The] insistence on the absolutely indiscriminate nature of compassion within the Kingdom is the dominant perspective of almost all of Jesus' teaching.
What is indiscriminate compassion? 'Take a look at a rose. Is is possible for the rose to say, "I'll offer my fragrance to good people and withhold it from bad people"? Or can you imagine a lamp that withholds its rays from a wicked person who seeks to walk in its light? It could do that only be ceasing to be a lamp. And observe how helplessly and indiscriminately a tree gives its shade to everyone, good and bad, young and old, high and low; to animals and humans and every living creature -- even to the one who seeks to cut it down. This is the first quality of compassion -- its indiscriminate character.' (Anthony DeMello, The Way to Love)...
What makes the Kingdom come is heartfelt compassion: a way of tenderness that knows no frontiers, no labels, no compartmentalizing, and no sectarian divisions.”

“Low self-esteem causes me to believe that I have so little worth that my response does not matter. With repentance, however, I understand that being worth so much to God is why my response is so important. Repentance is remedial work to mend our minds and hearts, which get bent by sin.”
― John Ortberg, The Me I Want to Be: Becoming God's Best Version of You

“[Y]ou have to stop loving and pursuing Christ in order to sin. When you are pursuing love, running toward Christ, you do not have opportunity to wonder, *Am I doing this right?* or *Did I serve enough this week?* When you are running toward Christ, you are freed up to serve, love, and give thanks without guilt, worry or fear. As long as you are running, you're safe.”

We do not rely solely upon science and reason, because these are necessary rather than sufficient factors, but we distrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason. We may differ on many things, but what we respect is free inquiry, openmindedness, and the pursuit of ideas for their own sake.”

“The human ego is the ugliest part of man. We lift up men who only show us darkness, and put down those brave enough to show us the light. Likewise, people engage in darkness when it is light outside, and acknowledge the light only when it is dark. We abandon those fighting for us to cheer behind those fighting against us. And, we only remember good people and God when it is convenient for us, and take them for granted because their doors are always open - only to chase after closed doors and personalities void of substance and truth.”

“Nobody can turn you into a slave unless you allow them. Nobody can make you afraid of anything, unless you allow them. Nobody can tell you to do something wrong, unless you allow them.

So why is man your god, and not the Creator?”

انه يتوجب ان نحيا من اجل هدف او شيء ما عزيز علينا ونموت من اجله، سواء كان هذا الهدف او الشيء مبدأ سياسي او خطة حياتية او أمة او

“Reason excludes faith," Alessandro responded, watching the blood-red mite as it made a dash for the rim. "It's deliberately limited. It won't function with the materials of religion. You can come close to proving the existence of God by reason, but you can't do it absolutely. That's because you can't do anything absolutely by reason. That's because reason depends on postulates. Postulates defy proof and yet they are essential to reason. God is a postulate. I don't think God is interested in the verification of His existence, and, therefore, neither am I. Anyway, I have professional reasons to believe. Nature and art pivot faithfully around God. Even dogs know that.”

“BLACK AND WHITE


I was born into
A religion of Light,
But with so many other
Religions and
Philosophies,
How do I know which
ONE
Is right?

Is it not
My birthright
To seek out the light?
To find Truth
After surveying all the proof,
Am I supposed
To love
Or fight?
And why do all those who
Try to guide me,
Always start by dividing
And multiplying me –
From what they consider
Wrong or right?
I thought,
There were no walls
For whoever beams truth and light.
And how can one speak on Light's behalf,
lf all they do
Is act black,
But talk WHITE?”
― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem

“A human being always acts and feels and performs in accordance with what he imagines to be true about himself and his environment...For imagination sets the goal ‘picture’ which our automatic mechanism works on.

“We see them as they cannot, will not, see each other--we see his heart in the way he looks at her; we see her soul calling out for his every touch. It would be so easy if they could only see inside each other as we can.

And yet, there is beauty in the way they find each other: slowly, in a fragile dance of sidelong glances and accidental touches. To see them come together, souls binding without knowing each other as we do, without being certain of what the other's heart holds, is to learn something new...

Faith.”

“My friend Adele describes fundamentalism as holding so tightly to your beliefs that your fingernails leave imprints on the palm of your hand... I think she's right.

“Because salvation is by grace through faith, I believe that among the countless number of people standing in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palms in their hands (see Revelation 7:9), I shall see the prostitute from the Kit-Kat Ranch in Carson City, Nevada, who tearfully told me that she could find no other employment to support her two-year-old son. I shall see the woman who had an abortion and is haunted by guilt and remorse but did the best she could faced with grueling alternatives; the businessman besieged with debt who sold his integrity in a series of desperate transactions; the insecure clergyman addicted to being liked, who never challenged his people from the pulpit and longed for unconditional love; the sexually abused teen molested by his father and now selling his body on the street, who, as he falls asleep each night after his last 'trick', whispers the name of the unknown God he learned about in Sunday school.

'But how?' we ask.

Then the voice says, 'They have washed their robes and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb.'

There they are. There *we* are - the multitude who so wanted to be faithful, who at times got defeated, soiled by life, and bested by trials, wearing the bloodied garments of life's tribulations, but through it all clung to faith.

“To ignore, repress, or dismiss our feelings is to fail to listen to the stirrings of the Spirit within our emotional life. Jesus listened. In John's Gospel we are told that Jesus was moved with the deepest emotions (11:33)... The gospel portrait of the beloved Child of Abba is that of a man exquisitely attuned to His emotions and uninhibited in expressing them. The Son of Man did not scorn of reject feelings as fickle and unreliable. They were sensitive antennae to which He listened carefully and through which He perceived the will of His Father for congruent speech and action.”

“As we come to grips with our own selfishness and stupidity, we make friends with the impostor and accept that we are impoverished and broken and realize that, if we were not, we would be God.

“Too much faith is the worst ally. When you believe in something literally, through your faith you'll turn it into something absurd. One who is a genuine adherent, if you like, of some political outlook, never takes its sophistries seriously, but only its practical aims, which are concealed beneath these sophistries. Political rhetoric and sophistries do not exist, after all, in order that they be believed; rather, they have to serve as a common and agreed upon alibi. Foolish people who take them in earnest sooner or later discover inconsistencies in them, begin to protest, and finish finally and infamously as heretics and apostates. No, too much faith never brings anything good...”
― Milan Kundera

“In her way, she was a hard one. Faith in any sort of natural justice was nothing but a night light; she knew of that. Whatever she did, she would end the same way with everyone does: flat on her back with a tube in her nose, wondering, "Is this all?”
― Thomas Harris, Red Dragon

“Managing stress is about controlling the way you respond to events and having an open mind about the things that stress you. Learn to talk to God during the day and ask Him to give you peace and to help you with your problems”

“Lihat, ini Arok, yang tetap mempertahankan Tumapel. Dia dan pasukannya akan mempertahankannya sampai titik darah terakhir. Bukan karena imbalan uang, emas dan perak dan singgasana. Hanya karena kesetiaan pada janji.”
― Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Arok Dedes

“Devotion is diligence without assurance. Faith is a way of saying, 'Yes, I pre-accept the terms of the universe and I am voicing in advance what I am presently incapable of understanding.' There is a reason that we refer to leaps-of-faith, because the decision to consent to any notion of divinity is a mighty jump from the rational over to the unknowable, and I don't care how diligently scholars of every religion will try to sit you down with their stacks of books and prove that their faith is rational; it isn't. If they were rational, it wouldn't be - by definition - faith. Faith is belief in what you cannot see or prove or touch. Faith is walking face first and full speed into the dark.”
― Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love

“And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.”

“He can heal me. I believe He will. I believe I'm going to be an old surely Baptist preacher. And even if He doesn't...that's the thing: I've read Philippians 1. I know what Paul says. I'm here let's work, if I go home? That's better. I understand that.”
― Matt Chandler

“Faith is like love: it does not let itself be forced.”

“Anyone who is having troubles should pray. Anyone who is happy should sing praises. Anyone who is sick should call the church's elders. They should pray for and pour oil on the person in the name of the Lord. And the prayer that is said with faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will heal that person. And if the person has sinned, the sins will be forgiven. Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so God can heal you. When a believing person prays, great things happen. (James 5:13-16)”

― Colleen McCullough, The Thorn Birds

“Mr. Langdon, I did not ask if you believe what man says about God. I asked if you believed in God. There is a difference. Holy scripture is stories...legends and history of man's quest to understand his own need for meaning. I am not asking you to pass judgment on literature. I am asking if you believe in God. When you lie out under the stars, do you sense the divine? Do you feel in your gut that you are staring up at the work of God's hands?”
― Dan Brown, Angels & Demons

“They said that I should lose my ideals and begin to believe in the methods of practical politicians. Now, I have not lost my ideals in the least; my faith in fundamentals is exactly what it always was. What I have lost is my childlike faith in practical politics.”

“It is not easy to convey a sense of wonder, let alone resurrection wonder, to another. It’s the very nature of wonder to catch us off guard, to circumvent expectations and assumptions. Wonder can’t be packaged, and it can’t be worked up. It requires some sense of being there and some sense of engagement.”

“As Emmanuel, Cardinal Suhard says, "To be a witness does not consist in engaging in propaganda, nor even in stirring people up, but in being a living mystery. It means to live in such a way that one's life would not make sense if God did not exist.”

“هل تعلمين أن الناس لا يعرفون عنا سوى نهاياتنا ؟عندما نموت ,نصبح رمزًا للجهاد والمقاومة. والرمز لا حياة شخصية لديه ولا احتياجات, لديه هدف فقط , من أجله يعيش ومن أجله يموت, بهذا المعنى نكون "مخلوقات ظل" تهفوا إلى "النور" نكون قد عبرنا إلى منطقة النور حين نستشهد. كينونتنا منذ زمن هي كينونة هذا "الرمز" كل نفس يتردد في صدورنا هو في سبيل الله. فكيف نعود إلى حياة البشر الفانين؟ نحيا لنأكل ونقرأ ونتفسح وننام .. لنعيد الكرة في اليوم التالي "التكرار" تلك الكلمة المقيتة. أليس التكرار هو طابع جهنم؟ جسد يحترق ثم يُكسَى لحمًا ليحترق مرة أخرى كأن شيئًا لم يكن؟”

― Liz Curtis Higgs, Here Burns My Candle

“It is argued that because they believed thoroughly in a just, moral God they could put there faith there and let the smaller insecurities take care of themselves. But I think that because they trusted themselves and respected themselves as individuals, because they knew beyond doubt that they were valuable and potential moral units- because of this they could give God their own courage and dignity and then receive it back. Such things have disappeared perhaps because men do not trust themselves anymore, and when that happens there is nothing left except perhaps to find some strong sure man, even though he may be wrong, and to dangle from his coat-tails.”
― John Steinbeck, East of Eden

“Believe more deeply. Hold your face up to the light,even though for the moment you do not see.”

“I am thankful when I am hungry because then I know that when I eat, the food will taste better. Life has taught me that my true contentment rests in hope, and the pleasure itself is secondary. It is self-awareness, not happiness, that maintains peace.”
― Criss Jami, Killosophy

“I asked myself what I believed. I had never prayed a lot. I hoped hard, wished hard, but I didn't pray. I had developed a certain distrust of organised religion growing up, but I felt I had the capacity to be a spiritual person, and to hold some fervent beliefs. Quite simply, I believed I had a responsibility to be a good person, and that meant fair, honest, hardworking and honorable. If I did that, if I was good to my family, true to my friends, if I gave back to my community or to some cause, if I wasn't a liar, a cheat, or a thief, then I believed that should be enough. At the end of the day, if there was indeed some Body or presence standing there to judge me, I hoped I would be judged on whether I had lived a true life, not on whether I believed in a certain book, or whether I'd been baptised.”

― Criss Jami, Killosophy

“What I have a problem with is not so much religion or god, but faith. When you say you believe something in your heart and therefore you can act on it, you have completely justified the 9/11 bombers. You have justified Charlie Manson. If it's true for you, why isn't it true for them? Why are you different? If you say "I believe there's an all-powerful force of love in the universe that connects us all, and I have no evidence of that but I believe it in my heart," then it's perfectly okay to believe in your heart that Sharon Tate deserves to die. It's perfectly okay to believe in your heart that you need to fly planes into buildings for Allah.”
― Penn Jillette

“Faith gives you an inner strength and a sense of balance and perspective in life.”

“The sorrow of God lies in our fear of Him, our fear of life, and our fear of ourselves. He anguishes over our self-absorption and self-sufficiency... God's sorrow lies in our refusal to approach Him when we sinned and failed.”

“I've always been bad. Probably I shall be bad again, punished again. But the worse I am, the more I need God. I can't shut myself out from His mercy. ...

“The goal of prayer is to live all of my life and speak all of my words in the joyful awareness of the presence of God.
Prayer becomes real when we grasp the reality and goodness of God's constant presence with 'the real me.' Jesus lived his everyday life in conscious awareness of his Father.”
― John Ortberg, The Me I Want to Be: Becoming God's Best Version of You

“Ask and it shall be given you,'" I began. "'Seek and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you; For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.' We have the same message in the Book of Saint John," I said, sounding for all the world like a preacher...."
Well, but how could I just stop there? Those words were worse than nothing if I didn't tell what they meant to Grandpa. Looking at the long rough box, I spoke timid, in a mumbled voice. Not preachified at all. "Grandpa didn't think Jesus meant, by that, that we should ast God for things, or for special favors. He said we could trust that in the nature of things, without astin', we'll get lots of blessin's and happy surprises and maybe a miracle or two. When Jesus said ast and you'll get it, He meant things of the spirit, not the flesh. Right now for instance, I could ast, 'Lord please raise Grandpa from the dead,' but it wouldn't happen. But I can say, 'Please, God, comfort me,' and I'll get heart's ease. Grandpa said Jesus meant us to ast for hope, forgiveness, and all that. Ast, 'Hep us not be scared, hep us not be greedy, give us courage to try." I was really carried away. "Ast any such and God will give it to you. But don't ast Him not to let fire burn, or say spare me from death. At least, uh, that's what Grandpa said.”
― Olive Ann Burns, Cold Sassy Tree

“The nature of the enemy's warfare in your life is to cause you to become discouraged and to cast away your confidence. Not that you would necessarily discard your salvation, but you could give up your hope of God's deliverance. The enemy wants to numb you into a coping kind of Christianity that has given up hope of seeing God's resurrection power.”

“Although, I admit, I desire,
Occasionally, some backtalk
From the mute sky, I can't honestly complain:
A certain minor light may still
Lean incandescent

Out of kitchen table or chair
As if a celestial burning took
Possession of the most obtuse objects now and then -- ”
― Sylvia Plath, The Collected Poems

“The geometry of judgment is a circle. Hate is a snake that turns to consume itself from the tail, a circle that diminishes to a point, then to nothing. Pride is such a snake, and envy, and greed. Love, however, is a hoop, a wheel, that rolls on forever. We are rescued by those whom we have rescued. The saved become the saviors of their saviors.”
― Dean Koontz, The Darkest Evening of the Year

“The worse I am, the more I need God. I can't shut myself out from His mercy. That is what it would mean; starting a life with you, without Him.”

“To my mind, faith is like being in the sun. When you are in the sun, can you avoid creating a shadow? Can you shake that area of darkness that clings to you, always shaped like you, as if constantly to remind you of yourself? You can’t. This shadow is doubt. And it goes wherever you go as long as you stay in the sun. And who wouldn’t want to be in the sun?”

“To truly try means to accept God's love, his healing, to accept the world can be ugly, but your heart doesn't have to be. It takes courage, Finley the warrior.

“I will tell you why we have these extraordinary minds and souls, Miss Whittaker," he continued, as though he had not heard her. "We have them because there is a supreme intelligence in the universe, which wishes for communion with us. This supreme intelligence longs to be known. It calls out to us. It draws us close to its mystery, and grants us these remarkable minds, in order that we try to reach for it. It wants us to find it. It wants union with us, more than anything.”

“I'm not a Wiccan. I'm not big on churches of any kind, despite the fact that I've spoken, face-to-face, with an archangel of the Almighty.

But there were some things I believed in. Some things I had faith in. And faith isn't about perfect attendance to services, or how much money you put on the little plate. It isn't about going skyclad to the Holy Rites, or meditating each day upon the divine.

Faith is about what you do. It's about aspiring to be better and nobler and kinder than you are. It's about making sacrifices for the good of others--even when there's not going to be anyone telling you what a hero you are.

Faith is a power of its own, and one even more elusive and difficult to define than magic.”

“I love to walk. Walking is a spiritual journey and a reflection of living.

“A family in my sister's neighborhood was recently stricken with a double tragedy, when both the young mother and her three-year-old son were diagnosed with cancer. When Catherine told me about this, I could only say, shocked, "Dear God, that family needs grace." She replied firmly, "That family needs casseroles," and proceeded to organize the entire neighborhood into bringing that family dinner, in shifts, every single night, for an entire year. I do not know if my sister fully recognizes that this IS grace.”
― Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love

“Omnipotent-benevolent simply means that God is all-powerful and well-meaning.'
'I understand the concept. It's just . . . there seems to be a contradiction.'
'Yes. The contradiction is pain. Man's starvation, war, sickness . . .'
'Exactly!' Chartrand knew the camerlengo would understand. 'Terrible things happen in this world. Human tragedy seems like proof that God could not possibly be both all-powerful and well-meaning. If He loves us and has the power to change our situation, He would prevent our pain, wouldn't He?'
The camerlengo frowned. 'Would He?'
Chartrand felt uneasy. Had he overstepped his bounds? Was this one of those religious questions you just didn't ask? 'Well . . . if God loves us, and He can protect us, He would have to. It seems He is either omnipotent and uncaring, or benevolent and powerless to help.'
'Do you have children, Lieutenant?'
Chartrand flushed. 'No, signore.'
'Imagine you had an eight-year-old son . . . would you love him?'
'Of course.'
'Would you let him skateboard?'
Chartrand did a double take. The camerlengo always seemed oddly "in touch" for a clergyman. 'Yeah, I guess,' Chartrand said. 'Sure, I'd let him skateboard, but I'd tell him to be careful.'
'So as this child's father, you would give him some basic, good advice and then let him go off and make his own mistakes?'
'I wouldn't run behind him and mollycoddle him if that's what you mean.'
'But what if he fell and skinned his knee?'
'He would learn to be more careful.'
The camerlengo smiled. 'So although you have the power to interfere and prevent your child's pain, you would choose to show your love by letting him learn his own lessons?'
'Of course. Pain is part of growing up. It's how we learn.'
The camerlengo nodded. 'Exactly.”
― Dan Brown, Angels & Demons

“Faith—is the Pierless Bridge
Supporting what We see
Unto the Scene that We do not—
Too slender for the eye
It bears the Soul as bold
As it were rocked in Steel
With Arms of Steel at either side—
It joins—behind the Veil
To what, could We presume
The Bridge would cease to be
To Our far, vacillating Feet
A first Necessity.”
― Emily Dickinson

“Mithorden said it well," she said finally. "It's worshipping death. They say they follow light. But, in the end, they're really following desolation, division, the end of things.

Worse, she wondered to what ends people who believed these things would go to assert their views.”

“When you let go of control and commit yourself to happiness, it is so easy to offer compassion and forgiveness. This propels you from the past, into the present. People that are negative, spend so much time trying to control situations and blame others for their problems. Committing yourself to staying positive is a daily mantra that states, “I have control over how I plan to react, feel, think and believe in the present. No one guides the tone of my life, except me!”

“Faith, hope and charity go together. Hope is practised through the virtue of patience, which continues to do good even in the face of apparent failure, and through the virtue of humility, which accepts God's mystery and trusts him even at times of darkness. Faith tells us that God has given his Son for our sakes and gives us the victorious certainty that it is really true: God is love! It thus transforms our impatience and our doubts into the sure hope that God holds the world in his hands and that, as the dramatic imagery of the end of the Book of Revelation points out, in spite of all darkness he ultimately triumphs in glory. Faith, which sees the love of God revealed in the pierced heart of Jesus on the Cross, gives rise to love. Love is the light—and in the end, the only light—that can always illuminate a world grown dim and give us the courage needed to keep living and working. Love is possible, and we are able to practise it because we are created in the image of God. To experience love and in this way to cause the light of God to enter into the world—this is the invitation I would like to extend with the present Encyclical.”
― Pope Benedict XVI (Joseph Ratzinger), God Is Love: Deus Caritas Est

“He had in those days imagined himself capable of extraordinary heroisms and endurances which would make the girl he loved forget the awkward hands and the spotty chin of adolescence. Everything had seemed possible. One could laugh at daydreams, but so long as you had the capacity to daydream there was a chance that you might develop some of the qualities of which you dreamed. It was like the religious discipline: words however emptily repeated can in time form a habit, a kind of unnoticed sediment at the bottom of the mind, until one day to your own surprise you find yourself acting on the belief you thought you didn't believe in.”
― Graham Greene, The Ministry of Fear

“In essence I find that the foundation of modern conservatism is driven by a clinging to God in fear of the world, whereas the foundation of modern liberalism is a clinging to the world in fear of God; albeit, the true foundation should be one's clinging to God in fear of God.”

“I love you,” was his reply. “I make myself keep on loving you, despite what you do. I've got to love you. We all have to love you, and believe in
you, and think you are looking out for our best interests. But look at us, Momma, and really see us.”
― V.C. Andrews, Flowers in the Attic

“Grace will follow us even when we are going the wrong way”
― Ricky Maye, An Emerging Spirituality

“A common mistake we make is that we look for God in places where we ourselves wish to find him, yet even in the physical reality this is a complete failure. For example, if you lost your car keys, you would not search where you want to search, you would search where you must in order to find them.”
― Criss Jami, Killosophy

“We can't believe what we believe to be untrue, and we can't love what we believe to be unreal.”
― Peter Kreeft, Pocket Handbook of Christian Apologetics

“The test of faith is whether I can make space for difference. Can I recognize God's image in someone who is not in my image, who language, faith, ideal, are different from mine? If I cannot, then I have made God in my image instead of allowing him to remake me in his.”
― Jonathan Sacks, The Dignity of Difference: How to Avoid the Clash of Civilizations

“Christianity is not about how much faith you have. Its about Who your faith is in.”
― Mike Donahey

“REFLECTIONS OF TRUTH

Where you find Truth
Is where you find your reflection
And where you find your reflection
Is where you find love
And where you find love
Is where you find light
And where you find light
Is where you find faith
And where you find faith
Is where you find purpose
And where you find purpose
Is where you find happiness
And where you find happiness
Is where you find Truth
And when you find Truth
Truth will set you free.”

“Some people are angels sent to you by God at your weakest moments.”
― Megan Wilson

“In all important transactions of life we have to take a leap in the dark.... If we decide to leave the riddles unanswered, that is a choice; if we waver in our answer, that, too, is a choice: but whatever choice we make, we make it at our peril. If a man chooses to turn his back altogether on God and the future, no one can prevent him; no one can show beyond reasonable doubt that he is mistaken. If a man thinks otherwise and acts as he thinks, I do not see that any one can prove that he is mistaken. Each must act as he thinks best; and if he is wrong, so much the worse for him. We stand on a mountain pass in the midst of whirling snow and blinding mist through which we get glimpses now and then of paths which may be deceptive. If we stand still we shall be frozen to death. If we take the wrong road we shall be dashed to pieces. We do not certainly know whether there is any right one. What must we do? ' Be strong and of a good courage.' Act for the best, hope for the best, and take what comes. . . . If death ends all, we cannot meet death better.”
― James Fitzjames Stephen, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity

“Perhaps there is supranatural: reason beyond the normal definitions of fact or data-based logic; something that only makes sense if you can see a bigger picture of reality. Maybe that is where faith fits in.”
― Wm. Paul Young, The Shack

“* نجلاء ..
نجلااااء ...
نجلااااااااء ... .
- الساعة الآن التاسعة صباحاً إنهضي
وإنفضي عن وسادتكِ رذاذ الأحلام ،
كان هذا صوتها أمي لتفيقني من ذاك
الحلم الذي كنت أهذي به كل ليلة !
تمنيت حينها لو أصيبت ذاكرتي بغيبوبة عن
واقع لا يحتويه ،
عن واقع لا يعانق وجوده !
أفقت وكعادتي أمضي إلى طريق مجهول
ومسافات غريبة أحمل حقائب أحلامي
وأجمع بها لوحاتي وأمل أتسكع به
على دهاليز مدينتي الباريسية !”

“Concerning the Gods, there are those who deny the very existence of the Godhead; others say that it exists, but neither bestirs nor concerns itself not has forethought far anything. A third party attribute to it existence and forethought, but only for great and heavenly matters, not for anything that is on earth. A fourth party admit things on earth as well as in heaven, but only in general, and not with respect to each individual. A fifth, of whom were Ulysses and Socrates, are those that cry: --
I move not without Thy knowledge!”
― Epictetus

“Loss is only temporary when you believe in God!”

“სამხრეთის კედელზე მაცხოვრის ერთადერტი თვალდახრილი და სახედაფხეკილი ფრესკის ქვეშ ვიღაც ლაზღანდარა ათეისტს მუშაირა ჰქონდა გამართული თვითონ მაცხოვართან.
უცხვირპირო და უთვალო,
როგორ გიწამო, უფალო?!-
კომკავშირელი ათეისტი. ასე აწერდა ხელს ლექსის ატორი. ცოტა ქვევით უფლის პასუხი იყო, ასევე ლურსმნით ამოკაწრული:
კომკავშირელო, თუ არ გწამს,
სახარება და ღმერთიო,
ამ სიმაღლეზე მეორედ,
გთხოვ, აღარ ამოეთრიო!-
იესო ქრისტე. ასე აწერდა ხელს პასუხის ავტორი.”

“True devotion and humility is when you carelessly allow yourself to fall in love with things you consider will make you look inferior, which in essence, makes you superior.”
― Michael Bassey Johnson

“But we have seen how brightly light shines in the dark, how sweetly music fills the quiet. All these years you have known only shadow and silence, and we have so much to show you. To save you.

I am not worth saving.

We are all worth saving.

How can you know?

We cannot ever know, not truly.

But we have faith.”
― Amie Kaufman, Their Fractured Light

“JUST BECAUSE A BUNCH OF ATHEISTS ARE BETTER WRITERS THAN THE GUYS WHO WROTE THE BIBLE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE THEM RIGHT!" [Owen Meany] said crossly. "LOOK AT THOSE WEIRDO TV MIRACLE-WORKERS--THEY'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN MAGIC! BUT THE REAL MIRACLES AREN'T ANYTHING YOU CAN SEE--THEY'RE THINGS YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE WITHOUT SEEING. IF SOME PREACHER'S AN ASSHOLE, THAT'S NOT PROOF THAT GOD DOESN'T EXIST!”
― John Irving, A Prayer for Owen Meany

“The truth is that we don't want to be saved by in the way God has chosen; we want to keep absolute control over our every step, to be fully conscious of our decisions, to be capable of choosing the object of our devotion. It isn't like that with love - it arrives, moves in, and starts directing everything.”
― Paulo Coelho, The Witch of Portobello

“Never doubt God in the darkness what he has given us in the light.”
― Francine Rivers, A Voice in the Wind

“I'm only a tool, beloved. Not your Savior”
― Francine Rivers, Redeeming Love

“We don't look at the stars in the universe and say how tragic they are, how bruised they are, even though that is what they are. We look at them and speak of the beauty they contain. The inspiration they give us. Even though stars are the scars of the universe we don't see them as these broken pieces of gaseous matter, we see them as these majestic astrological blessings that give hope to billions. What if you saw yourself in that same light, or better yet what if you saw others in a similar way.”
― Ricky Maye, Barefoot Christianity

“On every level of life, from housework to heights of prayer, in all judgment and efforts to get things done, hurry and impatience are sure marks of the amateur.”

“How do you know it'll be pleasurable?" He got on the bed and lay down.

Breath a whisper, she came closer and tied one wrist to the headboard. The cat growled but didn't try to make him wrench free.

"Because just looking at you gives me the most extreme pleasure I've ever felt."

"Christ, baby, tie me up before you start talking like that.”

― Shannon L. Alder

“But what of faith? What of fidelity and loyalty? Complete trust? Faith is not granted by tangible proof. It comes from the heart and the soul. If a person needs proof of god's existence, then the very notion of spirituality is diminished into sensuality and we have reduced what is holy into what is logical.-Drizzt Do'urden”
― R.A. Salvatore, Siege of Darkness

وأبواب فقدي لك مؤصدة ،

ولم تجده ؟ وبحثت عن هداياي من بين هداياهم ولم تصلك”

“Elder mocked me for praying once, and i spent an hour berating him for that. He ended up throwing up his hands, laughing, and telling me i could believe whatever i wanted if i was going to hold onto my beliefs so hard.”
― Beth Revis, A Million Suns

“Well, see, I think it's that most people don't like that lonely feeling. People don't like looking up and feeling small or lost. That's what I think prayer is all about. It doesn't matter which stories they believe in, they're all doing the same thing, kind of casting a line out to outer space, like there's something out there to connect to. It's like people make themselves part of something bigger that way, and maybe it makes them less afraid.”
― Craig Silvey, Jasper Jones

“A phenomenon often seen. A sceptic adhering to a believer; that is as simple as the law of the complementary colours. What we lack attracts us. Nobody loves the light like the blind man...”

Maybe that's the only way i am destined to keep it.”
― Anjum Choudhary

“I say to myself: "Who are you to measure infinite power?”

“God is so immense that if he were 'too visible,' people would give forced compliance without expressing their heart. So God made it possible, in enormous love, for us to live as if he were not there.”

“He is cured by faith who is sick of fate.”
― James Joyce, Finnegans Wake

“On the subject of who is to blame for our disunity - “The easy conclusion- that
the devil is at work trying to destroy the church- is true, but itʼs not the whole story. Of
course the enemy is at work doing that. But closer examination shows that much of
the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the church itself-on believers in god-and
how our own devilish deeds have alienated other followers of God. Sadly, weʼve done
the devilʼs work for him.”
― Ed Galisewski

“Faith, in its most correct form, never removes responsibility; it removes fear of responsibility. The results are complete opposites with the greater saying, 'God's will is my delight.”
― Criss Jami, Killosophy

“We live by revelation, as Christians, as artists, which means we must be careful never to get set into rigid molds. The minute we begin to think we know all the answers, we forget the questions, and we become smug like the Pharisee who listed all his considerable virtues, and thanked God that he was not like other men.

Unamuno might be describing the artist as well as the Christian as he writes, "Those who believe they believe in God, but without passion in the heart, without anguish of mind, without uncertainty, without doubt, and even at times without despair, believe only in the idea of God, and not in God himself.”
― Madeleine L'Engle, Walking on Water: Reflections on Faith and Art

“Science only goes so far, then comes God.
- Noah Calhoun-”
― Nicholas Sparks, The Notebook

“The desire for a strong faith is not the proof of a strong faith, rather the opposite. If one has it one may permit oneself the beautiful luxury of skepticism: one is secure enough, fixed enough for it.”
― Friedrich Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols

“My lack of faith in God is not a dilapidated house.
It does not need to be razed to the ground or burned down to cinders.
I refuse to be the wounded woman on a cross
that you crucify with your disapproval like nails;
I will only be the woman who believes in thunderstorms
the same way lightning loves the tops of trees it strikes
every time it gets tired of being pent up in an unforgiving sky,
the only difference is that I believe these are natural weather phenomenons,
not God’s belly rumbling or synapses firing.
When my doorway is filled with groups of people
wielding religious conversion pamphlets like crossbows,
I will be the martyr who steps aside to let the arrows
crack through the plaster in my wall instead of piercing my chest.
This is not a eulogy to the believer I could have been.
This is a battle cry to the believer I always have been,
believer in sunsets like splashes of paint, handholding
like willow branches brushing one another, new mornings
after old nights spent drowning in despair, believer
in love as an entire language instead of a single word.
Just because my beliefs align themselves on a different spectrum
does not mean they are the wrong wavelength or color.
And even though I think the universe was created by the Big Bang
instead of a God with magic dust shooting from his fingertips,
my universe does not contain fewer stars.”
― Meggie Royer

“Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things, never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation.”
― Joseph Smith

“Interestingly, God's remedy for Elijah's depression was not a refresher course in theology but food and sleep... Before God spoke to him at all, Elijah was fed twice and given a good chance to sleep. Only then, and very gently, did God confront him with his error. This is always God's way. Having made us as human beings, He respects our humanness and treats us with integrity. That is, He treats us true to the truth of who we are. It is human beings and not God who have made spirituality impractical.”
― Os Guinness, God in the Dark: The Assurance of Faith Beyond a Shadow of Doubt

“The truth of our faith becomes a matter of ridicule among the infidels if any Catholic, not gifted with the necessary scientific learning, presents as dogma what scientific scrutiny shows to be false.”
― St. Thomas Aquinas

“Out of the cacophony of random suffering and chaos that can mark human life, the life artist sees or creates a symphony of meaning and order. A life of wholeness does not depend on what we experience. Wholeness depends on how we experience our lives.”
― Archbishop Desmond Tutu

― Yevgeny Zamyatin, We

“We all go through hard times in life. It’s a part of being alive and it's the reality we all have to deal with. There are times we forget our value as a person because we are so blinded with these thoughts of loneliness, emptiness and ego. Somewhere along the road we become numbed with all the frustrations and dissatisfaction. But life itself isn't always about darkness and sadness, Life is also filled with colors and that makes it beautiful. Along this path of darkness there's always light waiting to be seen by our daunted hearts. Our heart is gifted to see this light. It may be hiding behind those circumstances that we encounter; in a stranger we just met at an unexpected place; a family who has been always there but you just ignored because of your imperfect relationship with them; it might be a long time friend you have or a friend you just met. Open your heart and you will see how blessed you are to have them all in your life. Sometimes they are the light that shines your path in some dark phases of life. Don't lose hope”
― Chanda Kaushik

“We are not sheep or cows. God didn’t create fences for us or boundaries to contain our nationalities. Man did. God didn’t draw up religious barriers to separate us from each other. Man did. And on top of that, no father would like to see his children fighting or killing each other. The Creator favors the man who spreads loves over the man who spreads hate. A religious title does not make anyone more superior over another. If a kind man stands by his conscience and exhibits truth in his words and actions, he will stand by God regardless of his faith. If mankind wants to evolve, we must learn from our past mistakes. If not, our technology will evolve without us.”
― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem

“The problem with certainty is that it is static; it can do little but endlessly reassert itself. Uncertainty, by contrast, is full of unknowns, possibilities, and risks. (65)”
― Stephen Batchelor, Confession of a Buddhist Atheist

“What is seen is not the Truth
What is cannot be said
Trust comes not without seeing
Nor understanding without words
The wise comprehends with knowledge
To the ignorant it is but a wonder
Some worship the formless God
Some worship his various forms
In what way He is beyond these attributes
Only the Knower knows
That music cannot be written
How can then be the notes
Say Kabir, awareness alone will overcome illusion.”
― Kabir

“O Diabo, invejoso, fez o homem confundir fé com religião e amor com casamento.”
― Machado de Assis

“I used to think mercy meant showing kindness to someone who didn't deserve it, as if only the recipient defined the act. The girl in between has learned that mercy is defined by its giver. Our flaws are obvious, yet we are loved and able to love, if we choose, because there is that bit of the divine still smoldering in us.”
― Susan Meissner, The Shape of Mercy

“He must trust, and he must have faith. And so he builds, because what is building, and rebuilding and rebuilding again, but an act of faith?”
― Dave Eggers

“You push the TRUTH off a cliff, but it will always fly. You can submerge the TRUTH under water, but it will not drown. You can place the TRUTH in the fire, but it will survive. You can bury the TRUTH beneath the ground, but it will arise. TRUTH always prevails!”
― Amaka Imani Nkosazana, Heart Crush

“George MacDonald gives me renewed strength during times of trouble--times when I have seen people tempted to deny God--when he says, "The Son of God suffered unto death, not that men might not suffer, but that their sufferings might be like his.”
― Madeleine L'Engle, Walking on Water: Reflections on Faith and Art

“God wants to dance with us. The goal of dancing is NOT to learn the steps. The goal of dancing is to enjoy your partner. We learn the steps but only so we don't have to look down at our feet. We are free to look into the eyes of the one we love.”
― Nicole Johnson, Fresh Brewed Life: A Stirring Invitation to Wake Up Your Soul

“Now how can anybody look at that and not believe in God? I mean, how can anybody look at this and not believe there is some higher power, some divine force at work in the universe greater than Man, some god that created it, that created all this, that created us?”

“faith gaped at him"how the hell did you do this?"

He looked at her as if she'd asked the dumbest question in history. "I'm brilliant.”
― Dianne Sylvan, Queen of Shadows

“Holiness is the strength of the soul. It comes by faith and through obedience to God's laws and ordinances. God then purifies the heart by faith, and the heart becomes purged from that which is profane and unworthy. When holiness is achieved by conforming to God's will, one knows intuitively that which is wrong and that which is right before the Lord. Holiness speaks when there is silence, encouraging that which is good or reproving that which is wrong.”
― James E. Faust

“My faith has been tempered in Hell. My faith has emerged from the flames of the crematoria, from the concrete of the gas chamber. I have seen that it is not man who is impotent in the struggle against evil, but the power of evil that is impotent in the struggle against man. The powerlessness of kindness, of senseless kindness, is the secret of its immortality. It can never be conquered. The more stupid, the more senseless, the more helpless it may seem, the vaster it is. Evil is impotent before it. The prophets, religious teachers, reformers, social and political leaders are impotent before it. This dumb, blind love is man's meaning.
Human history is not the battle of good struggling to overcome evil. It is a battle fought by a great evil struggling to crush a small kernel of human kindness. But if what is human in human beings has not been destroyed even now, then evil will never conquer.”
― Vasily Grossman, Life and Fate

“All was in God's plan, and he had to accept even as he didn't understand.”

“You’ll only fall if you doubt your balance.”
― Willa Okati, By Your Side

“My faith in the expertise of physicists like Richard Feynman, for instance, permits me to endorse—and, if it comes to it, bet heavily on the truth of—a proposition that I don't understand. So far, my faith is not unlike religious faith, but I am not in the slightest bit motivated to go to my death rather than recant the formulas of physics. Watch: E doesn't equal mc2, it doesn't, it doesn't! I was lying, so there!”
― Daniel C. Dennett, Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon

“All right, God, say that You are really there. You have put me in this fix. You want to test me. Suppose I test You? Suppose I say that You are not there? You've given me a supreme test with my parents and with these boils. I think that I have passed Your test. I am tougher than You. If You will come down here right now, I will spit into Your face, if You have a face. And do You shit? The priest never answered that question. He told us not to doubt. Doubt what? I think that You have been picking on me too much so I am asking You to come down here so I can put You to the test! I waited. Nothing. I waited for God. I waited and waited. I believe I slept.”
― Charles Bukowski, Ham on Rye

“Faith can move mountains. So why are you stumbling on a little rock?”
― Jonathan Nettles

“We can say that true gratitude does not give rise to the debtor's ethic because it gives rise to faith in future grace. With true gratitude there is such a delight in the worth of God's past grace, that we are driven on to experience more and more of it in the future...it is done by transforming gratitude into faith as it turns from contemplating the pleasures of past grace and starts contemplating the promises of the future. ”
― John Piper

“We pray for the big things and forget to give thanks for the ordinary, small (and yet really not small) gifts.”

“Whatever your passion is, keep doing it. Don't waste time chasing after success or comparing yourself to others. Every flower blooms at a different pace. Excel at doing what your passion is and only focus on perfecting it. Eventually people will see what you are great at doing, and if you are truly great, success will come chasing after you.”
― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem

“Indeed, a quick glance around this broken world makes it painfully obvious that we don't need more arguments on behalf of God; we need more people who live as if they are in covenant with Unconditional Love, which is our best definition of God. (p. 21)”

“I am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of God whether they are led by him. I am fearful they settle down in a state of blind self security. Let every man and woman know, by the whispering of the Spirit of God to themselves, whether their leaders are walking in the path the Lord dictates, or not.”
― Brigham Young

“I believe in God the way I believe in quarks. People whose business it is to know about quantum physics or religion tell me they have good reason to believe that quarks and God exist. And they tell me that if I wanted to devote my life to learning what they've learned, I'd find quarks and God just like they did.”

“If you hold a candle close to you, its flame rises. And if you hold it away from you, its flame shrinks. The same way you hold a candle close to you, keep all your plans, aspirations, projects, and dreams close to you too. Do not share your plans or goals until you complete them, because as you hold your candle away from you, your goals will shrink in the eyes of others. Envy, jealousy, and resentment will put out your flame before it grows.”
― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem

“My discourse leads to the truth; the mind is great and guided by this teaching is able to arrive at some understanding. When the mind has understood all things and found them to be in harmony with what has been expounded by the teachings, it is faithful and comes to rest in that beautiful faith.”

“The problem that we are facing in the church today is that we have so many Christians who have made a decision to believe in Jesus but not a commitment to follow Him. We have people who are planning to, meaning to, trying to, wanting to, going to, we just don't have people who are doing it.”
― Tyler Edwards, Zombie Church: Breathing Life Back Into the Body of Christ

“Why do some persons 'find' God in a way that others do not? Why does God manifest His Presence to some and let multitudes of others struggle along in the half-light of imperfect Christian experience? Of course the will of God is the same for all. He has no favorites within His household. All He has ever done for any of His children He will do for all of His children. The difference lies not with God but with us.”
― A.W. Tozer, The Pursuit of God: The Human Thirst for the Divine

“Alone: for the first time I understood the terrible significance of that word. Alone without a witness, without anyone to speak to, without refuge. The breath in my body, the blood in my veins, all this hurly-burly in my head existed for nobody.”

“Whatever negative things people think and say about you is enough to bring you down provided you belief that it carries a weight that can push you hard. Don't agree to accept what critics say; be prepared to silence them by doing what they think you can't do!”

“It isn't for the moment you are struck that you need courage, but for that long uphill climb back to sanity and faith and security.”

“If God is omnipotent and omniscient, why didn't he start the universe out in the first place so it would come out the way he wants? Why's he constantly repairing and complaining? No, there's one thing the Bible makes clear: The biblical God is a sloppy manufacturer. He's not good at design, he's not good at execution. He'd be out of business, if there was any competition.”
― Carl Sagan, Contact

“It is hard to see how a great man can be an atheist. Without the sustaining influence of faith in a divine power we could have little faith in ourselves. We need to feel that behind us is intelligence and love. Doubters do not achieve; skeptics do not contribute; cynics do not create. Faith is the great motive power, and no man realizes his full possibilities unless he has the deep conviction that life is eternally important, and that his work, well done, is a part of an unending plan.”
― Calvin Coolidge

“Some people say they will not believe in anything they can't see. What a catastrophe to not have any faith at all! You live only less than a half of life, if you will only believe in the things that you can see. Life is lived by those who have much faith and believe in many unseen things. If you believe in nothing that you cannot see, think about how much there is that you choose to turn your face away from! You can't see your soul and you cannot prove that it exists, therefore if you call yourself one who believes in nothing unseen, then you will forever deny your soul its existence, for the existence of the soul dwells in love, trust, anger, passion, faith, belief, strength; the soul is forever nourished by things that are unseen! And so we have too many empty bodies walking around! Bodies with souls inside that are half-dead and dying.”
― C. JoyBell C.

“People will always notice something about you. It might be the way you walk or the way you talk, or just simply your personality. Live each day in the way you want to be remembered.

“Guidance, like all God's acts of blessing under the covenant of grace, is a sovereign act. Not merely does God will to guide us in the sense of showing us his way, that we may tread it; he wills also to guide us in the more fundamental sense of ensuring that, whatever happens, whatever mistakes we may make, we shall come safely home. Slippings and strayings there will be, no doubt, but the everlasting arms are beneath us; we shall be caught, rescued, restored. This is God's promise; this is how good he is.”

“Beware the religion that turns you against another one. It's unlikely that it's really religion at all.”

“I have one life and one chance to make it count for something . . . I'm free to choose what that something is, and the something I've chosen is my faith. Now, my faith goes beyond theology and religion and requires considerable work and effort. My faith demands -- this is not optional -- my faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can with whatever I have to try to make a difference.”

“There are 6 reasons that a person does anything: Love, faith, greed, boredom, fear... revenge.”

“The question the doubter does not ask is whether faith was really useless or simply not used. What would you think of a boy who gave up learning to ride a bicycle, complaining that he hurt himself because his bicycle stopped moving so he had no choice but to fall off? If he wanted to sit comfortably while remaining stationary, he should not have chosen a bicycle but a chair. Similarly faith must be put to use, or it will become useless.”

“We are not asked to SEE," said Amy. "Why need we when we KNOW?" We know--not the answer to the inevitable Why, but the incontestable fact that it is for the best. "It is an irreparable loss, but is it faith at all if it is 'hard to trust' when things are entirely bewildering?”

“You are entitled to know that two entities occupy your body. One of these entities is motivated by and responds to the impulse of fear. The other is motivated by and responds to the impulse of faith. Will you be guided by faith or will you allow fear to overtake you?”

“I often ask myself, 'Who would Jesus vote for?' Then I start to think that he wouldn't vote at all; however, it would not be out of apathy or disinterest, but out of perfection and light. As a miracle worker, I think he would, by the power of God's teachings, the perseverance and the truth, influence in a modern sense whoever is put into office how to best serve his fellow men. One, like his skeptics, may find that impractical. But there is a message in that no man in power can slow the momentum of the will of God, and the miracles of his teachings will be forever victorious.”

“Fatigue can make it hard to have faith. Too much busyness can make it hard to have faith. Too much of too little solitude can impact faith. For that matter, so can a bout of hunger or overwork, anything carried to an extreme. Faith thrives on routine. Look at any monastery and you will see that. Faith keeps on keeping on.”
― Julia Cameron, Finding Water: The Art of Perseverance

“A disciple: I am worried about human suffering all over the world. What is the solution?Spiritual leader: The solution to our miseries lie within central atom of our being, ‘I’. Once this central atom transcends to ‘WE’, human sufferings can be resolved.”

“The courage is light of one’s life,
is the beauty of today.

The hope of one’s soul,
is the promise of a tomorrow.

The times of our past,
is a wisdom for anytime.

The labour of our sacrifice and love,
is a masterpiece of our moments.

The voyage of one’s mind,
is a journey towards discovery.

The joy in one’s heart,
is a gift for everyone.

The faith of a soul,
is a key to hope and to love.

The true unconditional love of a heart
is a priceless treasure one can ever give.

For our mind, heart and soul
In any journey of rise or fall,
Let faith, hope and love breathe!
As you share it for whom your heart beats.”
― Angelica Hopes, Rhythm of a Heart, Music of a Soul

“There are some who are still weak in faith, who ought to be instructed, and who would gladly believe as we do. But their ignorance prevents them...we must bear patiently with these people and not use our liberty; since it brings to peril or harm to body or soul...but if we use our liberty unnecessarily, and deliberately cause offense to our neighbor, we drive away the very one who in time would come to our faith. Thus St. Paul circumcised Timothy (Acts 16:3) because simple minded Jews had taken offense; he thought: what harm can it do, since they are offended because of ignorance? But when, in Antioch, they insisted that he out and must circumcise Titus (Gal. 2:3) Paul withstood them all and to spite them refused to have Titus circumcised... He did the same when St. Peter...it happened in this way: when Peter was with the Gentiles he ate pork and sausages with them, but when the Jews came in, he abstained from this food and did not eat as he did before. Then the Gentiles who had become Christians though: Alas! we, too, must be like the Jews, eat no pork, and live according to the law of Moses. But when Paul learned that they were acting to the injury of evangelical freedom, he reproved Peter publicly and read him an apostolic lecture, saying: "If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?" (Gal. 2:14). Thus we, too, should order our lives and use our liberty at the proper time, so that Christian liberty may suffer no injury, and no offense be given to our weak brothers and sisters who are still without the knowledge of this liberty.”
― Martin Luther

“I mean that the reason God seems to act in ways that make no sense to us is that our perceptions are wrong. Our expectations are subtly twisted. We long for things that harm us and run from the things that grow and heal us. We think good is bad and bad is good. God acts rightly, but to us, it seems confusing. Or sometimes plain wrong.”

“Maybe we are a little crazy. After all, we believe in things we don't see. The Scriptures say that faith is "being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see" (Heb. 11:1). We believe poverty can end even though it is all around us. We believe in peace even though we hear only rumours of wars. And since we are people of expectation, we are so convinced that another world is coming that we start living as if it were already here.”

“Orthodoxy is idolatry if it means holding the 'correct opinions about God' - 'fundamentalism' is the most extreme and salient example of such idolatry - but not if it means holding faith in the right way, that is, not holding it at all but being held by God, in love and service. Theology is idolatry if it means what we say about God instead of letting ourselves be addressed by what God has to say to us. Faith is idolatrous if it is rigidly self-certain but not if it is softened in the waters of 'doubt.”
― John D. Caputo, What Would Jesus Deconstruct?: The Good News of Postmodernism for the Church

“God doesn't expect us to be a walking encyclopedia of biblical knowledge. He wants us to know Him, to be in a relationship with Him.

“Christianity, like genius, is one of the hardest concepts to forgive. We hear what we want to hear and accept what we want to accept, for the most part, simply because there is nothing more offensive than feeling like you have to re-evaluate your own train of thought and purpose in life. You have to die to an extent in your hunger for faith, for wisdom, and quite frankly, most people aren't ready to die.”

He cultivates the ground, he plants the seed, he waters the plants, and then the natural forces of the earth take over and up comes the grain...This is the way it is with the Spiritual Disciplines - they are a way of sowing to the Spirit... By themselves the Spiritual Disciplines can do nothing; they can only get us to the place where something can be done.”

You will live in a time where instead of sometimes being fulfilled, many of them will actually be fulfilled. The Lord will unfold your future bit by bit.”

“(about William Blake)

[Blake] said most of us mix up God and Satan. He said that what most people think is God is merely prudence, and the restrainer and inhibitor of energy, which results in fear and passivity and "imaginative death."

And what we so often call "reason" and think is so fine, is not intelligence or understanding at all, but just this: it is arguing from our *memory* and the sensations of our body and from the warnings of other people, that if we do such and such a thing we will be uncomfortable. "It won't pay." "People will think it is silly." "No one else does it." "It is immoral."

But the only way you can grow in understanding and discover whether a thing is good or bad, Blake says, is to do it. "Sooner strangle an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires."

For this "Reason" as Blake calls it (which is really just caution) continually nips and punctures and shrivels the imagination and the ardor and the freedom and the passionate enthusiasm welling up in us. It is Satan, Blake said. It is the only enemy of God. "For nothing is pleasing to God except the invention of beautiful and exalted things." And when a prominent citizen of his time, a logical, opining, erudite, measured, rationalistic, Know-it-all, warned people against "mere enthusiasm," Blake wrote furiously (he was a tender-hearted, violent and fierce red-haired man): "Mere enthusiasm is the All in All!”

― Dr. C. Moorer, From Failure to Promise: An Uncommon Path to Professoriate

“When we find that God's ways always coincide with our own ways, it's time to question who we're really worshipping, God or ourselves. The latter moves the nature of godliness from the King to our servant to a slave, a deduction into the realm of selfhood and then the lower, slavehood. It's a spiritual mathematics in that men who need God in his godhood are humble yet strong and spiritually ambitious while men who need a slave in their selfhood are ultimately paralyzed and will remain paralyzed.”

“It [Communism] is not new. It is, in fact, man's second oldest faith. Its promise was whispered in the first days of the Creation under the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil: "Ye shall be as gods." It is the great alternative faith of mankind. Like all great faiths, its force derives from a simple vision. Other ages have had great visions. They have always been different versions of the same vision: the vision of God and man's relationship to God. The Communist vision is the vision of Man without God.
It is the vision of man's mind displacing God as the creative intelligence of the world. It is the vision of man's liberated mind, by the sole force of its rational intelligence, redirecting man's destiny and reorganizing man's life and the world. It is the vision of man, once more the central figure of the Creation, not because God made man in his image, but because man's mind makes him the most intelligent of the animals. Copernicus and his successors displaced man as the central fact of the universe by proving that the earth was not the central star of the universe. Communism restores man to his sovereignty by the simple method of denying God.”
― Whittaker Chambers, Witness

― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem

“What I admire about the modern atheist is not at all his logic, but rather his gift of imagination. There will always be the cartoon versions of Christianity further perpetuated by the extremist atheists who do not possess the humility to ask real scholars and theologians its difficult questions. There is little doubt that the atheist has the bigger imagination: the first reason is due to his persistent caricatures of what constitutes a Christian; the second because of his belief that most of his questions are actually rhetorical. From this I can infer that, instead of laughing at one another (the Christian at modern atheist immaturity and the modern atheist at Christian stupidity), we would have a better chance at productivity laughing with one another as we all dumb down what we don't understand.”

“The vermin explain their sin with sanctimonious language like, "We've prayed about it and sought counsel, and we feel it's the right thing to do." Don't let it down on them that to the Enemy what they feel is inconsequential. His moral laws don't give a rip about how any of them feel. The sludgebags have no more power to vote them in and out of existence than they have power to revoke the law of gravity.”
― Randy Alcorn, Lord Foulgrin's Letters

“Faithful people suffer and evil people prosper all the time [...]. Besides, if our actions are driven only by reward or punishment--eternal or otherwise--then they are motivated by greed and selfishness, not faith or love. That is where so many people go wrong, even those who say they believe [...]. They obey because the think it will make their *lives* better, rather than *themselves*. And that is very much the wrong reason.”
― James Islington, The Light of All That Falls

“A man of God would never burn or harm a temple of any kind - regardless of religion.

“For centuries the church has stood by while science picked away at religion bit by bit. Debunking miracles. Training the mind to overcome the heart. Condemning religion as the opiate of the masses. They denounce God as a hallucination - a delusional crutch for those too weak to accept that life is meaningless. I could not stand by while science presumed to harness the power of God himself! Proof, you say? Yes, proof of science's ignorance! What is wrong with the admission that something exists beyond our understanding? The day science substantiates God in a lab is the day people stop needing faith!”

But my Christianity is a muddy mess of thoughts and opinions and making God into what works for me-like going shopping at the mall and picking out whatever I want, putting together faith like I would an outfit. Somehow I don't think the Creator, the I AM, the savior of the world is something we can mix and match to out liking.”
― Cindy Martinusen-Coloma, Caleb + Kate

“I guess that's where faith comes in, the faith of a child to believe in Santa, the faith of an adult to believe in God, maybe faith is what makes something real? Maybe Rose had believed enough to create her own afterlife, maybe that's the reward of faith...”

“The response to war is to live like brothers and sisters. The response to injustice is to share. The response to despair is a limitless trust and hope. The response to prejudice and hatred is forgiveness. To work for community is to work for humanity. To work for peace is to work for a true political solution; it is to work for the Kingdom of God. It is to work to enable every one to live and taste the secret joys of the human person united to the eternal.”
― Jean Vanier, Community And Growth

“[I]t is difficult to imagine a set of beliefs more suggestive of mental illness than those that lie at the heart of many of our religious traditions.”
― Sam Harris, The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason

“Men and women are needed whose prayers will give to the world the utmost power of God; who will make His promises to blossom with rich and full results. God is waiting to hear us and challenges us to bring Him to do this thing by our praying. He is asking us, to-day, as He did His ancient Israel, to prove Him now herewith." Behind God's Word is God Himself, and we read: "Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, his Maker: Ask of me of things to come and concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me." As though God places Himself in the hands and at the disposal of His people who pray - as indeed He does. The dominant element of all praying is faith, that is conspicuous, cardinal and emphatic. Without such faith it is impossible to please God, and equally impossible to pray.”
― E.M. Bounds, The Weapon of Prayer

“Reading a book about something can be an obstacle to doing it because it gives you the impression that you are doing what you are only thinking about doing. It is tempting to remain in the comfortable theater of our imagination instead of the real world, to fall in love with the idea of becoming a saint and loving God and neighbor instead of doing the actual work, because the idea makes no demands on you. It is like a book on a shelf. But, as Dostoyevsky says, 'love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in dreams' (The Brothers Karamazov).”
― Peter Kreeft, Prayer For Beginners

“There are certain mortal moments and minutes that matter. Certain hingepoints in the history of each human. Some seconds are so decisive they shrink the soul, while others are spent, so as to stretch the soul.”
― Neal A. Maxwell

“The Latin words humus, soil/earth, and homo, human being, have a common derivation, from which we also get our word 'humble.' This is the Genesis origin of who we are: dust - dust that the Lord God used to make us a human being. If we cultivate a lively sense of our origin and nurture a sense of continuity with it, who knows, we may also acquire humility.”
― Eugene Peterson, Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places

“If the Creator stood before a million men with the light of a million lamps, only a few would truly see him because truth is already alive in their hearts. Truth can only be seen by those with truth in them. He who does not have Truth in his heart, will always be blind to it.”
― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem

“What has happened to create this doubt is that a problem (such as a deep conflict or a bad experience) has been allowed to usurp God's place and become the controlling principle of life. Instead of viewing the problem from the vantage point of faith, the doubter views faith from the vantage point of the problem. Instead of faith sizing up the problem, the situation ends with the problem scaling down faith. The world of faith is upside down, and in the topsy-turvy reality of doubt, a problem has become god and God has become a problem.”
― OS Guiness

“Although the far territory of the extreme can exert an intoxicating pull on susceptible individuals of all bents, extremism seems to be especially prevalent among those inclined by temperament or upbringing toward religious pursuits. Faith is the very antithesis of reason, injudiciousness a crucial component of spiritual devotion. And when religious fanaticism supplants ratiocination, all bets are suddenly off.”
― Jon Krakauer, Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith

“Perhaps true faith is a form of insanity.”
― Kristine Kathryn Rusch, The Sacrifice

“He that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail.”
― William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet

“Realizing the seriously ruthless, venomous habits and agendas of evil always instills a more fierce passion and longing for a closer God. Men, out of pride, may claim their own authorities over what constitutes good and evil; they may self-proclaim a keen knowledge of subjective morality through religion or science. But that is only if they are acknowledging the work of evil as a cartoon-like, petty little rain cloud in the sky that merely wants to dampen one's spirits. On the contrary, a man could be without a doubt lit with the strength, the peace, and the knowledge of the gods, his gods, but when or if the devils grow weary in unsuccessful attempts to torment him, they begin tormenting his loved ones, or, if not his loved ones, anyone who may attempt to grasp his philosophies. No matter how godly he may become, God is, in the end, his only hope and his only grace for the pressures built around him - it is left up to a higher authority and a more solid peace and a wider love to eclipse not just one's own evils but all evils for goodness to ultimately matter. If all men were gods, each being would dwell in a separate prison cell, hopeless, before finally imploding into nothingness.”
― Criss Jami, Killosophy

“The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said, When Allah loves a people, He tries them.”

“There is nothing anti-intellectual in the leap of faith, for faith is not believing without proof but trusting without reservation.”

“Спомням си как през летните следобеди, които прекарвах там, баба ми, привършила домашната работа, сядаше до прозореца на светло и вадеше от своя скришен сандък една огромна Библия с твърди корици, обвита с тогавашния официозен вестник "Работническо дело" по конспиративни причини. Вече знаех, че комунизмът и Библията никак не се обичаха.”

“We try too much and trust too little. Count the times God's Book tells us to "try." Now count the times it tells us to "trust.”
― Peter Kreeft, Prayer For Beginners

“When we look for success, it should be for the sole purpose of boasting sincerely in Christ. There's no other reason for it. Success is only worth it when the more intense it gets for you, the more you find yourself bragging for his glory rather than your own.”
― Criss Jami, Killosophy

“So as I shivered, naked and damp, in front of the bathroom mirror, I raised my eyes skyward. "I hope we're still okay."

I got no answer, but then, I didn't really expect one. Answer or not, it didn't matter. That's the thing about faith, I guess.”
― Chloe Neill

“You can get lost on your way home. You can get lost looking for love. You can get lost between jobs. You can get lost looking for God. However it happens, take heart. Others before you have found a way in the wilderness, where there are as many angels as there are wild beasts, and plenty of other lost people too. All it takes is one of them to find you. All it takes is you to find one of them. However it happens, you could do worse than to kneel down and ask a blessing, remembering how many knees have kissed this altar before you.”
― Barbara Brown Taylor

“And then all that has divided us will merge
And then compassion will be wedded to power
And then softness will come to a world that is harsh and unkind
And then both men and women will be gentle
And then both women and men will be strong
And then no person will be subject to another's will
And then all will be rich and free and varied
And then the greed of some will give way to the needs of many
And then all will share equally in the Earth's abundance
And then all will care for the sick and the weak and the old
And then all will nourish the young
And then all will cherish life's creatures
And then all will live in harmony with each other and the Earth
And then everywhere will be called Eden once again.”
― Judy Chicago

“When you are happy, so happy you have no sense of needing Him, so happy that you are tempted to feel His claims upon you as an interruption, if you remember yourself and turn to Him with gratitude and praise, you will be — or so it feels— welcomed with open arms. But go to Him when your need is desperate, when all other help is vain, and what do you find? A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside. After that, silence.”
― C.S. Lewis, A Grief Observed

“The older I grow and the more I abandon myself to God's will, the less
I value intelligence that wants to know and will that wants to do; and
as the only element of salvation I recognize faith, which can wait patiently,
without asking too many questions.”
― Umberto Eco, The Name of the Rose

“Belief creates the actual fact.”
― William James

“But all the while, there was one thing we most needed even from the start, and certainly will need from here on out into the New Jerusalem: the ability to take our freedom seriously and act on it, to live not in fear of mistakes but in the knowledge that no mistake can hold a candle to the love that draws us home. My repentance, accordingly, is not so much for my failings but for the two-bit attitude toward them by which I made them more sovereign than grace. Grace - the imperative to hear the music, not just listen for errors - makes all infirmities occasions of glory.”
― Robert Farrar Capon, Between Noon & Three: Romance, Law & the Outrage of Grace

“If you have abandoned one faith, do not abandon all faith. There is always an alternative to the faith we lose. Or is it the same faith under another name?”

“Her heart felt as if it were breaking in her breast, bleeding and bleeding, young and fierce. From grief over the warm and ardent love which she had lost and still secretly mourned; from anguished joy over the pale, luminous love which drew her to the farthest boundaries of life on this earth. Through the great darkness that would come, she saw the gleam of another, gentler sun, and she sensed the fragrance of the herbs in the garden at world's end.”
― Sigrid Undset, The Wife

“Faith is a luxury for those who are able to ignore what the rest of us must see every day. Pessimism, distrust, and irony are the holy trinity of my religion, irony in particular.”

“It may be a procession of faithful failures that enriches the soil of godly success. Faithful actions are not religious acts. They are not even necessary actions undertaken by people of faith. Faithful actions, whether they are marked by success or they end in failure, are actions that are compelled by goodness.”

“I believe we are more ready to embrace our lives in the here and now when we are able to recognize the continuity between the immanence of God in our world and eternity. Rather than simply waiting to be liberated to another time or place, we are being invited to collaborate in the healing and redemption of our world.”
― Mark Scandrette, Soul Graffiti: Making a Life in the Way of Jesus

“I guess this thing we call faith is a climb. I always wanted to think of it as a big slide straight into the arms of God who waits at the bottom to catch us. But instead, He's a God who's on top of things - & like any mountain you climb, the closer we get to Him, the steeper the terrain.”
― Lisa Samson

“So much had been surrendered! And to such little purpose!

“Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.

But no, that is not quite accurate. There is one place where her absence comes locally home to me, and it is a place I can't avoid. I mean my own body. It had such a different importance while it was the body of H.'s lover. Now it's like an empty house.”
― C.S. Lewis, A Grief Observed

“It is the test of a good religion whether you can joke about it.”
― G.K. Chesterton

“Some communities don't permit open, honest inquiry about the things that matter most. Lots of people have voiced a concern, expressed a doubt, or raised a question, only to be told by their family, church, friends, or tribe: "We don't discuss those things here."

I believe the discussion itself is divine. Abraham does his best to bargain with God, most of the book of Job consists of arguments by Job and his friends about the deepest questions of human suffering, God is practically on trial in the book of Lamentations, and Jesus responds to almost every question he's asked with...a question.”

“Religion doesn't just cloud our minds. It asks us to deliberately deceive ourselves-- to replace reason with its opposite, faith. And when men operate on faith, they can no longer be reasoned with, which makes them more dangerous than any sane man, good or evil.”

“Ultimately we have nothing to fear. Jesus loves us, and he invites us to be confident in that love. As we seek to obey Him, we are not called to assess the risk involved and determine whether or not obedience will be beneficial or safe for us. We are simply called to trust and obey.”
― Dan Baumann, A Beautiful Way: An Invitation to a Jesus-Centered Life

“The true value of a man is not determined by his possession, supposed or real, of Truth, but rather by his sincere exertion to get to the Truth. It is not possession of the Truth, but rather the pursuit of Truth by which he extends his powers and in which his ever-growing perfectibility is to be found. Possession makes one passive, indolent, and proud.”
― Gotthold Ephraim Lessing

“Love and faith are not common companions. More commonly power and fear consort with faith....Power is not to be crossed; one must respect and obey. Power means strength, whereas love is a human frailty the people mistrust. It is a sad fact of life that power and fear are the fountainheads of faith.”
― Saul Alinsky, Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals

“The universe contains many planets which make it what it is – a unified system. In addition, our bodies contain many organs, and each part is congruent to a planet in our solar system. The universe we see out our eyes is a mirror of what is within us. This is what God meant by making man in his image. We are all made as a reflection of God and that reflection of him is within us. Furthermore, not only are all religions connected to the same Truth, or Cosmic Heart, but this concept is also mirrored in the pantheons of ancient religions, where each of the many gods simply represented one set of characteristics of the ONE. And in all cases, these many gods symbolized the planets, therefore mimicking the different parts of the universe and the ONE God’s many mirrors (He Who is All). The structure behind all polytheistic religions of the past and present is one and the same. They are all built on the same foundation as Nature.”
― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem

“God really performs the miracle of multiplying our time, but only if we give it to him first.”
― Peter Kreeft, Prayer For Beginners

“We do matter. To believe that our lives are meaningful is the essence of faith. We are not as large, or as bright, or as eternal as the stars, but we carry humankind's message of love across the galaxy. We are the first. We are the world makers. Our nourishment is hope. Like the tender reed shaking in the wind, we will reach up to a new sun.”

“O Heavenly Children, do not forget that God is here, there and everywhere. The birds are his eyes and the air is his ears. And as you sleep, your heart and soul rest naked before him. He can drink from the rivers of your thoughts, and even feel the wetness of your tears.”

“Nothing will get you into trouble so deep or as sad as faith.”
― Rick Bass, The Watch

“It is debatable whether blind faith is truly faith at all. Faith is the perceptive gray area where scientific facts meet an individual's experiential truths - the extreme of the former is left feeling in the dark whereas the latter is caught blinded by the light. By proper scientific method, it is intellectually dishonest for me to declare the existence of God with utmost certainty, but to my individual spirit, I would be intellectually dishonest to deny the existence of God even for a second. This leaves the best of both worlds, as the believer is called to be able to give reasons for his faith, a deviation from mere fantasy.”
― Criss Jami, Killosophy

“I said, "Where's all that delivering God's supposed to do?"
He snorted. "You're right, the only deliverance is the one we get for ourselves. The Lord doesn't have any hands and feet but ours."
"That doesn't say much for the Lord."
"It doesn't say much for us, either.”
― Sue Monk Kidd, The Invention of Wings

“To choose not to be part of a team or religion does not make me non-religious; for my religion is Truth and I am very much in love with God. I do not need to align myself with a specific messenger if I already understand God’s message. And the way I think is not considered ‘New Age’, since common sense is not new. So long as you act and speak with love and truth in you, and are good to your fellow man — in that you treat everybody as you would want yourself to be treated, your heart will stand by God regardless of the label you have assigned to your mind.”
― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem

“The conflicting missions of the two armies seemed to have no fog, no gray, only black-and-white clarity. I had lived my life in terms of compromise, rule-bending, trade-offs, concessions, bargaining, striking deals, finding middle ground. In these two great armies, there was no such thing. Good was good, and evil was evil, and they shared no common ground.”
― Randy Alcorn, Edge of Eternity

“They knew how to live with nature and get along with nature. They didn't try too hard to be all men and no animal. That's the mistake we made when Darwin showed up. We embraced him and Huxley and Freud, all smiles. And then we discovered that Darwin and our religions didn't mix. Or at least we didn't think they did. We were fools. We tried to budge Darwin and Huxley and Freud. They wouldn't move very well. So, like idiots, we tried knocking down religion. We succeeded pretty well. We lost our faith and went around wondering what life was for. If art was no more than a frustrated outflinging of desire, if religion was no more than self-delusion, what good was life? Faith had always given us answer to all things. But it all went down the drain with Freud and Darwin. We were and still are lost people.”
― Ray Bradbury, The Martian Chronicles

“Faith moves mountains, but only knowledge moves them to the right place...”
― Joseph Goebbels

“Grace is the celebration of life, relentlessly hounding all the non-celebrants in the world. It is a floating, cosmic bash shouting its way through the streets of the universe, flinging the sweetness of its cassations to every window, pounding at every door in a hilarity beyond all liking and happening, until the prodigals come out at last and dance, and the elder brothers finally take their fingers out of their ears.”
― Robert Farrar Capon, Between Noon & Three: Romance, Law & the Outrage of Grace

“People think of faith as being something that you don't really believe, a device in helping you believe simply it. Of course that is quite wrong. As Pascal says, faith is a gift of God. It is different from the proof of it. It is the kind of faith God himself places in the heart, of which the proof is often the instrument...
He says of it, too, that it is the heart which is aware of God, and not reason. That is what faith is: God perceived by the heart, not be reason.”
― Malcolm Muggeridge, The End of Christendom

“Do you know, the only people I can have a conversation with are the Jews? At least when they quote scripture at you they are not merely repeating something some priest has babbled in their ear. They have the great merit of disagreeing with nearly everything I say. In fact, they disagree with almost everything they say themselves. And most importantly, they don't think that shouting strengthens their argument.”

“At times, he didn't understand the meaning of the Koran's words. But he said he liked the enhancing sounds the Arabic words made as they rolled off his tongue.

God's words will never betray you, my girl.”
― Khaled Hosseini, A Thousand Splendid Suns

“Religious people tend to encounter, among those who are not, a cemented certainty that belief in God is a crutch for the weak and the fearful...Now the belief in God may turn out at the last trump to be a mistake. Meantime, let us be quite clear, it is not merely the comfort of the simple--though it is that too, much to its glory--it is a formidable intellectual position with which most of the first-class minds of the human race, century in and century out, have concurred, each in his own way....speaking of crutches--Freud can be a crutch, Marx can be a crutch, rationalism can be a crutch, and atheism can be two canes and a pair of iron braces. We none of us have all the answers, nor are we likely to have. But in the country of the halt, the man who is surest he has no limp may be the worst-crippled.”

“We worship…the powers that speak to our souls, if it seems they do. We do so knowing there is more to the world, and the half-world, and perhaps worlds beyond, than we can grasp. We always knew that. We can’t even stop children from dying, how would we presume to understand the truth of things? Behind things? Does the presence of one power deny another? [p. 176]”
― Guy Gavriel Kay, Sailing to Sarantium

“Floating there I held onto faith. Because you can't know who might cross your path or who will take your breath away. You can't know what friends might actually become sisters because they stayed by your side. You can't know when there'll be an unexpected detour that'll take you to the place where you were always meant to be.”
― Holly C. Corbett, The Lost Girls: Three Friends. Four Continents. One Unconventional Detour Around the World.

“The greatest joy is joy in God. This is plain from Psalm 16:11: "You [God] will make known to me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever." Fullness of joy and eternal joy cannot be improved. Nothing is fuller than full, and nothing is longer than eternal. And this joy is owing to the presence of God, not the accomplishments of man. Therefore, if God wants to love us infinitely and delight us fully and eternally, he must preserve for us the one thing that will satisfy us totally and eternally; namely, the presence and worth of his own glory. He alone is the source of full and lasting pleasure. Therefore, his commitment to uphold and display his glory is not vain, but virtuous. God is the one being for whom self-exaltation is an infinitely loving act. If he revealed himself to the proud and self-sufficient and not to the humble and dependent, he would belittle the very glory whose worth is the foundation of our joy. Therefore, God's pleasure in hiding this from "the wise and intelligent" and revealing it to "infants" is the pleasure of God in both his glory and our joy.”
― John Piper, The Pleasures of God: Meditations on God's Delight in Being God

“How could anyone love Him? What did you just tell me yourself about the world? Don't you see, everybody hates God now. It's not that God is dead in the twentieth century. It's that everybody hates Him! At least I think so.”
― Anne Rice, Memnoch the Devil

“Each of them had done their best. Matt was still his friend. For Meredith, maybe the day would come when she could look at him and not think “inhuman” — or at least not think it immediately and constantly. Maybe Bonnie, the moth, would be able to stay away from the unholy flame. Now, there was something to worry about. He could all too easily see Bonnie taking a walk on the very wild side with Damon. His brother had a soft spot for her already, she knew. But if either of them had a problem, he already knew what he had to do to find a plan for a solution.

Just look up.”

“Before you have faith you must believe, and before you believe there must be evidence of some sort to persuade the mind. Faith is remembering that evidence and holding to it against all that seems to challenge or contradict it.”

“At the tattoo parlor, my friend worked with needle and ink applying a design to the skin on his client's back, as the three of us sat discussing our spiritual desires and ambivalence about religion. In the midst of our conversation, the man under the needle turned and said, 'Jesus is cool, it's just that they have f***ed with Jesus. I mean, Christianity was at its best when it was secret and hidden and you could die for it.' This profound, if crass, statement recognizes that the power of the gospel lay in its ability to be a counter-cultural and revolutionary force - not only a story to believe, but a distinctive way of life. The man's comment prompted me to consider the questions: Am I in some measure complicit in the domestication of Jesus?”
― Mark Scandrette, Soul Graffiti: Making a Life in the Way of Jesus

“I had another reason for seeking Him, for trying to espy His face, a professional one. God and literature are conflated in my mind. Why this is, I’m not sure. Perhaps because great books seem heavensent. Perhaps because I know that each nove is a puny but very valiant attempt at godlike behavior. Perhaps because there is no difference between the finest poetry and most transcendent mysticism. Perhaps because writers like Thomas Merton, who are able to enter the realm of the spirit and come away with fine, lucid prose. Perhaps because of more secular writers, like John Steinbeck, whose every passage, it seems to me, peals with religiousity and faith. It once occured to me that literature — all art really — is either talking to people about God, or talking to God about people.”

“PRAISE FOR 'THE JOURNEY HOME'
Many saints are known and praised by all. We pray to them in litanies and celebrate their feast days. But the vast majority of holy men and women live heroic lives quietly before God.

Loyal to family, lovers of God, servants in the Church, these unsung saints live everyday life as an example for us. David Hanneman is one such man. His story is exemplary and should be told to the world. He not only lived a noble life, but also suffered with heroism and grace as he passed into glory.

This is a story to encourage and bless us all. We are thankful to Joseph Hanneman for sharing his father and making his story known to us who need such examples to encourage us as we face the difficulties and challenges of life.”

“Only add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith;
Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love,
By name to come called charity, the soul
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath
To leave this Paradise; but shalt possess
A paradise within thee, happier far.”
― John Milton

“Thus we arrive at the singular conclusion that of all the information passed by our cultural assets it is precisely the elements which might be of the greatest importance to us and which have the task of solving the riddles of the universe and of reconciling us to the sufferings of life -- it is precisely those elements that are the least well authenticated of any.”
― Sigmund Freud, The Future of an Illusion

“Faith and science, I have learned, are two sides of the same coin, separated by an expanse so small, but wide enough that one side can't see the other. They don't even know they're connected. Father and Lily were two sides of the same coin, I've decided, and maybe I am the space in between.”

“I've got my own moral compass to steer by
A guiding star beats a spirit in the sky
And all the preaching voices -
Empty vessels ring so loud
As they move among the crowd
Fools and thieves are well disguised
In the temple and market place

Like a stone in the river
Against the floods of spring
I will quietly resist

Like the willows in the wind
Or the cliffs along the ocean
I will quietly resist

I don't have faith in faith
I don't believe in belief
You can call me faithless
I still cling to hope
And I believe in love
And that's faith enough for me

I've got my own spirit level for balance
To tell if my choice is leaning up or down
And all the shouting voices
Try to throw me off my course
Some by sermon, some by force
Fools and thieves are dangerous
In the temple and market place

Like a forest bows to winter
Beneath the deep white silence
I will quietly resist

Like a flower in the desert
That only blooms at night
I will quietly resist”
― Rush

“Are we alone? Over time, you will come up with various answers to that same nagging question. Eventually one day it will occur to you that this endless asking is the answer you have been looking for.

“Here's another poem,
like all others before and after,
dedicated to you.
There isn't anything left to be said
but I will spend my life
trying to put you into words.
You who is every goodness,
every optimism
and hope.
Your love is a better fate for me
than anything I could wish for.
If you are a part of me,
then you’re the best part.
And if you're separate from me,
then you are my destination.
But I’ve become a weary traveller,
so please,
let us never be apart.”

“But miracles are not for the asking; they come only when the stern eyes of God droop shut for a moment, and Our Lady takes advantage of His inattention to grant an illicit mercy.

“The parent is protector and trainer, but never the ultimate teacher. Every parent is responsible for teaching their kid basic moral conduct, manners, the difference between love and hate, and right from wrong. However, after maturity, the child must set off to seek knowledge on their own. Religion is never to be forced. And you cannot threaten your child with hell and tell them your religion is the only right way. There is no one right way. The many ways to the Creator are as varied as the colors of a rainbow.”
― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem

“If I were to believe in God enough to call him a murderer, then I might also believe enough that he, as a spirit, exists beyond death; and therefore only he could do it righteously. For the physical being kills a man and hatefully sends him away, whereas God, the spiritual being, kills a man and lovingly draws him nigh.”
― Criss Jami, Healology

“There are two missions we are obligated to carry out during our life journey. The first, is to seek Truth throughout our lifetime. The second, is simply to be good. Engrave it in your mind that life is just one big board game where you have to make it from start to finish by being good. That is all you have to do. The hardest part, is dealing with all the obstacles that prevent smooth sailing. The trick is, to always strive to be the right person in all situations – regardless of personal cost to you. Your aim is to make sure the right book on your shoulder weighs more that the bad book on the left. The scales are real. Regardless of your chosen faith, there is a measurement system to be found in all of the world's religions. After all, does it make sense for all souls, good or bad, to end up in the same place? Of course not. To really secure the very best setting in the afterlife, the vibrations of your good deeds must surpass your death.”

“If we rely on anything else besides faith to maintain the practice of the presence of God, we will certainly fail, whether this is our feelings, or experiences, or sincerity, or good intentions, or reasonings, or plans. The reason these things will fail while faith will not fail is that all these things depend on us, while faith depends on God. It is a gift of God.”

“I don't trust people. The good part is, i don't really have to. I've surrendered my faith to the Higher power, and it's unconditional love for me. Who am i to question it's motives?

“And here she was. Lying on the floor of a dusty, empty, locked room thinking how grateful she felt.

She smiled, though it hurt tremendously to do so, thinking how blessed she had been to have spent twelve years with the most precious gifts from God. She felt honored that they called her mother. She knew she had done the best she could teaching them about life and love, faith and family.

“Faith is the surrender of the mind, it's the surrender of reason, it's the surrender of the only thing that makes us different from other animals. It's our need to believe and to surrender our skepticism and our reason, our yearning to discard that and put all our trust or faith in someone or something, that is the sinister thing to me. ... Out of all the virtues, all the supposed virtues, faith must be the most overrated”
― Christopher Hitchens

“No stars gleam as brightly as those which glisten in the polar sky. No water tastes so sweet as that which springs amid the desert sand. And no faith is so precious as that which lives and triumphs through adversity. Tested faith brings experience.

“Faith is a quiet certainty that there is both a higher purpose to life and a higher power that oversees that purpose. Faith is knowing that we do not have to go it alone during our darkest hours and, even when we feel utterly victimized and weak, there is still something brighter, purer, and more potent than anything we can imagine that cares enough to reach out and offer a shoulder for us to lean upon. The object of faith takes many forms and many names, but the universal truth is faith itself.”

“It is a part of our nature to survive. Faith is an instinctive response to aspects of existence that we cannot explain by any other means, be it the moral void we perceive in the universe, the certainty of death, the mystery of the origin of things, the meaning of our lives, or the absence of meaning. These are basic and extremely simple aspects of existence, but our limitations prevent us from responding in an unequivocal way and for that reason we generate an emotional response, as a defense mechanism. It's pure biology.”

“Authentic faith leads us to treat others with unconditional seriousness and to a loving reverence for the mystery of the human personality. Authentic Christianity should lead to maturity, personality, and reality. It should fashion whole men and women living lives of love and communion. False, manhandled religion produces the opposite effect. Whenever religion shows contempt or disregards the rights of persons, even under the noblest pretexts, it draws us away from reality and God.”

“God has arranged strange ways for some of us to find him. Sometimes He brings us on long physical journeys; sometimes He leaves us at home and makes the journey internal. Yours has been both.

― Abigail J. Hartman, The Soldier's Cross

“Thus Milton refines the question down to a matter of faith," said Coleridge, bringing the lecture to a close, "and a kind of faith more independent, autonomous - more truly strong, as a matter of fact - than the Puritans really sought. Faith, he tells us, is not an exotic bloom to be laboriously maintained by the exclusion of most aspects of the day to day world, nor a useful delusion to be supported by sophistries and half-truths like a child's belief in Father Christmas - not, in short, a prudently unregarded adherence to a constructed creed; but rather must be, if anything, a clear-eyed recognition of the patterns and tendencies, to be found in every piece of the world's fabric, which are the lineaments of God. This is why religion can only be advice and clarification, and cannot carry any spurs of enforcement - for only belief and behavior that is independently arrived at, and then chosen, can be praised or blamed. This being the case, it can be seen as a criminal abridgement of a person's rights willfully to keep him in ignorance of any facts - no piece can be judged inadmissible, for the more stones, both bright and dark, that are added to the mosaic, the clearer is our picture of God.”

“The force that played havoc with the cortisol in my blood was the same force that helped my body recover; if I felt better one day and worse the next, it was unchanged. It chose no side. It gave the girl next to me in the hospital pneumonia; it also gave her white blood cells that would resist the infection. And the atoms in those cells, and the nuclei in those atoms, the same bits of carbon that were being spun into new planets in some corner of space without a name. My insignificance had become unspeakably beautiful to me. That unified force was a god too massive, too inhuman, to resist with the atheism in which I had been brought up.

“Real faith comes when you facing a problem you can't help, you can't change, and you can't work it out”
― Cynthia A. Patterson, It Had to Happen

“Sometimes asking God for a reason for something is like asking Him why the sky is blue. There is a complex, scientific reason for it, Claire, but most children, including you, are content with knowing it is blue because it is. If we understood everything about everything, we would have no need for faith.”
― Susan Meissner, Why the Sky Is Blue

“You didn’t just automatically become a Christian, did you? You weren’t made a Christian by just going to church. Just like you are not made a car by sitting in a garage all day! You have to make a decision.”

“So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you can't prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with animals or the story without animals?' Mr. Okamoto: 'That's an interesting question?' Mr. Chiba: 'The story with animals.' Mr. Okamoto: 'Yes. The story with animals is the better story.' Pi Patel: 'Thank you. And so it goes with God.”
― Yann Martel

“Regardless of your faith, you can never escape uncertainty.”
― Shannon L. Alder

“Faith is about going through hell, coming out with some scars, and becoming a wiser person from the lessons you’ve learned along the way. You must take the scars of your past and appreciate them for what they have taught you. You also have to take the scars, the lessons of your past and not let them control your future….”
― James A. Murphy, The Waves of Life Quotes and Daily Meditations

“If I could take a bite of the whole world
And feel it on my palate
I’d be more happy for a minute or so...
But I don’t always want to be happy.
Sometimes you have to be
Unhappy to be natural...

Not every day is sunny.
When there’s been no rain for a while, you pray for it to come.
So I take unhappiness with happiness
Naturally, like someone who doesn’t find it strange
That there are mountains and plains
And that there are cliffs and grass...

What you need is to be natural and calm
In happiness and in unhappiness,
To feel like someone seeing,
To think like someone walking,
And when it’s time to die, remember the day dies,
And the sunset is beautiful, and the endless night is beautiful...
That’s how it is and that’s how it should be...”
― Alberto Caeiro, The Keeper of Sheep

You can begin to focus on what you want to achieve and make it happen”

“All over India, all over the world, as the sun or the shadow of darkness moves from east to west, the call to prayer moves with it, and people kneel down in a wave to pray to God. Five waves each day - one for each namaaz - ripple across the globe from longitude to longitude. The component elements change direction, like iron filings near a magnet - towards the house of God in Mecca.”
― Vikram Seth, A Suitable Boy

“Trees endure the hot sun and rainstorms by sending their roots down deeper. The adversity they face is eventually the source of great stability.

“It comes down to 'fear' and 'faith'. 'Fear' of what stands in front of me. 'Faith' in believing that the resources I possess can handle what stands in front of me. If I stop at the former, I will change nothing. If I embrace the latter, I can change everything.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“Kuamini (mbali na imani, ambayo ni nia ya kujua kisichoweza kujulikana) ni kwa ajili ya vitu usivyoweza kuvielezea. Unaamini kwamba siku moja dawa ya UKIMWI au saratani itapatikana mahali fulani, ilhali huwezi kufanya majaribio ya kisayansi kulithibitisha hilo. Unaweza kusubiri hata miaka mia, lakini kama bado dawa haijapatikana, unaweza kusubiri hata miaka mingine mia. Kuamini ni kujifanya kujua (na mara nyingi kujifanya kujua ni uongo) na kuamini hakuhitaji maarifa. Kujua kunahitaji maarifa na ni kuamini unakoweza kukuthibitisha. Ukiniuliza kama simu yangu ipo mfukoni nitakwambia ndiyo ipo, kwa sababu nitaingiza mkono mfukoni na kuitoa na kuiona. Siamini kama ipo mfukoni, najua.”

“In the beginning there was faith - which is childish; trust - which is vain; and illusion - which is dangerous.”
― Elie Wiesel, Night

“The faithful man perceives nothing less than opportunity in difficulties. Flowing through his spine, faith and courage work together: Such a man does not fear losing his life, thus he will risk losing it at times in order to empower it. By this he actually values his life more than the man who fears losing his life. It is much like leaping from a window in order to avoid a fire yet in that most crucial moment knowing that God will appear to catch you.”
― Criss Jami, Killosophy

― Megan Chance, The Spiritualist

“I mean that we here are on the wrong side of the tapestry,' answered Father Brown. 'The things that happen here do not seem to mean anything; they mean something somewhere else. Somewhere else retribution will come on the real offender. Here it often seems to fall on the wrong person.”

“Men do not turn from God so easily. Not so easily. Deep in each man is the knowledge that something knows of his existence. Something knows, and cannot e fled nor hid from. To imagine otherwise is to imagine the unspeakable. It was never that this man ceased to believe in God. No. It was rather that he came to believe terrible things of him.”

“Is it not by learning to read the book of nature with the eyes of faith that we come to recognize the drop of divinity that resides in our own souls though hidden, master? In the end is this not faith; to seek the light that takes us further, the light of Christ that brings that to which reason and knowledge alone can never raise itself? This is truth!”

― Solange nicole

“Surely we cannot take an open question like the supernatural and shut it with a bang, turning the key of the madhouse on all the mystics of history. You cannot take the region of the unknown and calmly say that, though you know nothing about it, you know all the gates are locked. We do not know enough about the unknown to know that it is unknowable.”
― G.K. Chesterton

“Some people say it is a shame. Others even imply that it would have been better if the baby had never been created. But the short time I had with my child is precious to me. It is painful to me, but I still wouldn't wish it away. I prayed that God would bless us with a baby. Each child is a gift, and I am proud that we cooperated with God in the creation of a new soul for all eternity. Although not with me, my baby lives.”

“If the whole universe can be found in our own body and mind, this is where we need to make our inquires. We all have the answers within ourselves, we just have not got in touch with them yet. The potential of finding the truth within requires faith in ourselves.”

“You have to believe what you're saying if you're going to convince me. I just can't break that rule, even if I want to.”
― Ashly Lorenzana

“Faith is always coveted most and needed most urgently where will is lacking; for will, as the affect of command, is the decisive sign of sovereignty and strength. In other words, the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands, who commands severely—a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience. From this one might perhaps gather that the two world religions, Buddhism and Christianity, may have owed their origin and above all their sudden spread to a tremendous collapse and disease of the will. And that is what actually happened: both religions encountered a situation in which the will had become diseased, giving rise to a demand that had become utterly desperate for some "thou shalt." Both religions taught fanaticism in ages in which the will had become exhausted, and thus they offered innumerable people some support, a new possibility of willing, some delight in willing. For fanaticism is the only "strength of the will" that even the weak and insecure can be brought to attain, being a sort of hypnotism of the whole system of the senses and the intellect for the benefit of an excessive nourishment (hypertrophy) of a single point of view and feeling that henceforth becomes dominant— which the Christian calls his faith. Once a human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he must be commanded, he becomes "a believer."

Conversely, one could conceive of such a pleasure and power of self-determination, such a freedom of the will [ This conception of "freedom of the will" ( alias, autonomy) does not involve any belief in what Nietzsche called "the superstition of free will" in section 345 ( alias, the exemption of human actions from an otherwise universal determinism).] that the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty, being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities and dancing even near abysses. Such a spirit would be the free spirit par excellence.”
― Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science

“A voice said, "Climb." And he said, "How shall I climb?the mountains are so steep that I cannot climb."
The voice said, "Climb or die."
He said, "But how?I see no way up those steep ascents. This that is asked is too hard for me."
The voice said, "Climb, or perish, soul and body of theemind and spirit of thee. There is no second chance for any son of man. Climb or die."
Then he remembered that he had read in the books of the bravest climbers on the hills of the earth that sometimes they were aware of the presence of a Companion on the mountains who was not one of the earthly party of climbers.

And he rememberd a word in the Book of Mountaineers...it heartened him,for it told him that he was created to walk in precarious places, not on the easy levels of life.”
― Amy Carmichael, A Very Present Help: Life Messages of Great Christans

“There is no doubt that the United States has much to atone for, both domestically and abroad...To produce this horrible confection at home, start with our genocidal treatment of the Native Americans, add a couple hundred years of slavery, along with our denial of entry to Jewish refugees fleeing the death camps of the Third Reich, stir in our collusion with a long list of modern despots and our subsequent disregard for their appalling human rights records, add our bombing of Cambodia and the Pentagon Papers to taste, and then top with our recent refusals to sign the Kyoto protocol for greenhouse emissions, to support any ban on land mines, and to submit ourselves to the rulings of the International Criminal Court. The result should smell of death, hypocrisy, and fresh brimstone.”
― Sam Harris, The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason

“The risk is too great. A man cannot place too much faith in any one thing, neither a woman, nor a horse, nor a weapon, nor any single thing.”
― Michael Crichton, Eaters of the Dead

“Tell me,' asked Stas, 'what is a wicked deed?' 'If anyone takes away Kali's cow,' he answered after a brief reflection, 'that then is a wicked deed.' 'Excellent!' exclaimed Stas, 'and what is a good one?' This time the answer came without any reflection: 'If Kali takes away the cow of somebody else, that is a good deed.' Stas was too young to perceive that similar views of evil and good deeds were enunciated in Europe not only by politicians but by whole nations.”
― Henryk Sienkiewicz, In Desert and Wilderness

“Man’s glory lies not, Lincoln thought, in ‘his goodness,’ for this is often nonexistent. He derives glory, instead, from his being made in the image of the Living God.”
― Joe Wheeler, Abraham Lincoln, a Man of Faith and Courage: Stories of Our Most Admired President

“Now I think ultimately our hope is certainly that people can feel and taste the goodness of God and to find the salvation in Jesus's love and sacrifice. Sometimes the biggest barrier to that has been Christians and has been a Church that is numb to the poverty of the world or just sees our Christianity as a ticket into heaven while ignoring the hells of the world around us. And we're not willing to settle for that kind of Christianity. We believe in a kingdom that begins now and that the kingdom of God Jesus preached is not just something we're to go to when we die but that we're to bring down on earth as it is in heaven.”
― Shane Claiborne

“This in essence is my goal. To set an example by doing what is good. If I live openly and honestly, I set an example of virtue, humanness, restoration, and healing. I give others permission to join me on my journey despite the fear of failure or the rejection it might elicit when they know they are not alone in their experience. The more of us who amass the courage to embark openly on this path, the more normal this experience becomes, effectively eliminating the tactic of shame and isolation that the enemy so often uses to cause us to falter.”
― Riisa Renee, Breaking the Silence

“Faith is not a feeling, she says. It's a set of actions. By taking the actions, you demonstrate more faith than somebody who actually has experienced the rewards of prayer and so feels hope.”
― Mary Karr

“Pain anguish and suffering in human life are always in proportion to the strength with which a man is endowed. We will not pretend to say that Heaven always apportions to a man's capability of endurance the anguish with which he afflicts him...Suffering is in proportion to the strength which has been accorded in other words the weak suffer more where the trial is the same than the strong.”
― Alexandre Dumas, The Man in the Iron Mask

“God is writing His story on the pages of our lives.”
― Rick Anderson

“Holding his daughter close with one arm, he pointed toward the distant horizon. "As far as you can see—it all belongs to you, Faith. Someday, I'll take you to the top of a windmill and teach you to dream. When you reach for some of those dreams, you might fall…but your mother and I will be there to catch you because that's what love means: always being there. I love you, little girl." He pressed a kiss to his daughter's cheek. "So much…it hurts. But I reckon that's part of love, too."

-Dallas”
― Lorraine Heath, Texas Glory

“Those who find no humor in faith are probably those who find the church a refuge for their own black way of looking at life, although I think many of us find the church a refuge for a lot of our personality faults. Those of us, for example, who never learned to dance feel that the church is an ideal place for us if we can find a church that doesn't believe in dancing. Then we can get away with never having learned how to dance. You can carry this in all sorts of directions and see that the church is a refuge for what is really a 'flaw' in your own makeup.”

“We believe that faith is the cure that heals all troubles.”

“just show a little humility. If you know your weaknesses you will not be enslaved by them.”
― Fiorella de Maria, Poor Banished Children

“[Knowing God]... call it love, yes, only that can sound too emotional, or call it faith, and that can sound too cerebral. And what is it? Both, and neither... [its] the decision to be faithful, the patient refusal of easy gratifications... of Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane and on the cross, that bloody crown of love and faith. That is how I learn finally of a God who will not be fitted into my catergories and expectations... the living truth too great for me to see, trusting that He will see and judge and yet not turn me away... That is the mercy which will never give us, or even let us be content with less than itself and less than the truth... we have seen the truth enacted in our own world as mercy, grace and hope, as Jesus, the only-begotten, full of grace and truth..”

“My true religion, my faith in God. He gives me love and compassion. I simply return them by loving and being compassionate towards others. Our own heart, our own mind, is the temple of God.

― Ann Marie Aguilar

“When in darkness....strike a match”
― John Paul Warren

“I tried to convince myself once, when I was a teenager, that I felt God. Alone in the sanctuary, accompanying my mom on an evening errand to the church. I stared at the ceiling and drew deep breath as quickly as I could. I told our youth minister in his ball cap that I had felt Him. That I was blessed.

But in the end, it was only the wind and the rain, making noise in the darkness.”
― Darin Bradley, Noise

“Someone has said,”Education is going from an unconscious to conscious awareness of one’s ignorance.”..No one has a corner on wisdom. All the name-dropping in the world does not heighten the significance of our character. If anything, it reduces it. Our acute need is to cultivate a willingness to learn and to remain teachable.”
― Charles Swindoll

“Theology, philosophy, metaphysics, and quantum physics are merely ways for God to have his smart people believe in him”
― Jeremy Aldana

“When God has specially promised the thing, we are bound to believe we shall recieve it when we pray for it. You have no right to put in an 'if', and say, 'Lord, if it be thy will..." This is to insult God. To put an 'if' in God's promise when God has put none there, is tantamount to charging God with being insincere.”
― Charles G. Finney

“It is easier for a Russian to become an Atheist, than for any other nationality in the world. And not only does a Russian 'become an Atheist,' but he actually BELIEVES IN Atheism, just as though he had found a new faith, not perceiving that he has pinned his faith to a negation. Such is our anguish of thirst!”
― Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Idiot

“More profoundly, Nihilist "simplification" may be seen in the universal prestige today accorded the lowest order of knowledge, the scientific, as well as the simplistic ideas of men like Marx, Freud, and Darwin, which underlie virtually the whole of contemporary thought and life.

We say "life," for it is important to see that the Nihilist history of our century has not been something imposed from without or above, or at least has not been predominantly this; it has rather presupposed, and drawn its nourishment from, a Nihilist soil that has long been preparing in the hearts of the people. It is precisely from the Nihilism of the commonplace, from the everyday Nihilism revealed in the life and thought and aspiration of the people, that all the terrible events of our century have sprung.
The world-view of Hitler is very instructive in this regard, for in him the most extreme and monstrous Nihilism rested upon the foundation of a quite unexceptional and even typical Realism. He shared the common faith in "science," "progress," and "enlightenment" (though not, of course, in "democracy"), together with a practical materialism that scorned all theology, metaphysics, and any thought or action concerned with any other world than the "here and now," priding himself on the fact that he had "the gift of reducing all problems to their simplest foundations." He had a crude worship of efficiency and utility that freely tolerated "birth control", laughed at the institution of marriage as a mere legalization of a sexual impulse that should be "free", welcomed sterilization of the unfit, despised "unproductive elements" such as monks, saw nothing in the cremation of the dead but a "practical" question and did not even hesitate to put the ashes, or the skin and fat, of the dead to "productive use." He possessed the quasi-anarchist distrust of sacred and venerable institutions, in particular the Church with its "superstitions" and all its "outmoded" laws and ceremonies. He had a naive trust in the "natural mom, the "healthy animal" who scorns the Christian virtues--virginity in particular--that impede the "natural functioning" of the body. He took a simple-minded delight in modern conveniences and machines, and especially in the automobile and the sense of speed and "freedom" it affords.

There is very little of this crude Weltanschauung that is not shared, to some degree, by the multitudes today, especially among the young, who feel themselves "enlightened" and "liberated," very little that is not typically "modern.”
― Seraphim Rose

“There is no great religion without a great schism. All of them have it. And that's because you're dealing with something called faith. And faith is not something you can prove; faith is personal opinion. Uh, when you're dealing with something with certainty, like, y'know, science or logic, you don't have the--there's no wiggle room; that's why history is not filled with warring math cults, y'know, because you can settle the issue; you can prove something to be right or wrong, and that's the end of the argument: next case. Whereas, when you're dealing with faith, you can forever argue your point, or another point, because you're dealing with intangibles. Personally, I think, faith is what you ask of somebody when you don't have the goods to prove your point.”
― Tom Quinn

“If you can admit that you haven't yet understood everything,
faith can fill the emptiness in heart to confront the hesitation.”
― Toba Beta, Betelgeuse Incident: Insiden Bait Al-Jauza

“One, just one, but definitely one of the great benefits of private prayer is that you can’t hide from your motives. In corporate prayer, we can sound like “all that”. We can blow Jesus smoke like nobody’s bizness in a crowd but, get alone with Him, and He won’t let you get away with the fake stuff. Try blowing Jesus smoke in your prayer closet and you’ll cough on it every time. Truth? That penetrating gaze of His hurts, but afterwards, it never fails to heal.”
― Shellie Rushing Tomlinson

“A purposeless virtue is a contradiction in terms. Virtue, like harmony, cannot exist alone; a virtue must lead to harmony between one creature and another. To be good for nothing is just that. If a virtue has been thought a virtue long enough, it must be assumed to have practical justification - though the very longevity that proves its practicality may obscure it. That seems to be what happened with the idea of fidelity...
Our age could be characterized as a manifold experiment in faithlessness, and if it has as yet produced no effective understanding of the practicalities of faith, it has certainly produced massive evidence of the damage and disorder of its absence.
(pg.115-116, "The Body and the Earth")”
― Wendell Berry, The Art of the Commonplace: The Agrarian Essays

“If the church is to survive as a place where head and heart are equal partners in faith, then we will need to commit ourselves once again not to the worship of Christ, but to the imitation of Jesus. His invitation was not to believe, but to follow. (p. 145)”

“For many, the search for Jesus is initiated from experiencing an event in life so powerful, it awakens the dragons of faith; from pain so deep, it calls on the hidden fears of the soul in an effort to survive. For others it means a serious personal life survey that ultimately forces the confrontation with the futility, anesthetics, and despair in their lives.”

“Faith is the door to the full inner life of the Church, a life which includes not only access to an authoritative teaching but above all to a deep personal experience which is at once unique and yet shared by the whole Body of Christ, in the Spirit of Christ.”
― Thomas Merton, Zen and the Birds of Appetite

“My mother believed in God's will for many years. It was af if she had turned on a celestial faucet and goodness kept pouring out. She said it was faith that kept all these good things coming our way, only I thought she said "fate" because she couldn't pronounce the "th" sound in "faith".

And later I discovered that maybe it was fate all along, that faith was just an illusion that somehow you're in control. I found out the most I could have was hope, and with that I wasn't denying any possibility, good or bad. I was just saying, If there is a choice, dear God or whatever you are, here's where the odds should be placed.

I remember the day I started thinking this, it was such a revelation to me. It was the day my mother lost her faith in God. She found that things of unquestioned certainty could never be trusted again.

We had gone to the beach, to a secluded spot south of the city near Devil's Slide. My father had read in Sunset magazine that this was a good place to catch ocean perch. And although my father was not a fisherman but a pharmacist's assistant who had once been a doctor in China, he believed in his nenkan, his ability to do anything he put his mind to. My mother believed she had nenkan to cook anything my father had a mind to catch. It was this belief in their nenkan that had brought my parents to America. It had enabled them to have seven children and buy a house in Sunset district with very little money. It had given them the confidence to believe their luck would never run out, that God was on their side, that house gods had only benevolent things to report and our ancestors were pleased, that lifetime warranties meant our lucky streak would never break, that all the elements were now in balance, the right amount of wind and water.”

“We take it for granted that Jesus was not interested in political life: his mission was purely religious. Indeed we have witnessed . . . the 'iconization' of the life of Jesus: 'This is a Jesus of hieratic, stereotyped gestures, all representing theological themes. In this way, the life of Jesus is no longer a human life, submerged in history, but a theological life -- an icon.”

“The woman had gone down on her knees and was shuffling slowly across the cruel ground towards the group of crosses: the dead baby rocked on her back. When she reached the tallest cross she unhooked the child and held the face against the wood and afterwards the loins: then she crossed herself, not as ordinary Catholics do, but in a curious and complicated pattern which included the nose and ears. Did she expect a miracle? And if she did, why should it not be granted her? the priest wondered. Faith, one was told, could move mountains, and here was faith--faith in the spittle that healed the blind man and the voice that raised the dead. The evening star was out: it hung low down over the edge of the plateau: it looked as if it was within reach: and a small hot wind stirred. The priest found himself watching the child for some movement. When none came, it was as if God had missed an opportunity. The woman sat down, and taking a lump of sugar from her bundle, began to eat, and the child lay quiet at the foot of the cross. Why, after all, should we expect God to punish the innocent with more life?”
― Graham Greene, The Power and the Glory

“Ironically for someone who had so long asserted his own individuality as his first and best defense against insults of any kind, I discovered that faith in myself proved to be the least formidable strength I possessed when confronting alone organized inhumanity on a greater scale than I had conceived possible. Faith in myself was important, and remains important to my self esteem. But I discovered in prison that faith in myself alone, sep0arate from other, more important allegiances , was ultimately no match for the cruelty that human beings could devise when they were entirely unencumbered by respect for the God given dignity of man. This is the lesson I learned in prison. It is, perhaps, the most important lesson I have ever learned.”

“A corollary of this has been that Christians have thought that they should only create art with a Pollyanna quality to it: paintings of birds and kittens, movies that extol family life and end happily, songs that are positive and uplifting – in short, works of art that show a world that is almost unfallen where no one experiences conflict and where sin is naughty rather than wicked.”
― Steve Turner, Imagine: A Vision for Christians in the Arts

“Our witness is only as strong as our freedom is real. We can have the most noble convictions in the world, but if we are snarky and impatient when we don't get our way, those things will interfere with our influence. If we gossip more than we pray, those misspoken words will demolish our influence. If our addictions get in the way of living out our convictions, we'll have mostly a negative influence.”

“The greatest hindrance to growth in faith is comfortable living.”
― John Carey

“Jesus’s use of the phrasing “a new commandment” is frequently scanted in light of its implicit ramifications. Because Jesus at the Last Supper has executed the “new covenant” with his disciples, the Great Commandment itself now acquires an unprecedented meaning. Its new meaning belongs to this sudden revelation not merely about who God is but also about what love is. Previously the Great Commandment bade us to love God and our neighbor. Now this love can be comprehended only in an incarnational situation. Its incarnate presence is the activation of profound rhizomic relations that explode from the center toward the ends of the earth. We are commanded to be incarnational in relation to one another just as God at the cross was incarnational in Christ. . . . We are no longer simply Christ’s “followers" - the pre-Easter form of relation to a master-and-teacher that is conventionally called “disciple” - but also perpetual Christ incarnators . . .”

“Stand like a beaten anvil, when thy dream
Is laid upon thee, golden from the fire.
Flinch not, though heavily through that furnace-gleam
The black forge-hammers fall on thy desire.

Demoniac giants round thee seem to loom.
'Tis but the world-smiths heaving to and fro.
Stand like a beaten anvil. Take the doom
Their ponderous weapons deal thee, blow on blow.

Needful to truth as dew-fall to the flower
Is this wild wrath and this implacable scorn.
For every pang, new beauty, and new power,
Burning blood-red shall on thy heart be born.

Stand like a beaten anvil. Let earth's wrong
Beat on that iron and ring back in song.”
― Alfred Noyes, Collected Poems Complete

“If you saturate your mind with positive thoughts, it will sustain you in any situation.”
― Lailah Gifty Akita, Pearls of Wisdom: Great mind

“Your faith is your conscience, and your conscience is your faith. You cannot have faith without a conscience, but you can have a conscience without faith. Man was designed to be good with or without religion, yet the challenge for many is staying good. Some people claim to be religious but have no conscience, while some people without religion are very much aware of their conscience. Therefore, a religious label does not define your character or validate your worth. In the end, all men will be judged by the amount of truth in them and the weight of their hearts. The heavier the conscience, the heavier the truth. The lighter the heart, the higher it goes. The only spiritual currency one has in the afterlife is amassed in the form of light, in that, the amount you have depends on the weight of your words and deeds in the living. Conscience is everything. Conscience is what connects us to the truth and light of the highest power source of all. God. The cosmic heart of the universe.”

“An ironic religion -- one that never claims to be absolutely true but only professes to be relatively beautiful, and never promises salvation but only proposes it as a salubrious idea. A century ago there were people who thought art was the thing that could fuse the terms of this seemingly insuperable oxymoron, and no doubt art is part of the formula. But maybe consumerism also has something to teach us about forging an ironic religion -- a lesson about learning to choose, about learning the power and consequences, for good or ill, of our ever-expanding palette of choices. Perhaps . . . the day will come when the true ironic religion is found, the day when humanity is filled with enough love and imagination and responsibility to become its own god and make a paradise of its world, a paradise of all the right choices.”

“Take faith, for example. For many people in our world, the opposite of faith is doubt. The goal, then, within this understanding, is to eliminate doubt. But faith and doubt aren't opposites. Doubt is often a sign that your faith has a pulse, that it's alive and well and exploring and searching. Faith and doubt aren't opposites, they are, it turns out, excellent dance partners.”

“Faith?” The word popped out before I could think about it. “Faith in what? A higher power? The gods?

“Christian love draws no distinction between one enemy and another, except that the more bitter our enemy's hatred, the greater his need of love. Be his enmity political or religious, he has nothing to expect from a follower of Jesus but unqualified love. In such love there is not inner discord between the private person and official capacity. In both we are disciples of Christ, or we are not Christians at all.”
― Dietrich Bonhoeffer, The Cost of Discipleship

“Do you think I care if Aslan dooms me to death?” said the King. “That would be nothing, nothing at all.

“I used to believe in so many things—elves and leprechauns, virgins riding unicorns. I trusted that the world was made up of people who were generally good, though they may have lost their way temporarily. The faith my mother gave me—the words she whispered when she said good night, the idea that gave me hope for the two of us even when we fought bitterly over trivial things, as mothers and daughters do, I guess—was her belief in love, a love so unconditional we could barely scratch at the edges of comprehending it.”

“Imagine a land where people are afraid of dragons. It is a reasonable fear: dragons possess a number of qualities that make being afraid of them a very commendable response. Things like their terrible size, their ability to spout fire, or to crack boulders into splinters with their massive talons. In fact, the only terrifying quality that dragons do not possess is that of existence.

Now, the people of this land know about dragons because their leaders have warned them about them. They tell stories about cruel dragons with razor teeth and fiery breath. They recount legends of dragons hunting by night on silent wings. In short, the leaders make sure that the people believe in all the qualities of dragons, including that key quality of existence. And then they control the people — when they need to — with their fear of dragons. The people pay a dragon-slaying tax … everyone stays indoors after dark to avoid being snatched by swooping claws … and nobody ever strays out of bounds for fear of being eaten well and truly up.

Perhaps somebody will wonder if dragons aren’t, after all, fictitious because — despite their size — nobody seems to have actually seen one. And so it is necessary from time to time to provide evidence: a burnt tree or two, a splintered rock, the mysterious absence of a villager. The population is controlled by the dragons in its collective mind. It’s contrived superstition, and it is possible because the people do not know enough about the way the world works to know that dragons do not exist.”

“Through the darkest hours of the night

“There's one other thing I'd like to remind you of, my dear. There've been many times when you've sworn to me that after all that life has dealt you, it was no longer possible for you to believe in anything. I replied that both life and my studies had led me to the same conclusion. I asked you, 'What is a person permitted, once he's realized that truth is unattainable and consequently doesn't exist for him?' Do you remember your answer?"
"I do, ibn Sabbah. I said something like this: 'If a person realized that everything people call happiness, love and joy was just a miscalculation based on a false premise, he'd feel a horrible emptiness inside. The only thing that could rouse him from his paralysis would be to gamble with his own face and the face of others. The person capable of that would be permitted anything.”

“As prayer without faith is but a beating of the air, so trust without prayer [is] but a presumptuous bravado. He that promises to give, and bids us trust His promises, commands us to pray, and expects obedience to his commands. He will give, but not without our asking.”
― Thomas Lye

“God is not someone you meet when you die. His smiling face will be the first and the most familiar to greet you on the other side of mortality. You’ll recognize Him and know in your heart of hearts that you’re not entering a new sphere, but returning home to the place you’ve always belonged.”

“Boy you really missed the boat. I’ll make it simple, so’s even fuckin you can understand. Papa God growed us up till we could wear long pants; then he licensed his name to dollar bills, left some car keys on the table, and got the fuck outta town”. Water rushes to his eye-holes. “Don’t be lookin up at no sky for help. Look down here, at us twisted dreamers”. He takes hold of my shoulders, spins me around, and punches me towards the mirror on the wall. “You’re the God. Take responsibility. Exercise your power”

“We are spiritual children of God the Father. We preach it. We sing it. But do we really understand it? Sometimes it’s easy to tell others they are loved, but not so easy to believe it of ourselves — not because we don’t think God loves His children, but because we may feel undeserving of His love. The adversary loves to remind us who we are not. Not pretty. Not smart. Not strong. But God would not have sacrificed His Son to save us if we aren’t worth saving.”
― Toni Sorenson, Women of Christ: Of Infinite Worth

“Ah, but it is an interesting thing, that these things can so seldom be proved. If I were to perform some piece of, hrmf, magic for you, here in this room, you would claim a thousand ways it could have been done. Indeed, those ways might be exceedingly unlikely, but you would cling to them rather than accept the, mmn, the chance that magic, the eternal inexplicable, might be the true agent, and if you were strong enough in yourself, unafraid, unthreatened, here in your own chambers, well perhaps there would be no magic worked at all. It is a subjective force, you see, whereas the physical laws of the artificers are objective. A gear-train will turn without faith, but magic may not. And so, when your people demand, mmn, proof, there is none, but when you have forgotten and dismissed it, then magic creeps back into the gaps where you do not look for it.”

“The darker side of the City tried to emphasize the selfish parts of me by encouraging my sense of entitlement and my desire for personal space.

“You are all soldiers of Christ," he said, "and now is an opportunity given to you to show that you are worthy soldiers. When the troops of a worldly monarch go into battle they do so with head erect, with proud and resolute bearing, with flashing eye, and with high courage, determined to bear aloft his banner and to crown it with victory, even though it cost them their lives. Such is the mien that soldiers of Christ should bear in the mortal strife now raging round us. Let them show the same fearlessness of death, the same high courage, the same unlimited confidence in their Leader. What matter if they die in His service? He has told them what their work should be. He has bidden them visit the sick and comfort the sorrowing. What if there be danger in the work? Did He shrink from the Cross which was to end His work of love, and is it for His followers to do so? 'Though you go down into the pit,' He has said, 'I am there also'; and with His companionship one must be craven indeed to tremble. This is a noble opportunity for holding high the banner of Christ. There is work to be done for all, and as the work is done, men should see by the calm courage, the cheerfulness, and the patience of those that do it, that they know that they are doing His work, and that they are content to leave the issue, whatever it be, in His hands.”

“I take leave to contradict those who say that salvation is an evolution! All that ever can be evolved out of the sinful heart of man is sin-and nothing else!

“For when God is said by these things to try men and prove them, to see what is in their hearts and whether they will keep His commandments or no, we are not to understand, that it is for His own information, or that He may obtain evidence Himself of their sincerity (for he needs no trials for His information); but chiefly for their conviction, and to exhibit evidence to their consciences...
So when God tempted or tried Abraham with that difficult command of offering up his son, it was not for His satisfaction, whether he feared God or no, but for Abraham's own greater satisfaction and comfort, and the more clear manifestation of the favour of God to him.”

(The above made up by professional hope experts, you might say, because willful, voluntary, intentional hope was the only kind they had in anything like long supply. Faith is not, contrary to the usual ideas, something that turns out to be right or wrong, like a gambler's bet; it's an act, an intention, a project, something that makes you, in leaping into the future, go so far, far, far ahead that you shoot clean out of Time and right into Eternity, which is not the end of time or a whole lot of time or unending time, but timelessness, that old Eternal Now. So that you end up living not in the future ((in your intentional "act of faith")) but in the present. After all.

(Courage is willful hope.)”

“I’M LOSING FAITH IN MY FAVORITE COUNTRY

Throughout my life, the United States has been my favorite country, save and except for Canada, where I was born, raised, educated, and still live for six months each year. As a child growing up in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, I aggressively bought and saved baseball cards of American and National League players, spent hours watching snowy images of American baseball and football games on black and white television and longed for the day when I could travel to that great country. Every Saturday afternoon, me and the boys would pay twelve cents to go the show and watch U.S. made movies, and particularly, the Superman serial. Then I got my chance. My father, who worked for B.F. Goodrich, took my brother and me to watch the Cleveland Indians play baseball in the Mistake on the Lake in Cleveland. At last I had made it to the big time. I thought it was an amazing stadium and it was certainly not a mistake. Amazingly, the Americans thought we were Americans.

I loved the United States, and everything about the country: its people, its movies, its comic books, its sports, and a great deal more. The country was alive and growing. No, exploding. It was the golden age of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The American dream was alive and well, but demanded hard work, honesty, and frugality. Everyone understood that. Even the politicians.

Then everything changed.

Partly because of its proximity to the United States and a shared heritage, Canadians also aspired to what was commonly referred to as the American dream. I fall neatly into that category. For as long as I can remember I wanted a better life, but because I was born with a cardboard spoon in my mouth, and wasn’t a member of the golden gene club, I knew I would have to make it the old fashioned way: work hard and save. After university graduation I spent the first half of my career working for the two largest oil companies in the world: Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell. The second half was spent with one of the smallest oil companies in the world: my own.

Then I sold my company and retired into obscurity. In my case obscurity was spending summers in our cottage on Lake Rosseau in Muskoka, Ontario, and winters in our home in Port St. Lucie, Florida. My wife, Ann, and I, (and our three sons when they can find the time), have been enjoying that “obscurity” for a long time. During that long time we have been fortunate to meet and befriend a large number of Americans, many from Tom Brokaw’s “Greatest Generation.” One was a military policeman in Tokyo in 1945. After a very successful business carer in the U.S. he’s retired and living the dream. Another American friend, also a member of the “Greatest Generation”, survived The Battle of the Bulge and lived to drink Hitler’s booze at Berchtesgaden in 1945. He too is happily retired and living the dream. Both of these individuals got to where they are by working hard, saving, and living within their means. Both also remember when their Federal Government did the same thing.

One of my younger American friends recently sent me a You Tube video, featuring an impassioned speech by Marco Rubio, Republican senator from Florida. In the speech, Rubio blasts the spending habits of his Federal Government and deeply laments his country’s future. He is outraged that the U.S. Government spends three hundred billion dollars, each and every month. He is even more outraged that one hundred and twenty billion of that three hundred billion dollars is borrowed. In other words, Rubio states that for every dollar the U.S. Government spends, forty cents is borrowed. I don’t blame him for being upset. If I had run my business using that arithmetic, I would be in the soup kitchens. If individual American families had applied that arithmetic to their finances, none of them would be in a position to pay a thin dime of taxes.”

“Life is a misery, death an uncertainty. Suppose it steals suddenly upon me, in what state shall I leave this world? When can I learn what I have here neglected to learn? Or is it true that death will cut off and put an end to all care and all feeling? This is something to be inquired into.

But no, this cannot be true. It is not for nothing, it is not meaningless that all over the world is displayed the high and towering authority of the Christian faith.

Such great and wonderful things would never have been done for us by God, if the life of the soul were to end with the death of the body. Why then do I delay? Why do I not abandon my hopes of this world and devote myself entirely to the search for God and for the happy life?”
― Augustine of Hippo, Confessions

“True virtue never appears so lovely as when it is most oppressed; and the divine excellency of real Christianity is never exhibited with such advantage as when under the greatest trials; then it is that true faith appears much more precious than gold, and upon this account is "found to praise and honour and glory.”
― Jonathan Edwards, The Religious Affections

“Dead men cannot take effective action; their power of influence on others lasts only till the grave. Deeds and actions that energise others belong only to the living. Well, then, look at the facts in this case. The Saviour is working mightily among men, every day He is invisibly persuading numbers of people all over the world, both within and beyond the Greek-speaking world, to accept His faith and be obedient to His teaching. Can anyone, in face of this, still doubt that He has risen and lives, or rather that He is Himself the Life? Does a dead man prick the consciences of men...?”
― St. Athanasius, On the Incarnation

“God remains silent so that men and women may speak, protest, and struggle. God remains silent so that people may really become people. When God is silent and men and women cry, God cries in solidarity with them but doesn't intervene. God waits for the shouts of protest.”

“...there is therefore now no condemnation for two reasons: you are dead now; and God, as the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, has been dead all along. The blame game was over before it started. It really was. All Jesus did was announce that truth and tell you it would make you free. It was admittedly a dangerous thing to do. You are a menace. Be he did it; and therefore, menace or not, here you stand: uncondemned, forever, now. What are you going to do with your freedom?”
― Robert Farrar Capon, Between Noon & Three: Romance, Law & the Outrage of Grace

“Our obedience is God's pleasure when it proves that God is our treasure. This is good news, because it means very simply that the command to obey is the command to be happy in God. The commandments of God are only as hard to obey as the promises of God are hard to believe. The Word of God is only as hard to obey as the beauty of God is hard to cherish.”

“Nothing will unfold for us unless we move toward what

“In all of knowable reality, God is unique. He is knowable not like the multiplication table or the table of elements; he alone is knowable as the one totally in control of being known. He is not at the disposal of the human mind. He is known when he wills to be known. Yet he is known in and through created reality, which is known naturally. Therefore the glory of God is exalted most not when we know God apart from observation and reading and study, but when we know God as a result of his free and gracious self-revelation in and through our earnest observation of and meditation on his work and Word in history.”
― John Piper, The Pleasures of God: Meditations on God's Delight in Being God

“In the pragmatist, streetwise climate of advanced postmodern capitalism, with its scepticism of big pictures and grand narratives, its hard-nosed disenchantment with the metaphysical, 'life' is one among a whole series of discredited totalities. We are invited to think small rather than big – ironically, at just the point when some of those out to destroy Western civilization are doing exactly the opposite. In the conflict between Western capitalism and radical Islam, a paucity of belief squares up to an excess of it. The West finds itself faced with a full-blooded metaphysical onslaught at just the historical point that it has, so to speak, philosophically disarmed. As far as belief goes, postmodernism prefers to travel light: it has beliefs, to be sure, but it does not have faith.”

“To come to faith on the basis of experience alone is unwise, though not so foolish as to reject faith altogether because of lack of experience ... the quality of a Christian's experience depends on the quality of his faith, just as the quality of his faith depends in turn on the quality of his understanding of God's truth.”

“I saw that, although they were at the mercy of the sweltering heat, or the pains of aging or poverty, they could tolerate these because their faith gave them the hope of being united in spirit with a supernatural presence.

I still denied that presence. My denial, I was realizing, was my armor; it allowed me to deflect a barrage of difficult questions. But it didn't answer those questions. It protected me from charlatans, yes, but it didn't fill my emptiness or give me direction. Doubt served a purpose, but it also prevented me from trusting anyone or anything. Without trust, how could I ever be happy?”

“Although I'm an atheist, I try not to crap all over people's belief in God. It may be nothing more than a placebo, a fairy tale that gives the hopeless hope, but sometimes a little hope is all people need to get through the day. Imagine a unit of soldiers under heavy enemy fire. They are told by their superiors to hold their position, even in the face of overwhelming fire power. The soldiers are being told that reinforcements are on the way, and that thought alone gives them the hope and courage to continue fighting, even if ultimately the reinforcements never arrive. I think some people simply need to believe that God is sending them reinforcements, to get through another day.”
― Oliver Gaspirtz

“Girls aside, the other thing I found in the last few years of being at school, was a quiet, but strong Christian faith – and this touched me profoundly, setting up a relationship or faith that has followed me ever since.

I am so grateful for this. It has provided me with a real anchor to my life and has been the secret strength to so many great adventures since.

But it came to me very simply one day at school, aged only sixteen.

As a young kid, I had always found that a faith in God was so natural. It was a simple comfort to me: unquestioning and personal.

But once I went to school and was forced to sit through somewhere in the region of nine hundred dry, Latin-liturgical, chapel services, listening to stereotypical churchy people droning on, I just thought that I had got the whole faith deal wrong.

Maybe God wasn’t intimate and personal but was much more like chapel was … tedious, judgemental, boring and irrelevant.

The irony was that if chapel was all of those things, a real faith is the opposite. But somehow, and without much thought, I had thrown the beautiful out with the boring. If church stinks, then faith must do, too.

The precious, natural, instinctive faith I had known when I was younger was tossed out with this newly found delusion that because I was growing up, it was time to ‘believe’ like a grown-up.

I mean, what does a child know about faith?

It took a low point at school, when my godfather, Stephen, died, to shake me into searching a bit harder to re-find this faith I had once known.

Life is like that. Sometimes it takes a jolt to make us sit and remember who and what we are really about.

Stephen had been my father’s best friend in the world. And he was like a second father to me. He came on all our family holidays, and spent almost every weekend down with us in the Isle of Wight in the summer, sailing with Dad and me. He died very suddenly and without warning, of a heart attack in Johannesburg.

I was devastated.

I remember sitting up a tree one night at school on my own, and praying the simplest, most heartfelt prayer of my life.

‘Please, God, comfort me.’

Blow me down … He did.

My journey ever since has been trying to make sure I don’t let life or vicars or church over-complicate that simple faith I had found. And the more of the Christian faith I discover, the more I realize that, at heart, it is simple. (What a relief it has been in later life to find that there are some great church communities out there, with honest, loving friendships that help me with all of this stuff.)

To me, my Christian faith is all about being held, comforted, forgiven, strengthened and loved – yet somehow that message gets lost on most of us, and we tend only to remember the religious nutters or the God of endless school assemblies.

This is no one’s fault, it is just life. Our job is to stay open and gentle, so we can hear the knocking on the door of our heart when it comes.

The irony is that I never meet anyone who doesn’t want to be loved or held or forgiven. Yet I meet a lot of folk who hate religion. And I so sympathize. But so did Jesus. In fact, He didn’t just sympathize, He went much further. It seems more like this Jesus came to destroy religion and to bring life.

This really is the heart of what I found as a young teenager: Christ comes to make us free, to bring us life in all its fullness. He is there to forgive us where we have messed up (and who hasn’t), and to be the backbone in our being.

Faith in Christ has been the great empowering presence in my life, helping me walk strong when so often I feel so weak. It is no wonder I felt I had stumbled on something remarkable that night up that tree.

I had found a calling for my life.”

“Pray each morning and each night.
Talk to God and be polite.
Tell Him what you're grateful for.
Leave your troubles at His door.

Share your wishes, needs, and hopes.
Ask God how to bravely cope.
Tell Him all you learned today.
Say the things you need to say.

Beg forgiveness for your sins.
Pray to live with Him again.
Speak with earnest heart and soul.
He will listen. This I know.

For prayer is hope put to the test.
And hope is faith in what is best.
Faith is power to do great things.
Thus, prayer is faith's enabling wings.”

Belief can impede spiritual unfoldment; faith is supremely necessary for it.”

Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to live as long as God Himself.
Never.”

The word of the Gospel–after all those centuries of trying to lift yourself into heaven by worrying about the perfection of your bootstraps–suddenly turned out to be a flat announcement that the saved were home before they started…Grace has to be drunk straight: no water, no ice, and certainly no ginger ale; neither goodness, nor badness, not the flowers that bloom in the spring of super spirituality could be allowed to enter into the case.”

“Why do many believers insist on repeatedly pointing to the crimes of 20th century dictators who led officially atheistic societies as some sort of evidence of their god's existence? It makes no sense.

If the rivers of blood on Stalin's hands and Mao's hands, for example, are supposed to prove there is a god, then what do the oceans of blood on the hands of several thousand years' worth of religious kings, queens, presidents, popes, priests, generals, Crusadersm jihadists and tribal chiefs prove? It's not, of course, but if bodycount is somehow the measure of a god's likelihood of existence, then believers lose.

It is clear that humans are quite capable of killing with or without images of gods bouncing around in their heads. If anything, however, history suggests that the concept of gods makes the idea of massacring your fellow man (and women and children, too, of course) a lot easier to act upon.”

He said,'Just as there exists in writing a literal truth and a poetic truth, there also exists in a human being a literal anatomy and a poetic anatomy. One, you can see; one, you cannot. One is made of bones and teeth and flesh; the other is made of energy and memory and faith. But they are both equally true”

“I was utterly convinced that an intellectual could never be anything but an intellectual, was simply not capable of being anything else, that his intellectuality would, sooner or later, erode his faith or erode whatever he'd masked it with . . .

“A faith that can only exist in the light of victory and certainty is one which really affirms the self while pretending to affirm Christ, for it only follows Jesus in the belief that Jesus has conquered death.

“I prayed to a mystery.
Sometimes I was simply aware of the mystery. I saw a flash of it during a trip to New York that David and I took before we were married. We were walking on a busy sidewalk in Manhattan. I don't remember if it was day or night. A man with a wound on his forehead came toward us. His damp, ragged hair might have been clotted with blood, or maybe it was only dirt. He wore deeply dirty clothes. His red, swollen hands, cupped in half-fists, swung loosely at his sides. His eyes were focused somewhere past my right shoulder. He staggered while he walked. The sidewalk traffic flowed around him and with him. He was strange and frightening, and at the same time he belonged on the Manhattan sidewalk as much as any of us. It was that paradox -- that he could be both alien and resident, both brutalized and human, that he could stand out in the moving mass of people like a sea monster in a school of tuna and at the same time be as much at home as any of us -- that stayed with me. I never saw him again, but I remember him often, and when I do, I am aware of the mystery.
Years later, I was out on our property on the Olympic Peninsula, cutting a path through the woods. This was before our house was built. After chopping through dense salal and hacking off ironwood bushes for an hour or so, I stopped, exhausted. I found myself standing motionless, intensely aware of all of the life around me, the breathing moss, the chattering birds, the living earth. I was as much a part of the woods as any millipede or cedar tree. At that moment, too, I was aware of the mystery.
Sometimes I wanted to speak to this mystery directly. Out of habit, I began with "Dear God" and ended with "Amen". But I thought to myself, I'm not praying to that old man in the sky. Rather, I'm praying to this thing I can't define. It was sort of like talking into a foggy valley.
Praying into a bank of fog requires alot of effort. I wanted an image to focus on when I prayed. I wanted something to pray *to*. but I couldn't go back to that old man. He was too closely associated with all I'd left behind.”

“That eye which sees anything good in the creature is a blind eye; that eye which fancies it can discern anything in man, or anything in anything he can do to win the Divine favor, is as yet stone blind to the Truth of God, and needs to be lanced and cut, and the cataract of pride removed from it!”

“It took a couple of months before we were both convinced there were no rules about sexual activities in Hell and our spouses were not going to show up out of the blue. It was hard to start a sexual relationship in circumstances of such bizarre uncertainty, especially for an active Mormon and a good Christian, both lost in a Zoroastrian Hell. We were like virgin newlyweds. All my life I’d been raised to believe this kind of thing was wrong. All my life I had lived with a strong sense of morality. How do you give it up? How do you do things you thought you’d never do? Where do all the things you believed go, when all the supporting structure is found to be a myth? How do you know how or on what to take a moral stand, how do you behave when it turns out there are no cosmic rules, no categorical imperatives? It was difficult. So tricky to untangle.”

“Tom has been having a difficult patch, and we meet at the church of IKEA as often as possible, because it is equidistant from our houses and always cheers us up. Yesterday I asked, 'In your depression, and with so many people having such a hard time, where is Advent?' He tried to wiggle out of it by saying, 'You Protestants and your little questions!' Then, when pushed, he said: 'Faith is a decision. Do we believe we are ultimately doomed and fucked and there's no way out? Or that God and goodness make a difference? There is heaven, community, and hope - and hope that there is life beyond the grave.'
'But Tom, at the same time, the grave is very real, dark and cold and lonely.' 'Advent is not for the naive. Because in spite of the dark and cold, we see light - you look up, or you make light, with candles, or with strands of lightbulbs on trees. And you give light. Beauty helps, in art and nature and faces. Friends help. Solidarity helps. If you ask me, when people return phone calls, it's about as good as it gets. And who knows beyond that.”

“In the Judeo-Christian tradition, we carry forward the basic insight our fundamental relationship to the world is one of love. Christians say that “God is Love,” that God created the universe out of love. The source of God’s Creation is love, and our relationship to the possibility of meaning within this created world is in and through love. The Christian community is a reciprocal relationship among subjects who love and are loved. The subject maintains the meaning of God’s Creation by taking up a Christ-like love toward others. The appearance of meaning in the world—love’s product—is always a manifestation of the divine. Liberalism turns away from this entire tradition of thought, in party because of its association with religion, and in part because this tradition resists the analytic form of reason. For liberalism, religion is individualized and privatized, and thus it cannot be used in the explanation or justification of a public space. If it does invade the public, it threatens irrationality. But religion is no less an effort to understand the character of our experience, and even a secular philosophy must not ignore that experience.

“He who has two grounds of trust is lost! He who relies upon two
salvations, and cannot say of Christ, “He is all my salvation and all my desire,” that man is not only in danger of being
lost, but he is already condemned; because, in fact, he believes not on the Son of God! He is not alive to God at all, but rests partly on the Cross, and then in some measure on something else.”
― Charles H. Spurgeon

“Христовият мир е свобода от греха, а мирът на света е свобода на греха...”
― Схиархимандрит Касиан, Духовната криза

“I prayed to what all things hold in common. I prayed to what makes life. I thought about the elements of the universe, the rocks, the stars, the air, other living things. I tried to get the perspective of what's behind all that. I prayed to the force that brings things into existence. I thought this force encompassed all it created. My God was transcendent, and my God was also immanent. God ran in my veins. God lived and died and lived again in every atom of the universe.”
― Margaret McGee

“Science is getting knocked on all sides these days, not only from religious fundamentalists, but from all kinds of people who perceive science as arrogant, one-sided, and the source of the troubles that come with the technology it produces. It's true that individuL scientists can be so arrogant and narrowly focused, they're blind to any but their own truths, and that new discoveries bring new problems with them. Still, I don't know many people who would refuse a biopsy for a newly discovered lump because they think science needs to be taken down a peg or two.

Religion gets knocked for the same kinds of reasons as science: for its arrogance, narowmindedness, and tendency to create more trouble than it's worth. Religion is also accused of concealing reality under a comforting blanket of measureless faith -- the flip side, perhaps of the scientist for whom nothing can be real until she has measured it.

My own sojourn into religion convinced me that good religion reveals rather than conceals. Religion is the soul in search of itself and its relationship to the cosmos. This journey requires looking at all of it: the joy, the sorrow, the beauty and the horror of life. We hope for the best. We want meaning and love to exist not only in ourselves, but in the very soul of the universe. At times this great hope might tempt us to pick and choose only the data that supports our desires. But in religion as in boat-building, the design must be tested in all conditions. When I say that I'm trying to pay attention, and that paying attention means being willing to look at all of it, I think I'm trying for the same moment of clarity that Graham experienced when the wind blew all over his theory. Looking at all of it is what good science is about. I believe that it's also what good religion is about.”

“In my return to church, I had learned the hard way to avoid assumptions about other people's faith. For one thing, people kept surprising me. If I listened carefully to them, my conjectures about what they thought usually turned out to be wrong. For another thing, I was insecure enough about my own faith, such as it was, to resent other people telling me what they thought I believed and why they thought I believed it. So I tried to hear what my friends say about joining their loved ones after death without assuming I knew exactly what they meant.”
― Margaret McGee

“So it goes for those of us who live in a cul-de-sac, where babies are brought home from the hospital and watched over, where hearts stop and feet slip, where we wonder if there is a hidden road that leads somewhere.
We believe and we doubt. Believing and doubting share the same inevitability, but they are not equal. They cannot lay the same claim on our allegiance. They do not share the same power.
If there are places beyond the cul-de-sac, doubt cannot take us there.”
― John Ortberg

“There is a greater Christian faith than one which settles for the temporal happiness, and that is the augmentation of faith. The more faithful you become, the harder the obstacles get; but the harder the obstacles get, the tougher your spine grows; and the tougher your spine grows, the less dependent you are on man's approval. I came to know this about Christianity when valuing faith before comfort.”
― Criss Jami, Killosophy

“God is not only the God of the sufferers but the God who suffers. ... It is said of God that no one can behold his face and live. I always thought this meant that no one could see his splendor and live. A friend said perhaps it meant that no one could see his sorrow and live. Or perhaps his sorrow is splendor. ... Instead of explaining our suffering God shares it.”

“The organist was almost at the end of the anthem’s long introduction, and as the crescendo increases the cathedral began to glitter before my eyes until I felt as if every stone in the building was vibrating in anticipation of the sweeping sword of sound from the Choir.

The note exploded in our midst, and at that moment I knew our creator had touched not only me but all of us, just as Harriet had touched that sculpture with a loving hand long ago, and in that touch I sensed the indestructible fidelity, the indescribable devotion and the inexhaustible energy of the creator as he shaped his creation, bringing life out of dead matter, wresting form continually from chaos. Nothing was ever lost, Harriet had said, and nothing was ever wasted because always, when the work was finally completed, every article of the created process, seen or unseen, kept or discarded, broken or mended – EVERYTHING was justified, glorified and redeemed.”
― Susan Howatch

“Any faith that does not command the one who holds it is not a real belief; it is a pseudo belief only. And it might shock some of us profoundly if we were brought suddenly face to face with our beliefs and forced to test them in the fires of practical living.

Many of us Christians have become extremely skillful in arranging our lives so as to admit the truth
of Christianity without being embarrassed by its implications.”

“How is faith to endure, O God, when you allow all this scraping and tearing on us? You have allowed rivers of blood to flow, mountains of suffering to pile up, sobs to become humanity's song--all without lifting a finger that we could see. You have allowed bonds of love beyond number to be painfully snapped. If you have not abandoned us, explain yourself.

We strain to hear. But instead of hearing an answer we catch sight of God himself scraped and torn. Through our tears we see the tears of God.”
― Nicholas Wolterstorff, Lament for a Son

“When you're young, faith is often a matter of rules. What you should do and shouldn't do, that kind of thing. But as you get older, you realize that faith is really a matter of relationship - with God, with the people around you, with the members of your community.”
― Rhoda Janzen

“Love is hard. We try to love one another. But generally the quality and quantity of our love for one another is found wanting, because we find it difficult, if not impossible, to look beyond those things that are ugly and unlovable in those we try to love.

“In addition to the kind of critical reflection on one's previous assumptive or tacit system of values we saw Jack undertake, there must be, for Stage 4, a relocation of authority within the self. While others and their judgments will remain important to the Individuative-Reflective person, their expectations, advice and counsel will be submitted to an internal panel of experts who reserve the right to choose and who are prepared to take responsibility for their choices. I sometimes call this the emergence of the executive ego.

The two essential features of the emergence of Stage 4, then, are the critical distancing from one's previous assumptive value system and the emergence of the executive ego. . . .

We find that sometimes many persons complete half of this double movement, but do not complete the other.”
― James W. Fowler, Stages of Faith: The Psychology of Human Development

“Why God should want and need us is a mystery. But it is true: otherwise he would not have created us and life would ultimately have no meaning for us. It is good to remember that in God the is a constancy, a consistency of attitude which never changes, irrespective of what we are or how we act: he never changes in is wanting us or needing us.”

“That was one of the inherent flaws of faith. Belief without knowing. But worse yet: belief without action. It could be good in its own right. Beautiful, even, when embraced, but that had to be measured. Checked. Too many surrendered themselves to it. What they did not see was simple fact. Religion did not bring peace. It merely offered a means. It was up to man to create peace.”

“I loved my father, but I was not like him. I never needed to believe the best of people. I took them as they were: two-faced, desperate, kind - perhaps all at once. But to Pa, they were all children of god, poor troubled sheep, who only needed love and an even break. He needed the world to back up what his religion told him about people. And when it came down to a choice between reason and faith, he let go of reason.”

“The daily circumstances of life will afford us opportunities enough of glorifying God in trust, without our waiting for any extraordinary calls upon faith, our faith. Let us remember that the extraordinary circumstances of life are but few; that much of life may slip past without their occurrence; and that if we be not faithful and trusting in that which is little, we are not likely to be so in that which is great... Let our trust be reared in the humble nursery of our own daily experience, with its ever recurring little wants and trials, and sorrows; and then, when need be, it will come forth, to do such great things as are required of it.”

“Levi," Maria called. "Come back. We're not finished yet."
He paused
"What, Maria?"
"You asked me what I believe in? I believed in you."
He nodded his head sadly. "Yes, you did. And before you met me, you believed in nothing. But that's the thing with belief, Maria. It's easy to believe in something when it doesn't require anything from you. It's much harder, though, when the object of your belief requires something of you or asks for something you don't want to give. That's when real belief occurs.”

“There is a beauty in paradox when it comes to talking about things of ultimate concern. Paradox works against our tendency to stay superficial in our faith, or to rest on easy answers or categorical thinking. It breaks apart our categories by showing the inadequacy of them and by pointing to a reality larger than us, the reality of gloria, of light, of beyond-the-beyond. I like to call it paradoxology—the glory of paradox, paradox-doxology—which takes us somewhere we wouldn’t be capable of going if we thought we had everything all wrapped up, if we thought we had attained full comprehension. The commitment to embracing the paradox and resisting the impulse to categorize people (ourselves included) is one of the ways we follow Jesus into that larger mysterious reality of light and love.”

“Just as He had been doing even before the moment I consciously embarked on this journey, He revealed to me that it was all about love. It always has been—before the foundations of the earth—and it always will be—throughout eternity. The answers I was seeking were found in love, the healing I desperately needed also found in love. The love I sought and so desperately wanted to give was enabled, empowered, and actualized by His divine love. So nothing remains but for me to LOVE as an expression of my appreciation for His love for me: L-live an O-openly V-virtuous E-existence.”

“Molitveni jezik jedini je jezik u kojem nema jezičnih zabrana. Kako je već rečeno, on je obuhvatniji od jezika vjere koja je sigurna u samu sebe. U jeziku molitve može se naime reći i to da se ne može vjerovati.”
― Johann Baptist Metz, Memoria passionis: Ein provozierendes Gedächtnis in pluralistischer Gesellschaft

“There’s faith that knows itself as faith, Proyas, and there’s faith that confuses itself for knowledge. The first embraces uncertainty, acknowledges the mysteriousness of the God. It begets compassion and tolerance. Who can entirely condemn when they’re not entirely certain they’re in the right? But the second, Proyas, the second embraces certainty and only pays lip service to the God’s mystery. It begets intolerance, hatred, violence.”
― R. Scott Bakker, The Darkness That Comes Before

“faith doesn't mean that you don't have doubts... [you] still experience the same greed, resentment, lust, and anger that everyone else experienced... the lines between sinner and saved [are] more fluid; the sins of those who come to church are not so different from the sins of those who don't... You [need] to come to church precisely because you [are] of this world, not apart from it; rich, poor, sinner, saved you [need] to embrace Christ precisely because you had sins to wash away... that religious commitment did not require me to suspend critical thinking, disengage from the battle for economic and social justice, or otherwise retreat from the world...”
― Barack Obama, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream

“Faith belongs to the human spirit. Faith is faith. Humanity is divided by religion, religion is the divider of humanity. If every human could be removed of their blindfolds and see that faith is in itself faith and that this is something which belongs to each and every human being, then at that time the dividers of religion will suddenly mean nothing and we will all see that we are united by faith in and of itself. There is only one faith and it is called faith. And no man needs to prove to another man that what he believes in exists, because even if it does not exist, his faith is his belief that it is there, that something is there, and that in itself is faith. So I do not need to prove to any man that what I believe in exists or not, there is no such contest between man, my faith breathes in the body of my belief; the fact that I believe is the breath of my faith.”

“A strong, vague persuasion that it was better to go forward than backward, and that I could go forward— that a way, however narrow and difficult, would in time open— predominated over other feelings: its influence hushed them so far, that at last I became sufficiently tranquil to be able to say my prayers and seek my couch. I had just extinguished my candle and lain down, when a deep, low, mighty tone swung through the night. At first I knew it not; but it was uttered twelve times, and at the twelfth colossal hum and trembling knell, I said: “I lie in the shadow of St. Paul’s.”

“From Les Miserables:

All at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; a sound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had been horrible. It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burst of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night; women's voices, but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accent of children, -- voices which are not of the earth, and which resemble those that the newborn infant still hears, and which the dying man hears already. This song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden. At the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated, one would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom.

Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees.

They knew not what it was, they knew not where they were; but both of them, the man and the child, the penitent and the innocent, felt that they must kneel.

These voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted. It was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house.

While these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. He no longer beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky. It seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us, unfolding.

The song died away. It may have lasted a long time. Jean Valjean could not have told. Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment.”
― Victor Hugo

“I still find my corrupt heart longing for tomorrow's bread. I can make a good argument to the Lord about how effective I can be if He would supply me with enough advance funds. It's a little frightening to pray for TODAY's bread. That means I must pray again for tomorrow and believe again for tomorrow. My greedy heart is willing to be corrupted by a little bit of riches so that I see my warehouse full of loaves. I can make a good argument about how God won’t have to be bothered with me every day if He would only advance me about ten years worth of bread.”

“In that moment, I understand the way that the noblest yearning for duty and sacrifice can be mixed up with all that is savage and shameful, like in the Bible, where a just and merciful God tells you to kill everyone, kill the children, kill the livestock, kill John Polling, leave nothing alive to sully this pure and just world. Except when it's all done you find out that wasn't really God after all, just some politician, or maybe it was God, but he taps you on the shoulder and says, 'No, dude, that isn't what I meant,' and leaves you sitting in a Dairy Queen in Bothell with blood on your hands and no further orders...”

“Manifest in this trade (commercial sale of indulgences via bankers) at the same time was a pernicious tendency in the Roman Catholic system, for the trade in indulgences was not an excess or an abuse but the direct consequence of the nomistic degradation of the gospel. That the Reformation started with Luther’s protest against this traffic in indulgences proves its religious origin and evangelical character. At issue here was nothing less than the essential character of the gospel, the core of Christianity, the nature of true piety. And Luther was the man who, guided by experience in the life of his own soul, again made people understand the original and true meaning of the gospel of Christ. Like the “righteousness of God,” so the term “penitence” had been for him one of the most bitter words of Holy Scripture. But when from Romans 1:17 he learned to know a “righteousness by faith,” he also learned “the true manner of penitence.” He then understood that the repentance demanded in Matthew 4:17 had nothing to do with the works of satisfaction required in the Roman institution of confession, but consisted in “a change of mind in true interior contrition” and with all its benefits was itself a fruit of grace. In the first seven of his ninety-five theses and further in his sermon on “Indulgences and Grace” (February 1518), the sermon on “Penitence” (March 1518), and the sermon on the “Sacrament of Penance” (1519), he set forth this meaning of repentance or conversion and developed the glorious thought that the most important part of penitence consists not in private confession (which cannot be found in Scripture) nor in satisfaction (for God forgives sins freely) but in true sorrow over sin, in a solemn resolve to bear the cross of Christ, in a new life, and in the word of absolution, that is, the word of the grace of God in Christ. The penitent arrives at forgiveness of sins, not by making amends (satisfaction) and priestly absolution, but by trusting the word of God, by believing in God’s grace. It is not the sacrament but faith that justifies. In that way Luther came to again put sin and grace in the center of the Christian doctrine of salvation. The forgiveness of sins, that is, justification, does not depend on repentance, which always remains incomplete, but rests in God’s promise and becomes ours by faith alone.”
― Herman Bavinck

“The cure for our modern maladies is dirt under the fingernails and the feel of thick grass between the toes. The cure for our listlessness is to be out within the invigorating wind.

“What about you, Snipes?" Dunbar asked. "You think there to be mountain lions up here or is it just folks' imaginings?"

Snipes pondered the question a few moments before speaking.

They's many a man of science would claim there aint because you got no irredeemable evidence like panther scat or fur or tooth or tail. In other words, some part of the animal in questions. Or better yet having the actual critter itself, the whole think kit and caboodle head to tail, which all your men of science argue is the best proof of all a thing exists, whether it be a panther, or a bird, or even a dinosaur."

To put it another way, if you was to stub your toe and tell the man of science what happened he'd not believe a word of it less he could see how it'd stoved up or was bleeding. But your philosophers and theologians and such say there’s things in the world that’s every bit as real even though you can’t see them.”

Like what?” Dunbar asked.

Well,” Snipes said. “They’s love, that’s one. And courage. You can’t see neither of them, but they’re real. And air, of course. That’s one of your most important examples. You wouldn’t be alive a minute if there wasn’t air, but nobody’s ever seen a single speck of it.”

… “All I’m saying is there is a lot more to this old world than meets the eye.”

… “And darkness. You can’t see it no more than you can see air, but when its all around you sure enough know it.” (Serena, 65-66)”

“The South African artist William Kentridge speaks to this type of certainty: 'To say that one needs art, or politics, that incorporate ambiguity and contradiction is not to say that one then stops recognizing and condemning things as evil. However, it might stop one being so utterly convinced of the certainty of one's own solutions. There needs to be a strong understanding of fallibility and how the very act of certainty or authoritativeness can bring disasters.'

The outcome of the current crisis is already determined.”

Once in a while, I like to speak to you, yes to you, that which peeps through a twinkle or a tear, that which hears the vision and sees the hymn of the stars, that which resides in the deepest niche of our heart, that which shines through our mind, that which is beyond consciousness yet shaping it with the fine chords of human life. I like to congratulate you, for being there, fuelling that body which often gets tired of walking a long path, through a forest of fire. I like to caress you, for binding that mind and heart that often finds itself in a pit of gusty turbulence, sometimes losing sometimes winning that camouflaged victory of this ocean of illusion. I like to look at you through that eye of prideful faith that which leads one to jump off a cliff only to open those wings of love and light. I like to hear you, from the numb screams marring the dungeons of reality to the polished words that cross your lips each time this world shows up on your doorstep. I like to feel you, with all your vulnerabilities for they are the reason you are here in this voyage of earthly life. I like to speak to you, to every soul, for each of you have a story, a special story that is written by Him, a painting, a special painting that is coloured by Him, for you dear soul, is a flicker of love and light, of Him.
So to every soul, you are special.”

“Here we have a penetrating insight. Our twentieth century society with its new morality, psychological explanations, and relativistic standards is actually no more free from guilt than earlier generations. We have simply adopted a kind of cultural defense against guilt, renamed it, and proclaimed our freedom. We now talk about inferiority, self-esteem, and depression. But all these things are indications of hidden guilt. The only difference is that large numbers of people are now experiencing the subjective elements of guilt without realizing it. Having disguised and renamed the problem, however, we may now be even further from the real solution.”

I have now come to believe that not only are guilt feels destructive, they are diametrically opposed to a scriptural view of motivation and actually reflect our own independent efforts to solve the problem of sin in our lives.

“As the New Adam, Jesus confronts the curses laid on Adam that have plagued the human family ever since the Fall. Like Adam, Jesus, on the night before He died, enters a garden-the Garden of Gethsemane-where He is tested (Mt 26:36-46). There, He takes on Adam's sweat as He experiences sweat-like drops of blood falling from His face. On Good Friday, Jesus symbolically takes on the curse of Adam's thorns as He is handed over to the Roman soldiers, who place a crown of thorns on His head (Mt 27:29). Finally, Jesus even takes on the curse of Adam's death as He goes to a tree-the wood of the cross-and dies on Calvary. And, like Adam, Jesus is placed in the cursed ground, where He is buried in a tomb. It is precisely from the darkness of that tomb in the cursed ground that Jesus, the Light of the World, rises victoriously from the dead on Easter Sunday to shine the light of salvation at the dawn of the new creation.”

“The problem of the church is not lack of prayer. The problem of the church is lack of action. So many Christians are on prayer mountains at the beginning of the every year (and that's wonderful) but few actually lifts a finger towards doing what they are praying for.

Too many Christians have used this phrase "I'm waiting on God" to escape their life's purpose and work in general. Some do nothing but wait on God from January to December. But God doesn't work with waiters. God works with doers, movers and shakers.”
― Nicky Verd

“Ceremony has become fraught with judgment: the idea that whoever our God might be, He requires absolute adherence to the way, to the means, of approach. But those reactions are based on fear, and they're inaccurate.

The elders say that Creator is perfect loving energy. Within the realm of perfect love there is no judgment. If there is no judgment then there can be no failure. In turn, if failure does not exist, there is no unworthiness. We are all one energy. We are worthy and we always were. We never have to qualify. And ceremony was born to allow us to remember that.”

“To be sure, there is no method, no single way, to anchor in Faith and employ Patience. Letting go, trusting the process of Life and living with Faith and Patience, is the way. Living through our crippling bankruptcy for over 12 years now, Vaani and I have realized that Faith does not always solve our problems immediately. But having Faith in the process of Life – that what goes around, comes around; that what goes up will come down some day, only to go back up another day – certainly helps us to cope with our problems better. Keeping the Faith also teaches us Patience. Unless you embrace these twin philosophies, and live practising them together, you will not see the miracles in your everyday Life.”

“It insists on our absolute belief in unverifiable creeds and, in return, promises a reward that can only be verified after we cease to exist. By demanding the unconditional renunciation of our reason in this way, bad-faith prevents us from living an authentic, intentional life: it anaesthetises our integrity.”

“My love is present wherever life takes you,
Whoever you are with and whatever you are doing.
Just close your eyes and think of me and I will be there.
Life has its plans that we mostly know nothing about,
It takes away some people and brings to us others.
Sometimes we can't be where we would like to be, where our heart is yearning to be, with the ones we love so, so much,
We may call it destiny, fate, kismet.
Whatever it is, we must try to accept that it's part of a greater plan,
And someday when we least expect it,
God will send us the answers.”

“Faithful people suffer and evil people prosper all the time [...]. Besides, if our actions are driven only by reward or punishment--eternal or otherwise--then they are motivated by greed and selfishness, not faith or love. That is where so many people go wrong, even those who say they believe [...]. They obey because they think it will make their *lives* better, rather than *themselves*. And that is very much the wrong reason.”

“There are some ten thousand extant religious sects--each with its own cosmology, each with its own answer for the meaning of life and death. Most assert that the other 9,999 not only have it completely wrong but are instruments of evil, besides. None of the ten thousand has yet persuaded me to make the requisite leap of faith. In the absence of conviction, I've come to terms with the fact that uncertainty is an inescapable corollary of life. An abundance of mystery is simply part of the bargain--which doesn't strike me as something to lament. Accepting the essential inscrutability of existence, in any case, is surely preferable to its opposite: capitulating to the tyranny of intransigent belief.”
― Jon Krakauer, Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith

“They say that believing in God can be hard. But from where I’m standing, that’s nothing compared to having to believe in myself. Yet, the oddest thing of all is that God believes in me even if I don’t believe in either of us.”

“Why should I believe you, a common-born woman, over the son of a margrave?"
Hathui smiled wryly. "God makes the sun to rise on noblewoman and commoner alike. The Lord and Lady love us all equally in Their hearts, my lady."
"Yet Our Lord and Lady follow Their own will in parceling out to individuals whatever They wish. To some They give more, and to others, less. Could we not also argue that we merit what we each receive? That They confer on the elect these gifts of grace that set them apart from others?"
But the Eagle shrugged, her expression untroubled. "All gifts are given to us by God. Without such gifts, no matter how noble, we are dust. So we are all equal before God - and the honorable word of a common-born woman no different than that of a nobly born man.”
― Kate Elliott, Prince of Dogs

“Trusting yourself is the opposite of trusting God. If you trust God totally (as you must) you must mistrust yourself. If you trust yourself, you are automatically mistrusting God.
Faith is not enough, you also need an act of will. The act of will you need is precisely deciding to trust God fully and mistrust yourself.
Modern psychology has lost its bearings when they insist that one must trust oneself. That position is un-Christian.”
― Manuel Alfonseca

“We won't ever experience the rewards of belief without the risk of belief. Acting on our belief in God in the present moment is risky. It requires courage and faith. But when we do it, we have a story to tell that echoes God's greater story - the story of a God who rescues, redeems, helps, heals, and restores those who place their faith in him. It's not enough for you and me to talk about belief, write about belief, or plan to act on our belief someday. We must grab opportunities when we see them, surrendering our fear to his certain providence and love.”

“I asked for strength that I might achieve;
I was made weak that I might learn humbly to obey.

I asked for health that I might do greater things;
I was given infirmity that I might do better things.

I asked for riches that I might be happy;
I was given poverty that I might be wise.

I asked for power that I might have the praise of men;
I was given weakness that I might feel the need of God.

I asked for all things that I might enjoy life;
I was given life that I might enjoy all things.

I got nothing that I asked for
but everything that I had hoped for.
Almost despite myself my unspoken prayers were answered,
I am, among all men, most richly blessed”

“How do you last a torrid time in Life?
1. Accept the reality that you are in the throes of a crisis. Stop wishing that it didn’t exist. Acceptance always delivers inner peace.
2. Know that the storm will always be strong. By even thinking of its ferocity, you are only going to feel debilitated. At the epicenter of a storm, it is always calm. Find that center, your center. That’s where you will find strength.
3. Your center is where you lose sense of time, place and thought. Art – anything inherent that makes you come alive – often leads you there.
4. Trust the process of Life. Do what you can do without losing your inner peace – daily, diligently.
5. No matter how intense it is, no storm lasts forever. All storms pass. So, be patient, surrender completely, let go…and offer yourself to be led by Life…”

“For many people, apologetics is one of the biggest things that God has used to strengthen their faith and help them grow in their relationship with Him. Learning about the various ways that science, history, and philosophy cohere with God and how apparent conflicts can be resolved is exciting and edifying. Like Jacob struggling with God and refusing to let go until God blessed him, apologetics allows us to struggle with God over the deep philosophical and theological questions of our time. There’s a blessing for us in that struggle!”

“Life’s very nature is that it is fraught with uncertainty in every moment. Anything, absolutely anything, can happen at any time. Simply, Life hai, kuch bhi ho sakta hai! So, learn to trust the process of Life. This act of trusting the process of Life is what Faith is all about. When you have Faith, Fear cannot debilitate you. Now, Faith and Fear cannot co-exist. So, if you are feeling fearful, it clearly means you lack the Faith! Re-examine how you are approaching your Life. Are you anchored in Faith or are you cowering in Fear? Intelligent living means embracing the uncertainty with Faith and going with the flow; it means knowing that wherever Life takes you is where you were always meant to arrive!”
― AVIS Viswanathan

“Faith must always thrive in the absence of any physical evidence. Let’s say you are negotiating a dark tunnel with a torch in your hand. As long as the torch is lit and you can see, you imagine you are in control, that you will soon figure your way out. But what if the battery drains and the torch dies? And it is pitch dark, scary; you are clueless and don’t know what to do? Faith, then, is your only resort. If you deploy your Faith – in the absence of even a shred of evidence that you will survive – and believe that you will come out of the tunnel unscathed, you surely will! That is why Faith is not just a coping mechanism, it is a game-changer! Harness the power of your Faith, understand the futility of fear, and see doors open miraculously where there once stood impregnable walls!”
― AVIS Viswanathan

“We want the schedule for the next five years. But God says, "Take my hand. Let's just focus on doing the next right thing.”

“Dear me,
I am happy the way you have turned out. I am happy the way you have closed in all the broken parts of your self and made them look like waves cutting across the edges of a shore that seems so distant yet alive. I am happy the way you screamed at every gust and almost fell back with choked tears and yet walked on while your mind told you otherwise. I am happy the way you caressed the numb tears of your heart and poured it out unashamedly for they made you so much more than just a piece of Earth. I am happy the way you believed in Love even when your love left you empty with scars and wounds that are yet unhealed. I am happy the way you left your wounds untouched for you knew the value of Life and the reason to walk on this pit of fire. I am happy the way you learnt to sprinkle rays from your ashes and yet remain unabsorbed in the chained hollows of your once broken soul. I am happy the way you tried to listen to your heart's cry for that led you to a paradise of a world lulled by His Mercy and Love. I am happy the way you chose to rise from your corpse and know that Life means love and light not only for your self but for everyone around. I am happy that you finally realized that your life is complete within itself and you are perfect beyond all your imperfections. I am happy that you found your calling in the horizon of smiles that you leave behind each time you cross path with a fellow Traveller of this voyage called Life. I am happy that in your solitude you found the company of your best friend that lies within. I am happy that even in the night you shine bright with the sun of your soul that knows no bound and trusts no fear. I am happy that you keep trying and pushing off all that puts you behind and never cease to wonder at the marvel of Life. I am happy that you never stopped to gaze at what you lost but stayed amazed at what you gained. I am happy that you keep stumbling through Life, waiting for the light that runs through an endless tunnel of hope, counting through the ever falling leaf of a grey rose that murmurs through an unending story of Hope and Faith. I am happy that you are all that you have become. And I am happy the way you have turned out.
- A flicker, that lies inside of you.”

“It surely will help if children understand Life’s simple, unalterable truths early on:
1. What goes up, comes down and will go back up again; also, what goes around, comes around!
2. Until we get what we want, we must be patient.
3. Life happens through us and not because of us.
4. This human form, this lifetime, is a gift that we must be eternally grateful for.
So, even if we can’t teach them or give them anything else, let us imbue in our children an appreciation for Life through these four perspectives – Faith, Patience, Humility and Gratitude. This is how we can prepare them for going through Life with equanimity, happily, despite whatever circumstances they have to deal with!”

“Nevertheless, we should take the worries about reducing theology to philosophy seriously. So what we need is a philosophical approach to Divine revelation that steers clear of two oposing forms of reductionism that we have encountered so far: On the one hand, a philosophical rationalism that aims at reducing articles of faith to philosophical principles, on the other hand, a theological fideism that takes itself to be free of the restrictions of rationality and reason, and despises rational analysis in matters of faith.”

“Now, we turn to the gods – not for guidance or protection, but as experimental subjects. Deities, demons and other supernatural entities can be considered as self-perpetuating structures in the elemental chaos. They might be naturally accreting structures, or perhaps they were unconsciously shaped over many generations by blind faith. These self-perpetuating structures can channel elemental energy through congruent souls – or, to put it another way, saints manifest the sacred blessings of the gods.”

“Their creeds, however, were in many respects opposite. Where one discovered only confirmations of his faith, the other could find nothing but reasons for doubt. Moral necessity, and calvinistic inspiration, were the props on which my brother thought proper to repose.

“A boy is in search of faith. Such a faith that he went to the forest for it, although it is not always preferable. The God with his entire presence is everywhere, but this boy, he loved the forest. He always thought that the forest is better than the city; free from artificially fabricated environment, free from social animals and full of real animals, whose intentions are very clear, far clearer than the social animals. When they search for prey, they use claws and teeth and jaws and roars, they don’t use soft words, fake emotions and false love.”
― Sameem ul Islam, The Real Happiness

“The weird thing about the bible is that almost everything in it is a metaphor.

So it seems to me that when the bible describes church as a place where two or more people discuss God, they don’t mean just the cathedral like churches. I don’t know what, who or where God is; but if everything is a metaphor, I think he or she is a comparison to us. I think we are like, or as God. I think when we get together, and talk about ourselves, about being human, about what hurts us; we are also talking about God.

So that’s also church, right?

I know this might seem blasphemous, but my priest tells me its okay to ask questions, even if they seem bizarre.”
― Elizabeth Acevedo, The Poet X

“In order to live a fulfilling life, you must do as much (if not more) for yourself as you do for others. Sometimes we spend so much time caring for the next person we neglect to invest in ourselves. Remind yourself every day: Your needs, your aspirations, your success, and your goals also matter. It’s ok to be a shoulder, cheerleader, friend and support system; but remember, you deserve as good as you give.”

“I hadn’t thought of—let alone said—“Soul Leading” in many years, and stumbled awkwardly through the words. Ian spoke it without hesitation, though, and I wondered how often he had used it through those years.

The words seemed puny and powerless, swallowed among the sounds of hay rustling and beasts chewing. But I felt a tiny bit of comfort for having said them. Perhaps it was only that the sense of reaching out to something larger than yourself gives you some feeling that there is something larger—and there really has to be, because plainly you aren’t sufficient to the situation. I surely wasn’t.”

“Faith is not in itself a meritorious act; the merit is in the One toward Whom it is directed. Faith is a redirecting of our sight, a getting out of the focus of our own vision and getting God into focus. Sin has twisted our vision inward and made it self-regarding. Unbelief has put self where God should be, and is perilously close to the sin of Lucifer who said, "I will set my throne above the throne of God." Faith looks out instead of in and the whole life falls into line.”

“Yes, I love the church, but not because it has formed a snug cocoon around me, insulating me from the world. Just the opposite is true. It's where I've encountered my fears.

You are giving your old and new creation a beautiful place to live, bountiful food to eat, a grand fellowship and a Father who loves them. They have every opportunity in the world to respond to you and be close to you. If they don't see that, I don't know how else you can show them!”

“The most sacred truths of the faith are given full material reality, leading up to that moment when Christ himself becomes present at the altar. This was marked by the moment of elevation when the priest held up the host, become by a miracle the body of Jesus. At that instant candles and torches, made up of bundles of wood, were lit to illuminate the scene; the sacring bell was rung, and the church bells pealed so that those in the neighbouring streets or fields might be aware of the solemn moment. It was the sound which measured the hours of their day. Christ was present in their midst once more and, as a the priest lifted up the thin wafer of bread, time and eternity were reconciled.”

“Now if we are always falling back on these 'if-it-be-Thy-will prayers' we are debasing this most well known prayer promise of the apostle John, and making it a prayer 'let-out', a useful carpet under which we can sweep all our unanswered prayers. We imply that what he is really saying is this: 'And this is the lack of confidence which we have in Him, that unless we happen to ask according to His will, He will not hear us, and we shall not have our petition.' So the promise that was intended to confirm our faith serves only to cover our unbelief and to confirm us in our state of weakness, in seeking to prevail with God.”

And until you see Life’s magic and beauty, until you realize that it is what it is, be Patient with the process of Life.

While I can't fully reconcile the problem of evil and why so many people have been sexually violated over the centuries, I do know this: Jesus has wept alongside me, and he weeps for his church to rise up valiantly and love the least, the last, and the lost.

“On Hijacking of Judaism: My sad story of shock and awe, Began three thousands years ago, When calf worship was high and low, As Ben Nebat, the King of Israel, Took off hijacking Judaism, Which is still hijacked by Zionism, But who in his right mind: Could have ever been imagined? That Ben Nebat's dreadful mission, Was the beginning of a long tradition, Of brutal hijackers with ambition, One hijacker following another; Kingdoms competing with each other, Till they left the promised land, To a never-never land, Where Exodus is open-ended, And the true Torah is suspended, As the Sinai Ark of the Covenant, Has for long been apprehended, And the only true word of God, With no clue, or alibi. Is nowhere to be found; Like a pie in the sky”

“And on the Second Hijacking of Christianity: But most sinister of Brethren Kings, Was Roman Emperor Constantine, Forcing the invention of a Trinity God, By inviting the Council of the Nicene, While he kept an undivided, Dearest and nearest Roman Empire, What else a monarch, so cunning, Could have had for his ultimate desire, Then he decreed that the Trinity God, Shall be Master of the Roman Empire, But the irony came on his death bed, Seeking a priest for a final prayer. The Emperor died Unitarian instead, For it was Eusebius who baptized, Constantine as a dying Emperor, A non- Trinitarian was thus empowered, And entrusted with the high honor. Of an Emperor departing a miserable world, In widespread quandary and strife, With never ending schism and confusion, Adding serious threat to life. With hundreds of heretics burned to stakes, Others beheaded by an ax or a knife, And while limiting religious freedoms. This Trinity God is in fact polytheism, A Doctrine considered by Jews and Moslems, To be "Shirk": just a form of paganism.”

“And on Hijacking of Contemporary Islam, And the last of Brethren Kings. Is King Fahd of the Saudi Arabs, Who pretends to be fighting terrorism. With abundant petro-dollars. Allied with vicious imperialism. Oppressing freedoms and scholars. A most subtle mask indeed. As the mighty rich Saudis, Plagued with tribal family greed, Are hijackers of Islam, In fact audacious King Fahd, Recently declared a real sham, As he went on attacking Islam, Using terms of monarchial deceit, Calling it a government by the elite, Devoid of Western-style Democracy, What ignorance, what hypocrisy! A self-serving declaration, For a dictatorial theocracy, So now the Saudis are carving out. Their "Hypocritical Protocol," Bringing down their entire nation. Under Saudis' solid control, With their polygamist breeding wives. Delivering thousands of Saudi lives, As a one-famliy-government body. Of corrupt men with dozens of wives, No longer armed with daggers and knives, Thanks to their loyal imperial powers, Their arms are missiles and radar towers, Whence their grip on political power, While thoughts of democracy and freedom leave them ill- tempered and even sour.”
― Sami El-Soudani

“And finally On All Hijackings of Religion. That was my sad story, Of three brethren kings, Hijackers of the mind, Who obviously need no wings, Exploiters of religion, Three monarchs with ambition. But for now my all-time brothers, And sisters reading my sad story, These hijackers have had their druthers, And some even celebrated their glory; But don't ye grieve or be uptight. So long as we all this time get it right; We must reach out and pull one another, So we all can make it through a very long night, Rising above the abyss of dirt and mud, Remembering that with every daybreak, There is a new beginning with God.”

“I do not doubt the ability of mankind to aspire to lofty ideals and the most pristine of principles. But what I doubt is the willingness of mankind to incur the sacrifices involved in moving from aspiring these things to actually embracing them. And in such a conundrum as this, I would suggest that to stop at ‘aspiring’ and never move to ‘embracing’ is without a doubt the greatest sacrifice of all.”

“Do not tell me about your principles, for words are easy to craft and talk is cheap. Rather, let me see you live them out in the sentence and syntax of everyday life.

Rather, I want to know that you understand the sacrifice of living them out, and that the weight of the principle offsets the sacrifice of carrying it.”

“Hear me beautiful woman, The Voice from within. Greater is He that is within you than he that is within the world. You cannot begin to understand when one looks at you with eyes of the world and only sees what is optically visible. It takes time for one to know you and what's inside. Only One knows you from within, from the beginning. The world may hurt you because of its outward mindset but know that your beauty is deep. Know that you are loved by the one who sees the real you. Know that you are understood by the one who knows your mind and your heart. Know that you are a virtuous because of your resilience through love, and not defeated. Oh beautiful woman stand strong and confident in the one who reaffirms Who You Are and not how Broken You Are. Your power is strengthened with every Act of forgiveness that you practice. Your beauty is increased with every act of kindness that you show to that ugly head a worldly perception with hopes that it will recognize "you". Stop quirreling with the enemy in your mind that turns your hampster wheel. It drains your hope by showing you pictures passed instead of vision unrevealed. You are who HE says you are despite anyone who doesn't marvel in adoration. Don't see youself as the world reflects you; the world's mirror is tainted. Optical illusions can be fatal. Wake up! The eyes tell the mind what to see but only the heart can discern what lies beneath the scars, beyond the perseverance, inside of forgiveness, over the hills and valleys, signs on the journey, and hope for the spirit. Emotions are vissitudal. You are being etched in inexorable truth. Stand as your are, not as you're seen.
Sincerely,
Vitrue”

“Throughout this project I have been filled with grace in many ways. Indeed, I can feel God’s Providential hand at work in my life, often quite powerfully. And I have been the beneficiary of what I can only describe as miracles. Some pertain to this work. I would like to share a few of them with you because from the start I felt I was drawn to engage in this project through the call of the Holy Spirit and these events only confirm that this project was blessed from the start. I share with you not to boast, but so you may see that God often actually works powerfully in one’s life, even in seemingly little things, for it is always to His greater glory. This is why we should share such stories with each other. For if we choose to retain secretly what He has given us, it does not work for His greater glory, but for our own destruction.”

“We will discover, to our surprise, that we are all mentally ill. Our worst mental illness is not insanity.

Unbelief is a kind of mental atrophy, an inability to see anything beyond and above our own minds.”

Energy is a funny thing. It can be used, stored or even abused. The energy that we put into life, and I don't mean running around, but through prayer and positive thoughts.

The universe is here for a reason and you have to find out what that reason is.”
― Anthony T. Hincks

“The Christian disciple today has access to a world wide web of materials. There is plenty out there for a curious new Christian to discover. Even the maturing disciple can find groups, Bible studies, and prayer materials to help them grow for the mission of Christ.

The Church is just now beginning to understand that there is much work to do if we are to engage in mission that is not limited to one worldly abode alone.”

“But since the adversary does not cease to resist many, and uses many and diverse arts to ensnare them, that he may seduce the faithful from their faith, and that he may prevent the faithless from believing, it seems to me necessary that we also, being armed with the invulnerable doctrines of the faith, do battle against him in behalf of the weak.”

This book is not about a call for conversion or coercion into any type of religious persuasion.

“When the song was ended, he struck the rail he leaned upon a sharp blow with his open hand. There swept over him a feeling that he had stood precisely where he stood now, on such a night, a thousand years ago, had heard that voice and that song, had listened and been moved by the song, and the night, just as he was moved now.

He had long known himself for a sentimentalist; he had almost given up trying to cure himself. And he knew himself for a born lover; he had always been in love with some one. In his earlier youth his affections had been so constantly inconstant that he finally came to settle with his self-respect by recognizing in himself a fine constancy that worshipped one woman always — it was only the shifting image of her that changed! Somewhere (he dreamed, whimsically indulgent of the fancy; yet mocking himself for it) there was a girl whom he had never seen, who waited till he should come. She was Everything. Until he found her, he could not help adoring others who possessed little pieces and suggestions of her — her brilliancy, her courage, her short upper lip, “like a curled roseleaf,” or her dear voice, or her pure profile. He had no recollection of any lady who had quite her eyes.”

whatever you desire
with each forthcoming day.

May I lose myself to find you,

my love, my core, my laughter,
permeate my every deed.”

“I wonder, sometimes, if the Continentals were like shoals of fish, & the slightest flick of one fish caused dozens of others to follow suit, until the entire shimmering cloud had changed course.

And were the Divinities the sum of this cloud? An embodiment, perhaps, of a national subconscious? Or were they empowered by the thoughts & praises of millions of people, yet also yoked to every one of those thoughts – giant, terrible puppets forced to dance by the strings of millions of puppeteers.

This knowledge, I think, is incredibly dangerous. The Continentals derive so much pride & so much power from having Divine approval … but were they merely hearing the echoes of their own voices, magnified through strange caverns & tunnels? When they spoke to the Divinities, were they speaking to giant reflections of themselves?”

“I will become discouraged and often I deeply lament of the fallenness that presses down in ever-darkening swells all around me. But I have learned that to be discouraged in the face of sin running rampant is simply my humanity finding itself vexed to exhaustion as I grapple with the wonder of ‘what could be’ as held against the depravity of ‘what is.’ Yet what I’ve learned is that discouragement is fortitude in the making, for God knows that to seize the vision of how good things can be we must first experience the wretchedness of how bad they can become. Only then will we understand the gravity of our mission and the power of goodness to achieve it.”

Many a watcher there has said: 'While I view Thee, wounded, grieving, Breathless on the cursed tree, Lord, I feel my heart believing That Thou suffer'dst thus for me.”
― Charles Haddon Spurgeon, All of Grace

“Sensuality is knowing deep down within yourself that you’re going to be okay no matter what happens. It’s having faith that you’re fundamentally worthy whether you get what you want or don’t.”

“Love is directly proportional to faith, the higher the faith the higher the love.”

“The historians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had one great advantage; they felt themselves as citizens of the world. They were never strangers to their subject matter, and knew nothing of that shyness which the stranger always feels. They felt themselves at home throughout the inhabited world, at any rate, so long as they remained in their own country, or the lands immediately adjacent, in a bodily sense, and made all further journeyings in the spirit alone. They did not sit fumbling over their material, but went straight to the persons concerned, whether men of the immediate past or those of earliest ages; whether Romans or Greeks, French, English, Hindus, Chinese or Indians. The historian stepped forward without formality and took his hero cordially by the hand, spoke to him as friend to friend, or let us say, as one man of the world to another. There was never any fear, in those days, that differences of language, or of circumstances in a different age, might place obstacles in the way of a proper understanding. Men were inspired with faith in a common humanity, and by the certainty that if once the human element could be grasped, all the rest would work out of itself. All mankind were agreed as to what God was, what good and evil were; all were agreed in patriotism and citizenship, in love of parents and of children — in a word, agreed in all realities.”

“We believe that the sun is in the sky at midday in summer not because we can clearly see the sun (in fact, we cannot) but because we can see everything else.”

“What is it about us that we take such inspiration from the lives of those who triumph over tragedy? Is it as simple as that we love a story with a happy ending, or does it go deeper than that? Could it be because we never really know if, within ourselves, we have the strength to bear such tragedy and survive such intense grief? Or is it that we too actually do know pain—and along with more than a few tears—we know from experience, that after the pain, there does again come a time for joy, because we have our own story. And could it be that for everything we’ve been through, that no one really knows us—especially, if we keep it all a secret.”
― Tonya L. Matthews

“Granted that good works are to be done, are they a cause, or "input", which helps bring about justification? Or are they a symptom, result , or "output" from a justification already received and possessed through faith?”

“Confucius believed that through self-cultivation, one can mold one's character because it is plastic and malleable. Virtue does not come from one's natural ability or innate capacity, but from one's single-minded effort and disciplined practice. Work is therefore not an expression of an individual's own passions and values, but of one's persistent dedication to loving one's family and community.”
― Russell Jeung, At Home In Exile: Finding Jesus among My Ancestors and Refugee Neighbors

“Never wish to be a want.”
― Lailah Gifty Akita

“Unlike Americans, who value egalitarian relationships, the Chinese recognize the hierarchical nature of relationships that have uneven power dynamics. Since it is easy for those with power to become paternalistic or patronizing when they serve others, we must learn Christ's humility and self-emptying. As we fill our different roles, we need to fulfill our responsibilities with love and a humbleness to serve. This Chinese understanding of humility serves as a helpful counterbalance to American approaches to urban ministry and development. As guests in any community, we need to approach our neighbors empty of expectations and plans. Instead, we must become reliant on the people of peace whom God sends out. When doing ministry, our joy and strength cannot be based on our own success or power. We receive these gifts only when being guests of the King and recognizing our limitations while in exile.”
― Russell Jeung, At Home In Exile: Finding Jesus among My Ancestors and Refugee Neighbors

“Only the blood of the blameless Lamb, the LORD JESUS CHRIST, can wash the stain of sin to be made as clean as cotton.”

“One of the greatest plagues that besets our humanity is our inability to believe in the totality of who we are and the utter vastness of what we can achieve.

“The greatest sacrifice is to unreservedly give the whole of oneself to another, knowing full well that such a gift must be wholly rejected, blithely tossed aside and trampled underfoot as some worthless filth because (much like ourselves) the depravity of the recipient is such that they can only be saved through the death of the giver. And I don’t know of any human who would do that, but I know a God Who did.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“Only Christ Jesus can clean your heart.”
― Lailah Gifty Akita

“Seeing their parents' struggles, Asian American children tend to feel very obligated and motivated to live up to their parents' expectations. I think that's also why Asian American second-generation Christians can be so fervent in their faith. They understand God's sacrifice in deep, personal ways because they have family models of this self-giving.”

“There are many religious people who believe if they act or believe in accordance with God’s will, God should and will protect them from calamities such as bad health and early death. Many pious people have been afflicted with disease and many non-religious and evil people have lived long and healthy lives. It should be obvious to anyone there is simply no correlation between religiosity and being protected from illness. (There are measurable health benefits to leading the purposeful, family-centered, and community-centered life healthy religious practices provide, but that is another matter.) How could there be such a correlation? As Harold Kushner has observed, does the belief God protects the righteous mean a good religious person can go out in freezing weather without a coat and never get sick?
If God really did protect religious people from all illness, why would any rational person not be religious? Moreover, faith would no longer be faith. It wouldn’t take any faith to believe in God and to lead a religious life. It would be a completely empirically based decision: Observe x and you will never get cancer; believe y and you will never get heart disease. That’s not faith, it’s a health care decision.
The belief God protects those with proper observance or faith from all disease must ultimately lead to an unsympathetic, even judgmental, response to people who get sick: ‘If only they were more observant [or] if only they had a deeper faith—they wouldn’t have gotten cancer or had that heart attack.’ The victim of cancer or a heart attack is then doubly victimized.”
― Dennis Prager, The Rational Bible: Exodus

“A faith based on miracles will quickly fade, dependent on the next miracle. Such an attitude cannot even be called faith.”
― Dennis Prager, The Rational Bible: Exodus

“Although I’m a bit tentative about it all, I would like to say that if my death saved your life I would gladly engage in such an exchange. But if I must make that exchange knowing that you are likely to reject it, and that you will turn on it and brutally ridicule it until the beauty of my sacrifice is altogether destroyed, I cannot imagine taking such an action. Yet, God does that every single day.”

“Humility cannot exist without love, and love cannot exist without humility. It is impossible for these virtues to exist except where there is great detachment from all created things.”
― Teresa of Ávila, The Way of Perfection

“Life is a helluva journey. You face situations. You meet people. You try to understand situations. You try to understand people.
But you will never ever be able to understand people. You will never ever be able to understand why some things happen.

You feel you desperately need someone to support you. But you won't find any support. You feel you need an anchor amidst the unpredictably nature of life. But there won't be an anchor. And you will feel your feet are losing their balance. You will feel you are falling down. You will feel the weight of life pulling you down. And you are drowning in the ocean. And you are shouting for help. But nobody can hear you because everybody is busy living their life to listen to you.

You thus give up on people. You lose faith in people. You lose faith on life.

You just go on living life without feeling anything. You live life in a state of numbness and indifference.

And then one day you look at yourself in the mirror, and you have become a stranger to yourself!”
― Avijeet Das

रोमांच बना रहता है; अंधेरे में गांव में सोते हैं
शरीर पर ठंडे सांप की प्रकृति को समझना
थ्रिलर जो नीचे आया, पेट में गीला और गीला।
आत्माओं, तुम नहीं समझते, शरीर, शरीर, आत्मा।
सगरहंसी का श्वेत गीत जमीन पर उठ गया।
ध्वनि हवा में हवा, ताकि ठंड के मौसम में,
रोना, गर्म स्वभाव प्राप्त करना चाहते हैं
रोमांस को शांत पूरक के साथ मिलाया गया है।”

నేను స్పిన్ చేస్తే ముఖం కళ్ళపై లైట్లు మెరుస్తాయి
అప్పుడు లైట్లు గడ్డం మీద బూట్ లేదా రెండు కఠినంగా ఉంటాయి

సన్నని ఒక క్రూరమైన సమూహాన్ని కుట్టడంలో లైట్లు హేమ్

.
Auf der immergrünen Epiglotis des Lotus randvoll
Die pollengeplapperte Honigbiene winkte mit ihrem Doppeltuch
suchte nach einem betrunkenen Dorf voller stolz rot schlagender Menschenmenge
summende Lieder, die nebeneinander in besorgter Entfernung schlafen”

“History is a test of faith, and the correct response to that test is persistent prayer.”
― Philip Yancey, Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference?

“For somewhere in the back of my mind is that odd explanation that if you whisper a sentence in the ear of one person around a table of many - a short sentence such as "John slept close to a woman with whom he worked" - as those words go around the table, whispered to each person next to another, it might come out, less than a minute later, that John was a sleep-arounder, and he did it with every woman he knew; which meant he probably was gay, because he needed to give the impression of being a raging heterosexual.

Now, if that could happen in one minute, think of the long history of most faiths.”

“במשך אלפי שנים אני הולך על דרכו של כדור הארץ,
ים סינהאלי בחושך הלילה בים המלאי
הפכתי רבים; העולם האפור של בימביסה אשוק
אני הייתי שם; עוד חשכה מרוחקת בוידארב נאגאר;
אני נשמה עייפה, ים החיים מסביב,
בנלטה סן של נטורה נתן לי שלום בלתי מוגבל

השיער הוא nidha כהה של Bidisha,
הפנים הן אמנות עבודתו; אחרי הים "
המפסק של המלח נשבר
כשראה את ארץ הדשא הירוקה באי קינמון,
כמו כן, הוא ראה את החושך; הוא אמר, 'איפה הוא היה כל כך הרבה זמן?'
בנאלטה סן נטורה מרים את עיניו כמו קן ציפור.

בסוף היום, כמו מילות טל
הערב מגיע; ניחוח הכנפיים מנקה את הריח.
כאשר כל הצבעים של העולם נשארים בחוץ, כתבי יד מאורגנים
אז יש נרקומן בצבע של ג'ונאקי;
כל הציפורים נכנסות לבית - כל העסקאות בנחל-הפור הזה;
יש רק חושך, בונלאטה סן פנים אל פנים.

Banalata Sen”

“الدجاج المشوي
نفخة عمودك في الغضب والقتال ، الديك ،
فرحة صاحب السكين
اللدغة مع اللقاح ورفرفة الأجنحة الخاصة بك.
كما قلت: تحريف الأسلحة والحفاظ عليها عازمة
لفة البساط والنزول على الشرفة بعد النوم المضطرب
الأحذية والأحذية ... رذاذة ... رصاصة ... صراخ
يبكي المسنين في الزنزانة التالية ويريد العودة إلى المنزل
حررني ... دعني أذهب ... دعني أذهب للمنزل.
على بيضته في العرش الجرعات
الاختناق في الظلام ... قتال مرة أخرى ، الديك ، ويموت والقتال ، والصراخ مع أخرس.
شظايا الزجاج على اللسان ... جعبة عضلات الصدر
تفتح الأسماك الخياشيم ومياه الضباب
قطعة من الإصبع ملفوفة في ورقة الوردي
مع عيون مغطاة شخص يبكي في منزل السجن لا أستطيع الخروج إذا كان الرجل أو المرأة.
الحفاظ على هذا رمش على كف اليد اليسرى ... ضربة مع أنفاسك
غطاء ثعبان Fanout في الضباب .... ترتدي البطن كوبرا في همسة التبول فام.
ترحيلهم إلى محرقة المحشوة بالدم الملطخة بالأنف ..... في صوف القطن
أحذية من الطوب والقناطر الممزقة في الشوارع
لقد لطخت قدمي مع موجة التقطت من بحر عاصف
هذه هي الأبجدية التي وجهتها للحصول على الحروف.”

“الكربي الراحل -

لم يكن لدى الكربي هذا النوع من الورود في أواخر العشرينات
أنا مجنونة من هذه الصدمة ؛ هل كان هناك أي سوء فهم؟
شخص آخر ، بالطبع ، كان معجب ،
كان البحث طويلاً وخفيفاً ومشرقاً.
في نومي ، مثل أن تمتص
ذهب في قلب الاستخدام.
لا ، هذا ليس جيدًا ، لكنه أيضًا مبارك ،
هذا السلام لا يمكن التنبؤ بها ، والتقييم ، ظل الظل.
إذا لم يكن كذلك ، ألم عدم تناول طعم الكحول ،
القلب مجنون ، يبحث عن ملجأ في الجسد.
مما لا شك فيه أن المرأة تأكل اللحم فقط
في جشعه ، فتح بابه الأبدي ،
في حالة عدم وجود أملاح لا طعم لها بسبب نقص الملح.
لا أحد يريد أن ينهي هذا ، يا أدعياء مفتونين ،
الملح شجي ، حلو.”

“এক কোনে আবদ্ধ, একটুখানি রাত রয়ে গেছে।
আমাদের ভিতু আকাশে নির্মম আঘাতে স্ফূলিঙ্গ উগরে
( নৈশব্দের গাছেরা কিছু দীর্ঘশ্বাস ঝুলিয়ে রেখেছে )
এই শূন্যতার শীর্ষে গরিমার এক গোলাপ জেগে।
ঘুম বড়োই বিশ্বাসঘাতক যেখানে জেলখানা আমায় নিয়ে এসেছে
যদিও আমার গোপন দালানে বেশ আস্পষ্টভাবে
ওই অহংকারী ছোঁড়া গভীরভাবে নিজের জঙ্গলের ভেতর দিয়ে যাচ্ছে
নাবিকদের আলোয় ঝলমলিয়ে যারা শব-সুন্দরী গড়ে তোলে ।”

“মৃত্যুকে
জানি তুমি আসবেই । তাহলে এ প্রতীক্ষা কেন ?
তোমার জন্য আমি পথ চেয়ে : ফুরিয়ে গিয়েছে সব কাজ।
আশার দীপ্র আলো কবে নিভে গেছে । দরোজা রেখেছি খুলে
তোমার নামের এক সরল বিস্ময় আসবে তেমন আশায় ।
অতএব যা-আদল নিতে চাও, নাও : ছুঁড়ে মারো
তোমার বিষাক্ত বোমা আমার বাসাকে লক্ষ্য করে,
কিংবা পেশাদার খুনি-গুণ্ডার লাঠির ঘায়ে মেরে ফ্যালো,
কিংবা কন্ঠে ঠেশে দাও তান্ত্রিক-জ্বরের বিষ-ধোঁয়া,
যদি তুমি তাই চাও, ঘুম পাড়াবার গল্প হয়ে
অসংখ্য নিরপরাধ যেভাবে তোমায় চেনে, এসো :
গুপ্ত পুলিশের নীল টুপিখানা দেখাও আমাকে । ভয়ে কাঠ
মুখে রক্ত উবে-যাওয়া কাজের লোকের হাত কাঁপে ;
আমার পরোয়া নেই । এনিস নদীর স্রোত বয়ে যায়,
মাথার ওপরে জ্বলে উত্তরের তারা
আর প্রিয় চোখ জুড়ে পুরোনো নীলাভ আলো

কথা দাও তুমি আবার আসবে ।
তুমি আর আমি যেন উঁচু
পর্বতমালা আর পরস্পরের কাছাকাছি যেতে পারি না ।
কেবল বার্তা পাঠিও
মাঝরাতে কোনো সময়ে নক্ষত্রদের দিয়ে ।”

তোমার উৎসে স্মৃতি করে যাওয়া আসা
মনে-মনে চলি চঞ্চল অভিযানে,
সাহচর্যেই চলি, নয় অভিমানে,
আমার কথায় তোমারই তো পাওয়া ভাষা।
রক্তের স্রোতে জানি তুমি খরতোয়া,
ঊর্মিল জলে পেতেছি আসনপিঁড়ি,
থৈথৈ করে আমার ঘাটের সিঁড়ি,
কখনো-বা পলিচড়া-ই তোমার দোয়া।
তোমারই তো গান মহাজনী মাল্লার,
কখনো পান্সী-মাঝি গায় ভাটিয়ালি,
কখনো মৌন ব্যস্তের পাল্লায়,
কখনো-বা শুধু তক্তাই ভাসে খালি।
কত ডিঙি ভাঙো, যাও কত বন্দর,
কত কী যে আনো, দেখো কত বিকিকিনি,
তোমার চলায় ভাসাও, স্রোতস্বিনী,”
― Bishnu Dey, স্মৃতি সত্ত্বা ভবিষ্যৎ

“আচ্ছন্ন ঢেউয়ের সাথে মেতে উঠি আমি
ঝিনুক ও নুড়ির কাছে যাই – জলের যোনিতে
বারান্দায় বয়ে আনা হয় তাকে - এলোমেলো শাড়ি
বিশৃঙ্খল রেখাগুলি অভ্যন্তর থেকে ভেঙ্গে পড়ে ...
কেউ এসে পেটিকোট খুলে দিয়েছিল
ফলের শাঁসের মত বুক - হাঁটু গেড়ে স্পর্শ করি
হাতের তালুতে, ত্রিপুরার অচেনা শহরে আমি
মদ নিয়ে বসি অন্ধদের সাথে, ঘুরে ফিরে একই গান
একই অন্ধ গান টুকরো টুকরো কোরে গাওয়া হয়
একই শবের ভেলায় উঠে বসি, নীচে থেকে
আরও হাত উঠে আসে, ‘আমাকেও তুলে নাও...’
এই যে উলঙ্গ হয়ে বসে আছি আরও এক মগ্নতার
ভয়ংকর বুকে, শূন্যতার ভিন্ন এক স্তরে গিয়ে – জানি
ঝুলে থাকা হাত তার উঠে বসে, আমাকে জড়াবে ...”
― Arunesh Ghosh

I And - Poem by Tridib Mitra

Autumn's phantasmagoric tempest
I am at the door of 1964
wooden knocks: who are you?
'Woodpecker! '
What's this?
'Shocked vision! '
Chances, dreams, haha
reality has become very dense
'POOOEEETTT? '
Yet mad in love?”
― Tridib Mitra

“We see the world as fragmented, because we blink. But God, who never blinks, sees the entire universe as we cannot see it. Whole.”
― Regina Brett, God Never Blinks: 50 Lessons for Life's Little Detours

“Life is a helluva journey. You face situations. You meet people. You try to understand situations. You try to understand people.
But you will never ever be able to understand people. You will never ever be able to understand why some things happen.

You feel you desperately need someone to support. But you won't find any support. You feel you need an anchor amidst the unpredictably nature of life. But there won't be an anchor. And you will feel your feet are losing their balance. You will feel you are falling down. You will feel the weight of life pulling you down. And you are drowning in the ocean. And you are shouting for help. But nobody can hear you because everybody is busy living their life to listen to you.

You thus give up on people. You lose faith in people. You lose faith on life.

You just go on living life without feeling anything. You live life in a state of numbness and indifference.

And then one day you look at yourself in the mirror, and you have become a stranger to yourself!”
― Avijeet Das

“O Lord, all our troubles come to us because we do not have our eyes fixed on you. If only we looked at the path we're walking, we would soon arrive. But, we stumble and fall a thousand times and we stray because we do not set our eyes on the true Way.”
― Teresa of Avila, The Way of Perfection

“যখন তুমি ঘুমোও রাতের আস্তাবল ভেঙে ঘোড়ারা
তোমার চ্যাটালো বুকে নামে, আর জানোয়ারগুলোর টগবগ
অন্ধকারকে ছত্রভঙ্গ করে তোলা যেখানে ঘুম নিজের
ক্ষমতার যন্ত্র চালায়, আমার মগজ থেকে ছিঁড়ে
একটুও শব্দ না করেই ।
ঘুম অনেক শাখা তৈরি করে
তোমার পা থেকে ফুল
তাদের কান্নায় কন্ঠরুদ্ধ হয়ে মারা যেতে আমি ভয় পাই ।
তোমার মোলায়ের পাছার বাঁকের ওপরে, মিলিয়ে যাবার আগে
তোমার শাদা ত্বকে তা নীলাভ।
কিন্তু একজন জেল পরিদর্শক কি তোমাকে জাগিয়ে তুলতে পারে, আমার কচি চোর
যখন তুমি তোমার হাত ধুয়ে নাও ( ওই পাখিগুলো তোমার দস্তানায়
ডানা ঝাপটায়, একশো দুঃখের ভারে )
তারপর তুমি নির্দয়ভাবে নক্ষত্রদের আলোকরশ্মিকে ছারখার করে দাও
তোমার কাঁদতে-থাকা মুখের ওপরে ।
তোমার শোকেভরা অবশিষ্টাংশে
মহিমাময় অঙ্গভঙ্গী ধরে রাখা হয়
তোমার হাত যেটা একে ছুঁড়ে দিয়েছিল, রশ্মি দিয়ে বীজ পুঁতেছিল।
তোমার গেঞ্জি, তোমার শার্ট, আর তোমার কালো বেল্ট
আমার জেলখুপরিকে অবাক করে আর আমাকে হতবুদ্ধি করে তোলে
তোমার সুন্দর হস্তিদন্তের সামনে ।”
― Jean Genet, Prisoner of Love

“We wonder why God waits to step in after it’s too late. That’s because with God there is no such thing as too late.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“When we fall to the bottom of the hole that we’ve spent our lives digging, we will find that God was there waiting for us long before we showed up. And in one hand He’s holding all of the shovels that we used to dig it, and in the other He’s got a ladder.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“I don’ know if we believe that things can’t be done. Rather, I think that we’re too fearful to believe that maybe they can.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“আরেকটি রাত

ছেলেটির জলপট্টি বাঁধা কপালে
ঢিপ ঢিপ করে পড়ে জ্বরের হাতুড়ি।
‘মা গো, ওই যে হলুদ পাখি!
ওই যে প্রজাপতি ওড়ে কালো, বেগুনে!’
‘ঘুমা বাছা’ বিছানার পাশে বসে মা
চেপে ধরে সন্তানের ক্ষুদে হাত
‘আমার জ্বলন্ত ফুল, রক্তের জবা, বাবা
কে তোরে এমন করে হিম শীতল করে?’
খোলা নাঙ্গা ঘরে শুধু ল্যাভেন্ডারের মৃদু ঘ্রাণ:
বাইরে ক্রমেই চাঁদ ফুলে পুরুষ্ট হয়,
আঁধার শহরকে, আর শহরের ঘরবাড়ির চূড়ায়
সে শুধু লেপন করে সাদা আর সাদা।
ঝাপসা আলোয়, যেন কোথা থেকে ভেসে আসে
অদৃশ্য বিমানের চাপা গুঞ্জরণ।
‘ঘুমোলি বাজান, আমার শোণিত কুসুম?’
রোয়াকের জানলার কপাট ওঠে কেঁপে, বলে
‘ওহ্, বড্ড শীত, মাগো, হিম শীত, কেবলি যে শীত।”
― Antonio Machado, Antología Poética

“আমি তো হয়েই গেছি একজন নিশিরাত সাথী।
হেঁটেছি বৃষ্টিতে ভিজে– বৃষ্টিতেই ফিরেও এসেছি।
পার হয়ে গেছি আমি শহরের দূরতম বাতি।

সর্বাধিক দুঃখক্লিষ্ট গলি আমি স্বচক্ষে দেখেছি
দায়িত্বপালনকারী দারোয়ানে কাটিয়েছি পাশে।
চোখের দু’পাতা ফেলে, ব্যাখ্যা সব গোপন রেখেছি।

থমকে দাঁড়িয়ে গেছি পদশব্দ যদি কিছু নাশে
কান্নার শব্দের তুল্য– কোনো কান্না দূর থেকে হয়,
পাশের সড়ক থেকে বাড়ির উপর দিয়ে আসে,

কিন্তু কেউ ডাকেনি তো, বিদায় বচনটিও নয়;
আরো দূরে, বহু দূরে অপার্থিব কোনো উচ্চতায়,
আলোকিত ঘড়ি এক আকাশের উল্টো থেকে কয়

না-শুভ বা না-অশুভ এই কাল আজিকার বাতি।
আমি তো রয়েই গেছি একজন নিশিরাত সাথী।”
― Robert Frost, 101 Great American Poems

“আমার উপরে, তোমার উপরে, আর ঐ কাপুচিন
মঠবাসীদের ’পরে
চিকিৎসা-বিদ্যার কিছু জানা সূত্রের নির্ভরে,
ঘড়ির মতন নাগাড়ে, বিরতিহীন
সোল্লাসে বাড়ে নাসাতরু দিনদিন।

রাতারাতি তারা বেড়ে চলে অনুখন
প্রতি নাগরিকে, বিশেষ বা সাধারণ,
সান্ত্রির তথা মন্ত্রীর ’পরে, ধনী তথা গরিবের,
প্যাঁচার মতন নিশি-ডাক ছেড়ে ছেড়ে,
ঠাণ্ডা এবং প্রায়-নিষ্ক্রিয়, মেরে
ফাটিয়ে দিয়েছে মুষ্টিযোদ্ধা যাকে,
অথবা থেঁৎলে গিয়েছে যা দরোজায়,
আর আমাদের স্ত্রী-জাতি পড়োশিদের
সেগুলি যে, আহা, তুরপুন হয়ে ঢোকে
কত দুয়ারের চাবির ছিদ্রে, হায়!

গোগল-মরমি, ঝঞ্ঝেটে আত্মাটি
ধ্যানে জেনেছিল ইহাদের খুঁটিনাটি।

আমার ইয়ার বুগিন্্স্, মদের ঘোরে
স্বপ্ন দেখল, যেন গির্জার চূড়ার মতন চোখা
হয়ে, ঝাড়বাতি-বালতি-গামলা টুটে,
জাগিয়ে এবং বিঁধে ফেলে যত অবাক্ সিলিং, পরে
গেঁথে মেঝেগুলি-খোঁটে
রিসিট যেমন গেঁথে রাখা হয়-তারপর একরোখা
উঠে গেল নির্বাক্
উপরে, আরও উপরে
তার আপনার নাক।

‘এর মানেটা কী?’ পরদিন প্রাতে আমাকেই শুধাল সে।
‘হুশিয়ারি কেয়ামতের: হয়তো,’ আমি বলি, ‘তোর বই-
পত্রের হ’তে পারে পরীক্ষা-নিরীক্ষা শীঘ্রই।’
তিরিশ তারিখে বন্ধু-বেচারা ঢুকে গেল কারাগারে।

কেন, হে প্রধান নাক-বিধায়ক, কেন
বাড়ে আমাদের নাকগুলি, আর কমে আয়ু আমাদের?
কেন এই ছোট মাংসপিণ্ড রাতের অন্ধকারে
আমাদের শুষে ভ্যাম্পায়ার বা সাক্শন-পাম্প্-হেন
খালি করে একেবারে?

এস্কিমো জাতি, এরকম শোনা যায়,
মুখের বদলে নাক দিয়ে চুমু খায়।

আমাদের মাঝে এখন অবধি চলন হয় নি এর।”
― Andrei Voznesensky, An Arrow in the Wall: Selected Poetry and Prose

“সবেধন পুত্র মোর, আমার চেয়েও বেশি ঈশ্বরের তুই
থেকে যা এখানে এই নাশপাতি গাছের বাগানে।
সুপ্রচুর ফলভারে এইখানে গাছেরা আনত
তৃপ্ত আর পরিমিত রঙের বাহারে উদ্ভাসিত;
বার্ধক্যপীড়িত হয়ে তারা যেই কাঁদে, নোনাজল
নয় কোনো, সুমধুর অলস সিরাপে অশ্রু ঝরে।

“আমার নিজের আমি আর আমি থাকি না নিজের”

তাকে দেখে মনে হতো বেগানা নাগর,
চুপচাপ সে-বিদেশি,পদ্মডাঁটা হাতে নিয়ে
এসেছিল আমার দুয়ারে;
ঈশ্বরের জোড়াচক্ষু, ইউসুফেরও চোখের অধিক গনগনে
তার চোখে চোখ রেখে
কী হলো আমার আমি কী করে বোঝাই?

ছিলাম নিজের আমি আর আমি থাকিনি নিজের।

আর এই জনাবারো শ্রমশীল লোক, এরা কারা?
তোর কথা মাথামুণ্ডু কিছুই বুঝি না:
শিখিয়েছি আমি তোকে বুলি; রেখেছি পাখির নামগুলি
যে কোনো শিশুর মতো তুই
দেখাতি ওদের যারা দীর্ঘ পরিযায়ী।
ভিড় থেকে দূরে গিয়ে তুই ফের হয়ে যারে চুপ

“আমার নিজের আমি আর আমি থাকি না নিজের”

আমি যেই কথা বলি মুখভার কেন তোর বাপ?
এই তোর মালামাল, চাকু ও করাত
আর এই হাতুড়িটা বেঞ্চির ওপর। দিনে দিনে
হয় মাপা এইখানে তোর এ-জীবন,
মাপজোক নিয়ে তুই আসবাব বানাস যেমন;
আর আমি পত্নী হেন তোকে দেবো পাঠ;

আমার নিজের হবো আর হবো কেবলই আমার

ইচ্ছেমতো যথাতথা বয়ে চলে বেয়াড়া বাতাস
দিলখোশ না হলে কি কেউ চলে তার অনুরূপ?
আজও মনে পড়ে, তুই গিয়েছিলি আলাপ জমাতে
পশমের আলখাল্লাধারী যতো পণ্ডিতের সাথে।
কানে এলো শহরের তীব্র হট্টগোল;
এ-অশুভ যন্ত্রখানি কে বয়ে বেড়ায়?

“সে তার নিজের আর নয় সে নিজের”

মাড়িয়ে সবুজ আর দ্রুত-তৃণ গালিচা মাড়িয়ে
দেখি এক আজগুবি ছায়া এসে পড়ে
ও মানিক, এই পেটে তোকে আমি ধরেছি রে একা!
ছিলো না নিকটে কোনো কবিরাজ নাড়ি কাটবার;
ডাকবো না তোকে আমি প্রভু বলে ওরে
সবেধন পুত্র মোর, দে আমায় সাড়া!

“আমার নিজের আমি আর আমি নই তো নিজের।”
― Thom Gunn, Collected Poems

“সচেতন একজন দায়িত্বশীল নিগ্রোর কাছে অনেক ক্ষমতা

ভয়ার্ত?
দায়িত্বশীল নিগ্রোরা কি দৌড়চ্ছে
ভয়ার্ত হয়ে?

আমার বোধগম্য হচ্ছে আমার বিরুদ্ধে আইনী ব্যবস্থা নেয়া হবে।
এবং তুমি বলছো তোমার পক্ষে সম্ভব হবে না
পনেরো’শ জাতীয় পুরুষ রক্ষীকে ঠেকানো
ফলে তুমি আমার দুঃখী কালো সত্তার সবখানি ছাল ছাড়াবে।
(কোনো সন্দেহ নেই আমি তোমার পুরুষাঙ্গ উচ্ছেদ করে ফেলেছি)

ডিনামাইট তোমাদের নজরে পড়েছে
আর তোমরা নিজেরা পুলিশকে বলে দিয়েছো।
তোমাদের জিভ ছিঁড়ে ফেলা হবে
কেননা তোমাদের বুদ্ধি নেই তা সামলাবার।

তুমি না ঘুরে দাড়িয়ে
সহনশীলতা শেখাচ্ছ
কী করে আমি সহ্য করবো
জেনোসাইড
আমার কাপ পূর্ণ
এবং তুমি তো জানো
আমাদের কোনো সামর্থ্য নেই
বাসনা চরিতার্থ করায় দেরি করতে।

আমি শুধু চাই প্রত্যয়ী হয়ে নিজেকে ঘোষণা করতে
এমনকি আমি চাই তুমিও নিজেকে আবার দাবি করো
কিন্তু বার বার আমার মনে হচ্ছে
হে দায়িত্ববান নিগ্রো
তোমার মৃত্যু হচ্ছে
আমার নিজের সত্তাকে দাবি করার প্রথম পদক্ষেপ
এটা খুবই দুঃখের
আমি সাধারণ ভাবে এখন থামতাম কিংবা কাঁদতাম
কিন্তু সন্ধ্যা ঘনিয়ে আসছে
এবং আমাকে সমঝোতায় বসতে হবে
আমার নিজস্ব গোষ্ঠির মানুষের স্বাধীনতার জন্যে।

আমি একাকী নই

আমি একাকী নই
শুধু ঘুমুচ্ছি একেবারেই একা।

তুমি জানো আমি ভীতু
কিন্তু আমি একজন প্রাপ্তবয়স্ক মহিলা
আমি কান্না
বা সেরকম কিছু করি না।

আমার একটি বড় বিছানা আছে
যাতে আমি ঘুরপাক খেতে পারি
এবং এতে অনেক জায়গা রয়েছে।
আমি কোনো স্বপ্ন দেখি না
খারাপ স্বপ্ন দেখি না
আগের মতো যে
তুমি আমাকে ছেড়ে
চলে যাবে।

এখন যেহেতু তুমি চলে গেছো
ফলে আমি কোনো স্বপ্ন দেখি না
এবং তুমি যা কিছুই ভাবো না
আমি একাকী নই
শুধু ঘুমুচ্ছি
একেবারেই একা।”
― Nikki Giovani, The Mentalist: Saison 7

“তিন ঝাড়

বলল রমণী একদা প্রিয়েরে তার,
‘হায়, সেই প্রেমে আস্থা রাখে না কেউ
যে-প্রেমে সঠিক খাদ্য অপ্রতুল;
আর, যদি তুমি হারাও সে-প্রেমকেই
গাইবে কীভাবে আর ও-প্রেমের গান?
ত্রুটি যে আমার সত্যিই অতিকায়।
ও প্রিয় আমার, ও প্রিয় আমার।

‘কক্ষে তোমার প্রদীপ রেখো না জ্বেলে,’
বলে রমণীয়া রমণী সে পুনরায়,
‘গোপনে, যখন রাত্রি দ্বিপ্রহর,
আসব তোমার অপেক্ষ শয্যায়,
নিজেকেই নিজে যদি তা করতে দেখি,
মনে হয়, আমি ম’রে যাব লজ্জায়।’
ও প্রিয় আমার, ও প্রিয় আমার।

‘গোপনে গোপনে ভালবাসি আমি তাকে,
দাসী রে আমার, বলি তোকে, বলল সে,
‘আমি জানি, আমি ম’রে যাব বুক ফেটে
যদি সে তিলেক আমাকে ভালো না বাসে,
কিন্তু আমার শুচিতা নিছনি দিলে
তখনই-বা প্রাণ ধরব কীভাবে, কীসে?
ও প্রিয় আমার, ও প্রিয় আমার।

‘কাজেই, তোকেই শুতে হবে তার পাশে,
ও যেন ভাবতে পারে যে আমিই সেটা।
আর, মনে হয়, আমরা সবাই একই
জ্বলে না যখন কোনোই প্রদীপ সেথা,
আর, মনে হয়, আমরা সবাই একই
যখন শরীর- ঢাকা নয় পোশাকে তা।’
ও প্রিয় আমার, ও প্রিয় আমার।

না-ডাকতে কোনো কুকুর, ঘণ্টা-ধ্বনি
মধ্যরাতের- শুনে সে বলত নিজে,
‘ভাগ্যে মাথায় এসেছিল চিন্তাটা,
কী-সুখী আমার প্রিয়েরে দেখাচ্ছে যে’;
অথচ যখন দাসীটিকে সারাদিন
ঝিমাতে দেখত- ব্যথা কি উঠত বেজে?
ও প্রিয় আমার, ও প্রিয় আমার।

‘না, আর কোনোও গান নয়,’ বলল সে,
‘কেননা প্রেয়সী এসেছিল চুপিসারে
এক-সাল আগে পয়লাবারের মতো
দুপুর-রাতের প্রহরে আমার ঘরে,
এবং ঘড়ির ঘণ্টাটি বাজলেই
শুতে যে হবেই আমাকে চাদর মুড়ে।’
ও প্রিয় আমার, ও প্রিয় আমার।

‘হাসি-কান্নার গান, পবিত্র গান,
কামনার গান’- বলেছিল লোকগুলো।
কেউ কি কখনও শুনেছে অমোন গান?
না- কেবল তারা সেইদিনই শুনেছিল।
কেউ কি অমোন হাঁকিয়েছে ঘোড়া আর?
না- শুধু সেদিন সে-ই তা হাঁকিয়েছিল।
ও প্রিয় আমার, ও প্রিয় আমার।

কিন্তু যেমনি ঘোড়াটির এক খুর
ইঁদুর-গর্তে গেল বিলকুল ঢুকে,
মাথা নীচে দিয়ে প’ড়েই সে ম’রে গেল
তার প্রেয়সীর চ’ক্ষের সম্মুখে-
হায় সে-ও ম’রে গেল যে তৎক্ষণাৎ,
এমনই আঘাত বেজেছিল তার বুকে।
ও প্রিয় আমার, ও প্রিয় আমার।

দাসীটি কেবল বহুদিন বেঁচে তার
কবর-দু’টির তদারকি করে, আর
দু’-কবরে দু’টি বুনেছিল সে যে ঝাড়;
যখন সেগুলি বড় হ’ল, তো সবার
মনে হ’ত, একই শিকড়ে তাদের বাড়,
গোলাপও তাদের মিলেমিশে একাকার।
ও প্রিয় আমার, ও প্রিয় আমার।

যখন দাসীর মরণের এল কাল,
পুরুত এসেছে তার পাপ-নিরাময়ে,
গোপন যা-কিছু ক’য়ে দিল বুড়ি তায়।
তাকিয়ে থাকল মুখে তার মূক হ’য়ে
পুরোহিত, আর সে ছিল সমঝদার,
বুড়িটার কথা শুনেছিল সে হৃদয়ে।
ও প্রিয় আমার, ও প্রিয় আমার।

কবর দিতে সে বলল সে-দাসীটার
তার কর্ত্রীর প্রিয়ের অপর পাশে,
তার কবরেও লাগাল গোলাপঝাড়,
আর তারপর যে-কেউ সেখানে আসে
গোলাপ তুলতে ঝাড়গুলি থেকে, কার
শিকড় কোথায়, জানতেই পারে না সে।
ও প্রিয় আমার, ও প্রিয় আমার।”
― W.B.Yeats, Irish Fairy Tales

“কান পেতে শোনার শীত

আমি ছাড়া কেউ কোথাও নেই
আগুনের ধারে
আমার হাত চনমন করে
করতল টকটকে লাল
আর রাতের বাতাস উড়িয়ে নেয়
তামাম সব, বাইরের পৃথিবীতে।

মুহূর্তের তুচ্ছ দুর্ভাবনায় কী হবে,
ততক্ষণ আকাশের আলখাল্লা
কালো হয়ে নেমে
ঘিরে ফেলেছে, যা কিছু বেঁচে।

নিজের ভিতরে যা মূল্যবান
তাকে মন দিয়ে
জানার উপায় কী?
জানতে গিয়ে সেসব কেবল
হারিয়ে যায়

আমাদের নিখুঁত হতে চাওয়া
আকাঙ্ক্ষাগুলি
আমাদের আলোকিত দেবদূত
ক’রে
তোলে না কিছুতেই

যা টালমাটাল করে
তার ভিতরেই
আমাদের গোপন পোষণ।

যা আমরা
ঘৃণা করি নিজের ভিতরে
তা হৃদয়ের দিকে তাকিয়ে
চেনা কঠিন
আর সত্তার নক্সাকে
ব্যাখ্যা করার কিছু নেই।

প্রত্যেক হৃদয়ে
আনন্দের গভীর চিৎকার
জন্ম নেবার অপেক্ষায়
টনটন করছে।

এমন কি সূর্যপ্লাবিত দিন
যখন অনেক দূর মনে হয়
তখনো
সেই চিৎকার যেন সবুজ
এক বৃক্ষ হয়ে উঠে
পৃথিবীর কাছে
হাজির হবে।

কতো বছর
সেসব মানুষের সঙ্গে
কাটিয়েছি আমি
যাদের বলার মতো
কিছুই ছিল না।

কতো বছর ভুলে ছিলাম
শুধু কান পেতে থাকলেই
সব কিছু আপন
হতে পারে।

আর ধীরে ধীরে
খুব কষ্টে
মনে পড়ে যায়
কী করে সব কিছু এক
বিপরীত, অলৌকিক
অপর বাস্তবতা
থেকে জন্ম নেয়।

নীরবতা আর শীত
আমাকে সেই
অপরের কাছে
নিয়ে এসেছে।

এই কান-পেতে-শোনা
শীতের দিন
আমার কাছে সেই নতুন জীবন
ডেকে আনতে পারবে, আমি জানি
যে জীবনকে
আপন
ব’লে ডাকতে পারি।

প্রত্যেকটি শব্দের একটা ঘর আছে
যেখান থেকে সে আসে
আর একটা দরজা আছে
যেখান থেকে সে বেরিয়ে
নতুন ঘরে যায়।

আমরা সেইসব স্বরেই
কথা বলতে পারি
যে স্বর আমরা কান পেতে শুনি
আমাদের শরীরের কণ্ঠস্বর
কেবল সেই ধ্বনিতে কথা বলে
পৃথিবীর যেটুকু শরীরের স্বর
তার চেনা।

তখন নিজেই সে এক আস্ত পৃথিবী
কান পেতে শুনতে শুনতে এক
স্বকীয় ভুবন।

এভাবে সে জানতে পারে
তার কেমন হতে হবে
কী করতে হবে।

আর এই রাত্রির ডামাডোলে
আমি এক কাঠবাদামের ডালে
দোল খেতে শুনি কোনো শিশুকে
ডালটা দাঁড়িয়ে থাকা কালো পায়ের মতো
বাতাসে দোলে আর শব্দ করে
বৃষ্টির ঝাপটা এখন আমার জানালায়
আর এই হিমবাতাস আর তারা-ভরা রাতে
অদৃশ্য সব ঝোরা
যেন গ্রীষ্মের উষ্ণতায় সাপের মতো
জট খোলে
প্রত্যেকটি এক এক
অকল্পিত ফুটন্ত গোলাপ।”
― David White, 2019 Devotions Volume 1 - God, how do I do your will?: Way 2019 Maker

“মোটাসোটা লোকে খোঁজে সুতীক্ষ্ণ ইস্পাত পাতে
হাল্কা পাতলা লোকে খোঁজে তারে সব শেষ ভাতে
ফাঁপা লোক খোঁজে তারে বুননের কারখানাটাতে
মর্যাদা থাকেন কোথায়।

জ্ঞানীলোক খোঁজে তারে তৃণদের ধারালো ফলায়
তরুণেরা খোঁজে তারে ছায়া যেটা পাশ দিয়ে যায়
গরিবেরা রঙচঙে কাঁচ পরে সম্মুখে তাকায়
মর্যাদা থাকেন কোথায়।

নব বরষের দিনে সহসাই এক লোক খুন হয়ে যায়
বলেছিল একজন, মর্যাদাটা সকলের আগেই হারায়
খুঁজতে গেলাম তারে বৃহৎ নগরে, খুঁজতে গেলাম তারে মাঝারি শহরে
গেলাম সেখানে আমি মাঝরাতে যেইখানে সুরুয শানায়

তাকালাম উপরেতে তাকালাম নিচে
তাকালাম চারদিকে আগে আর পিছে
জিজ্ঞেস করলাম সকল পুলিশে
মর্যাদা থাকেন কোথায়?

অন্ধলোক একজন ঘোর-লাগা কেটে ওঠে থমকে দাঁড়ায়
ডানে বাঁয়ে দুপকেটে দুই হাত ঢুকিয়ে সে খোঁজে আর চায়
হঠাৎ রহস্যগুণে অজানা কারণে যদি খোঁজ মিলে যায়
মর্যাদা থাকেন কোথায়!

মেরিলাউ নামধারী যুবতীর বিয়েবাড়ি গিয়ে তাকে যখন সুধাই
সে বলেছে, “তুমি আমি কথা বলি চুপি চুপি সেটা যেন না দেখে সবাই”
বলেছে সে, খুন হবে যদি কেউ বলে দেয় মর্যাদা সে আছে কোন ঠাঁই।
মর্যাদা থাকেন কোথায়।

গিয়েছি খুঁজতে তারে যেখানে শকুন খানা খায়
যেতাম গভীরে আরো, প্রয়োজন পড়েনি সেটায়
সেখানে শুনেছি বাণী দেবদূতদের, সেখানে শুনেছি কথা জনমানবের
তফাৎ কী বুঝিনি তো হায়!
মর্যাদা থাকেন কোথায়”
― Bob Dylan, 100 Songs

“যুদ্ধ

তড়িঘড়ি ঘোড়ায় করে দূতের হাতে সম্রাটের কাছে চিঠি পাঠালেন মেয়র।
তাতে লেখা: নগরীতে প্যারাগুয়েন সৈন্যরা হামলা করছেন, সত্বর সাহায্য প্রয়োজন।
সম্রাট দূতের কাছ থেকে চিঠিটা পেলেন দু’মাস পর।
যখন সহায়তাকারীরা এসে পৌঁছালো, তখন প্যারাগুয়েনরা ওখান থেকে চলে গ্যাছে।
সম্রাটের লোকজন তাই ফিরে এলো পনের যুবতী ও যাত্রাপথের জন্য যতসামান্য রসদ নিয়ে।
আমার মনে হয় ওরা এর পুরোটাই সাবাড় করেছিল।
করুম্বা এমন এক শহর, যার বাসিন্দারা খুব ভালোভাবে মিশে গ্যাছে প্যারাগুয়েনদের সাথে।”
― Manuel de Baros

“সুশ্রী মহিলারা বিস্মিত হয় আমার রহস্যটা কি ভেবে।
আমার নেই কোন আকর্ষণ কিংবা শারিরীক সৌষ্ঠব।
যেমন থাকে ফ্যাশন মডেলদের,
কিন্তু যখন ওদের শোনাই আমার গল্প,
ওরা ভাবে আমি বুঝি বানিয়ে বলছি।
আমি বলি,
সবই তো আমার নাগালের ভেতর,
আমার পশ্চাদের আকার
আমার পা ফেলার ভঙ্গি,
আমার ঠোঁটের বাঁক।
কারণ আমি এক নারী
বিস্ময়করভাবে।
বিস্ময়কর নারী,
সে তো আমিই।

আমি যখন কোন ঘরে ঢুকি
ঠিক যেমনভাবে আমাকে ঢুকতে দেখতে চান
কিংবা কোন পুরুষের দিকে এগোই,
তারা সবাই উঠে দাঁড়ায় কিংবা
হাঁটু ভেঙে সৌজন্য দেখায়,
কিন্তু তার পরই ভনভন ছেঁকে ধরে একসময়
ঠিক এক ঝাঁক মৌমাছি যেমন।
আমি ভাবি,
বোধ হয় আমার চোখের ভেতরের আগুন,
কিংবা আমার সুন্দর দাঁতের ঝিলিক,
অথবা আমার নিতম্বের স্পন্দন,
কিংবা আমার পায়ের ছন্দ,
এসব মিলিয়ে বিস্ময়কর নারী আমি।

বিস্ময়কর নারী
সে তো আমিই।
পুরুষরা বিস্ময়ে হতবাক
আমার ভেতরের আমাকে দেখে।
অথচ সেটাকে ছুঁতে তারা অক্ষম,
আমর গভীরের সেই অলৌকিকতাকে।
আমি যখন তাদের কাছে উম্মোচন করতে চাই
আমার অন্তরের অতলকে,
তখনও তাদের দৃষ্টিগোচর হয় না সেই অতল।

আমি বলি,
রহস্যটা আমার দুষ্টু গ্রীবার ভাঁজে,
আমার হাসির রৌদ্রকরোজ্বলে,
আমার নিশ্বাসের উঠানামায়,
যা দিয়ে গড়া আমার একান্ত গভীর-গভীরতর শৈলী।
আমি এক নারী,
বিস্ময়রভাবে।
বিস্ময়কর নারী,
সে তো আমিই।

এখন নিশ্চয় সবাই বুঝতে পারছেন
আমি মাথা কেন নোয়াই না।
আমার কন্ঠস্বর অযথা উচ্চমার্গে ওঠে না,
কিংবা অকারণে হই না অস্থির,
কথা বলি না কঠিন স্বরভঙ্গীতে।
আমাকে পাশ দিয়ে যেতে দেখলে
কেন আপনারা অযথা প্রগলভ, বুঝি না।
আমি ভাবি,
আমার চলার শব্দ,
আমার চুলের বিন্যাস,
আমার কোমল করতল,
আমার যত্নের আলতো স্পর্শ,
আপনাদের সবারই ভীষণ ভীষণ প্রয়োজন।
কারণ আমি এক নারী
বিস্ময়করভাবে।
বিস্ময়কর নারী,
সে তো আমিই।”
― Maya Angelou, And Still I Rise

“শোন, ঝড়ো পশ্চিমের উদ্দাম বাতাস
তুমি শরতের বয়ে চলা গভীর নিঃশ্বাস।

ঝরে পড়া পাতাদের কর তুমি তাড়া
ওঝার যাদুতে যেন ছোটে অশরীরি অশুভ প্রেতেরা।

হলুদাভ, কালো, ফিকে জ্বরতপ্ত লাল
রোগাক্রান্ত মানুষের মত পাতাদের রং আর গাল।

তোমার পাখায় ভর করে
ডানা মেলা বীজ ঝাঁক বেঁধে ওড়ে

নীচু, কৃষ্ণ, মাটি তার অতল গভীরে
মৃতদের মত অসাড় শরীরে
প্রতীক্ষায় থাকে তারা
যে তোমার সহোদরা

বসন্তের সুনীল বাতাস আসবে কখন?
তূর্যধ্বনি বাজাবে তখন।

সুরেলা মধুর সুরে
পৃথিবীর সব স্বপ্ন পরিপূর্ণ করে

বাতাসের রাজ্যে সুমিষ্ট বীজেরা তোলে শোরগোল
লুটোপুটি খায় মেষ পালকের পিছু যেন চঞ্চল মেঘের দল।

সমতল, পাহাড়ের রন্ধ্রে রন্ধ্রে
ভরে ওঠে বুনো রঙ, ফুলের সুগন্ধে
আত্মার উদ্দাম সাহসের মতো
তুমি দিকে দিকে তোল ঘূর্ণাবর্ত

তুমিইতো ধ্বংস কর
তুমিইতো রক্ষা কর

বাতাসের বন্য আত্মা
কথা শুনে যাও
কথা শুনে যাও।

২
তুমি যার স্রোতধারা গভীর আকাশে আন্দোলিত
ঝরে পড়ে মেঘেরা পাতার মত

স্বর্গমর্ত্যব্যাপী দুই সুবিশাল মহীরূহ যারা
তাদের শাখারা
জড়াজড়ি করে কাঁপে
তোমার চাবুকে।

পাতা ঝরে পড়ে
মেঘ হয়ে ওড়ে।

এই মেঘ ডেকে আনে সজল বিদ্যুৎ
এই মেঘ বৃষ্টি ঝড় বাতাসের দূত।
নীল আন্দোলিত তুমি, সেই তরঙ্গের পরে
এই মেঘ ঝরে আর ঝরে।

ও বাতাস
বেপরোয়া ও হাওয়া
রক্তিম মদের দেবতার পিছু উদ্দাম ধাওয়া
করা যেন তুমি সেই নারী-

ক্ষিপ্তা, ভয়ংকরী
যার এলোমেলো, রুখু চুল ওড়ে আর ওড়ে
দিগন্তের প্রান্ত ছুঁয়ে অনেক ওপরে

আকাশের সবচেয়ে ওপর বিন্দুতে
প্রলয়ের এলোচুল ক্ষিপ্ত ভঙ্গিতে ওই ওড়ে

তুমি বছরের শেষ গীত
তার শব-মিছিলের শোকার্ত সঙ্গীত
এই শেষ অন্ধকার রাত
বছরের কবর গৃহের অর্ধ-গোলাকার ছাদ

ভেসে উড়ে যাওয়া বাষ্পরা
সর্বশক্তি জড়ো করা
সংবদ্ধ প্রয়াসে নির্মাণ
করে যার নিরেট খিলান।

শোন, তুমি শোন
ঝড়ের বাতাস
শরতের উতলা নিঃশ্বাস।

৩
সান্দ্র সংক্ষুদ্ধ তোমার অভিঘাতে
সাগরের ঘুম ভাঙে ঢেউয়ের কষাঘাতে

আটলান্টিকের অসীম তরঙ্গ
পথ ছেড়ে দেয়, তোলে নিবিড় সুরঙ্গ

ভূমধ্যসাগর অবসন্ন থাকে গভীর তন্দ্রায়
আঁকাবাঁকা সুশীতল স্রোতের ধারায়।

উপসাগরের দূর একা প্রান্ত থেকে
লাভা সঞ্চিত আগ্নেয় দ্বীপ দেখে আর দেখে।

সাগরে ঘুমায় কত পুরনো দিনের প্রাসাদের চূড়া।
গভীর ঢেউয়ে থেকে থেকে কেঁপে ওঠে যারা।
তাদের শরীর, ঢেউ, জল চারপাশ
অলংকৃত করে সুগন্ধী শৈবাল ফুল, সাগরের ঘাস।

তোমার প্রবল ধ্বনি, তার আহ্বান
শুনে নীল ফুল হয় বিহ্বল, ম্লান।
শুনে যাও ও বাতাস
বেপরোয়া ঝড়।

৪
উড়ে যাওয়া পাতার মতো তুলে নিয়ে যাও
হালকা মেঘের মত দ্রুত গতি দাও
দোলা দাও যেন ঢেউ, পাতা ভেবে ফেল ছুঁড়ে
ধূসর ভাবনা রাশি উড়িয়ে বিদায় করে
ব্রহ্মান্ডের পারে।

স্বর্গ ছুঁয়ে ফেলা যাত্রা কর তুমি যেমন উতলা
নিরুদ্দেশ ছিলো তেমনি আমার ছেলেবেলা
সময়ের সুবিশাল ভারে আজ চাবুকে বিক্ষত
হতে চাই তোমার মতই পলকা, অপার গর্বিত

নেবে কি উড়িয়ে ওই অসুখের দেশ থেকে
জীবনের কাঁটারা রক্তাক্ত করে থেকে থেকে

নাও ভেবে গভীর অরণ্য এক, বাজাও বীণার মত
সময় করেছে বর্ণহীন, আজ পাতা ঝরে গেছে শত।

শোনাও আমার গান, ডেকে ডেকে বল
আর নেই অন্ধকার, অশুভ ফুরোলো

তোমার কণ্ঠের সুরে হবো বন্য গান
চারদিকে ভেসে যাবে রূপময় আহ্বান।

যতই বিষণ্ণ হই, আমি তবুও মধুর
তোমার গানের মত বেদনা বিধুর

দিনগুলো হবে দেখ সোনার মোহর
আবার আসবে ফিরে মহৎ প্রহর।

মহামানবের মত আমার তীব্রতা
অবশেষে মুছে দেবে অলস জীর্ণতা।

অগ্নিকান্ড নিভে গেছে, পড়ে আছে ছাই
ছিট ফোঁটা ফুলকির মতো তবু আলো দিয়ে যাই।

শীতার্ত দিনগুলো ফিকে হয়ে যায়
রেশমী বসন্ত এসে ডাক দেয় ‘আয়’।”
― P. B. Shelly

“আয়না

গতকাল
মেঘ তখনও ভেসে চলেছে
ঘরটার কালো গহনলোকে।
কিন্তু এখন আয়নাটা শূন্য

আকাশ থেকে
জট খোলা সুতোর বলের মতো
তুষার ঝরছে।”
― Yeve Bonfoy

“কাউকে করো না দায়ী

কারোর বিরুদ্ধ তুমি কোরো না নালিশ কখনোই,
কোন কিছুকেই দায়ী কোরো না কখনো;
কারণ জীবনে তুমি যা চেয়েছ
তা-ই তুমি করেছ মূলত।
মেনে নাও নির্মানের অন্তরায় আর
নিজেকে শোধরানোর শুরুর সাহস।
ভুলের ভস্ম থেকে উঠে আসে প্রকৃত
মানুষের সফলতা।
কখনো কোরো না দায়ী নিয়তি ও একাকিত্বকে
মোকাবেলা করো সব সাহসের সঙ্গে।
যেকোনভাবেই হোক-এ তোমারই কাজের ফসল,
তুলে ধরো নিয়ত জয়ের লক্ষণ।
নিজের ব্যার্থতায় তিক্ত হোয়ো না আর
অন্যের কাঁধে তাকে দিয়ো না চাপিয়ে,
এই বেলা মেনে নাও কিংবা শিশুর মতো”
― Pablo Neruda, 200 Poemas De Amor

“শোকগাথা

আমি প্রথম দরজা খুলি।
সূর্য-করোজ্জ্বল বিশাল ঘর।
একটি ভারী যান সড়ক পেরিয়ে যায়
আর চীনামাটি কেঁপে ওঠে।

আমি দ্বিতীয় দরজা খুলি।
বন্ধুরা, তোমরা পান করলে অন্ধকার
আর দৃশ্যমান হলে।

তিন নম্বর দরজা। সরু একটি
হোটেল কক্ষ
রাস্তার পিছন দিকে মুখ করা।

আলকাতরার ওপরে বাতির স্ফুলিঙ্গ
অভিজ্ঞতার সুন্দর মরিচা।”
― Tomas Transtromayar

“হলোগ্রাম
লুইস আলবের্তো ব্রাবোকে

আমার ভাষাটি
আর আমার নয়
আজ আমি পাথরের
এখন আমি কথা বলি মাটির ভাষায়

ধুলিমেঘপুঞ্জ
আমাকে জানায়
নতুন নতুন সব প্রতীকসমূহ

আমি আজ আমার নিজের
হলগ্রাম”
― Augusto Rodriguez, Matar a la Bestia, 2004-2007

“এই দশম কবিতা
এবং এই শেষ। শেষাবধি
এই ঠিক, সেই এক
এবং শূন্য
হেঁটে যায় একসাথে,
এইসব পাতার শেষপ্রান্তে,
একটি প্রাণ
শূন্যতার পাশাপাশি হেঁটে যায়

অন্তিম হল দীপ্তি,
আর এই সেই দীপ্তি, সেই উজ্জ্বলতা,
যা ধরে রাখে তাদের যারা চলে গেছে আগে।
এবং যখন তার সমাপ্তি হয়
তখন কিছুই নেই, অবশিষ্ট থাকে না কিছুই,

পুরাতন গাড়ির মরচে পড়া জীর্ণতায়
তীরন্দাজের শরীরে দীর্ণ করা ছিদ্রে
নদীর কুয়াশা ঘ্রাণে আনে পাথরে ব্যাপ্ত ক্লান্তি,”
― Gallway Kinnell

“Prayer without work leads to the poor house”
― Mac Duke The Strategist

“On every trip back to the Midwest, I step aside from my schedule and visit my parent’s graves. And with trimmers in hand I kneel down and I cut back the intruding grasses and occasional weed that has edged up against their headstones. It is not in grief that I do this, but in the fondest recollection. The tears that often visit me there are those of joy; that God had thought enough of me to bless me with parent’s rich in love, ever bound by sacrifice, and sturdy in faith despite the nature of the adversities that so often beset them. And as I leave their graves and head back to the pressing demands of my world, I depart with the commitment to live my life in a manner that my children will find no grief at my grave, but joy in knowing that God chose me for them.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“To Her Steady Lover - Poem by Jibanananda Das


There is no meaning in living—I don't say this.
There is meaning for some, may be for all—may be a perfect meaning.
Yet I hear the white sound of wind-driven birds
In the water of the distant seas
beneath the burning summer sun.

The candle burns slowly, very slowly, on my table;
The books of intellect are more still—unwavering— lost in meditation;
Yet when you go out on to the streets
or even while sitting by the window side
Will you sense the frenzied dance of violent waters;

Right beside that a book of your cheeks; no more like a lantern,
Perhaps like a conch-shell lying on the beach as if ocean's father
It is also a music by his own merit—like Nature:
caustic—lovable—finally like the most favourite entity.

So I get the taste of expansive wind in the airing
of maddening grievances;
Otherwise in the mind's forest the python coils up around the doe:
I feel the pitiable hint of a life like that in the Sceptre of protest.
Some glacier-cold still flock of Cormorants will realize my words;
When the electric-compass of life will cease
They will eat up snow-grey sleep like polar seas in endless grasp.”
― Jibanananda Das, Selected Poems

“काली अँधेरी रात थी फाल्गुन की
पंचमी का चाँद भी डूब चुका था तब,
मरना तो उसे था ही,
सुना है
कल रात पोस्टमॉर्टेम के लिए ले गये उसे।

पास ही लेटी थी पत्नी और बच्चा भी था,
बिखरी थी चाँदनी चारों ओर, और था प्रेम, और थी आशा,
फिर भी ना जाने क्यों आया था नजर उसे एक भूत?
खुल गई थी आँखें उसकी या फिर बरसों से सोया ही नहीं था वह,
सोया हुआ है जो अब भयावह शवगृह के इस सुनसान अंधकार में।

क्या ऐसी ही नींद चाहा था उसने?
अँधेरे नम बसबसाते कमरे में सोया पड़ा है आज,
प्लेग से रक्तरंजित ढलके गरदन वाले चूहे जैसा,
कभी नहीं जागने के लिए।

“कभी उठोगे नहीं क्या
ज़िंदगी का असह्य भार और वेदना
और नहीं झेलोगे क्या?”
उसकी खिड़की से झाँक कर निःस्तब्धता ने
पूछा था, जब
चाँद भी हो चुका था विलीन उस जटिल अन्धकार में।

उल्लू तो सोने की तैयारियों में लग चुका था,
गली में टर्राता मेढ़क मगर मांग रहा था दो मुहूर्त और,
सुबह की लाली दस्तक देने जा रही थी उसी अनुराग से,
और मैं झेल रहा था चारों ओर से मसहरी का क्षमाहीन विरोध,
जो दिख ही नहीं रहा था इस धुंधले निरुद्देश्य अंधकार में,
मच्छर लेकिन तब भी जाग रहा था जीवन स्रोत की चाह में।

आकाश घनिष्ठ हो उठा और भी, मानो कोई एक विकीर्ण जीवन
नचा रहा हो उँगलियों पर उसके मन को,
दूर किसी बच्चे के हाथों में फंस कर मौत से लड़ते झींगुर का क्रंदन,
चाँद भी डूब गया,
और इस विचित्र अंधियारे में, तुम,
हाथों में पाश लिए खड़ी हो, एकाकी, उसी पीपल तले,
जानती हुई भी कि झींगुर, पक्षी और मानव एक नहीं हैं।

पीपल की शाखों ने किया नहीं विरोध?
हरे नर्म झूमते पत्तों से झाँककर किया नहीं प्रतिकार जुगनूओं ने?
गंध के सहारे ही ढूंढ कर पूछा नहीं था उल्लुओं ने – “बूढ़ा चाँद
तो बह गया बाढ़ में, चलो एक-दो चूहे ही पकड़ें”?
चीख कर बताया तो नहीं था उसी ने ये दर्दनाक खबर?

जीवन का ये आस्वाद,
पतझड़ की किसी शाम में महकता जौ,
सह नहीं सके ना?
अब इस शवगृह में आराम से तो हो?
इस शवगृह के दमघोंटू अन्धकार में
रक्तरंजित होंठ और चपटे माथे वाले किसी चूहे की तरह।

सुनो,
मृत्यु की कहानी फिर भी,
व्यर्थ नहीं जाता कभी किसी नारी का प्रणय और
विवाहित जीवन की साध,
समय के साथ आती है पत्नी और
फिर मधुबर्षा,
कभी कांपा नहीं जो शीत और भूख की वेदना से,
आज लेटा है
इस शवगृह में,
चित किसी टेबल पर

जानता हूँ,
हाँ, मैं जानता हूँ,
नारी मन में,
प्रेम, वात्सल्य, घर, नव परिधान,
अर्थ, कीर्ति, और आराम ही सब कुछ नहीं है,
इससे अलग भी कुछ है,
जो हमारे अंदर खेलता है,
और कर देता है हमें
क्लांत,
और क्लांत,
और भी क्लांत।

आज इस शवगृह में नहीं है वो क्लांति,
तभी तो आज लेटा है वह चित किसी टेबल पर यहाँ।

फिर भी रोज रात देखता हूँ मैं,
एक बूढ़ा उल्लू बैठता है पीपल की डालों पर,
पलकें झपकाता है और कहता है – “चाँद तो लगता है बह गया बाढ़ में,
अच्छा है,
चलो पकड़ें एकाध चूहे को ही”।

वो बूढ़ी नानी, आज भी वैसी ही है,
मैं भी हो जाऊंगा एक दिन उसकी तरह,
डूबा दूँगा इस बूढ़े चाँद को तब किसी चक्रवात में।

और फिर चलें जायेंगे हम दोनों,
शून्य कर
इस प्रिय संसार को।”
― Jibanananda Das, Selected Poems

“अंतरटॉनिक

बीड़ी फूँकती हो अवंतिका
चुंबन में श्रम का स्वाद पाता हूँ
देसी पीती हो अवंतिका
श्वास में नींद की गंध पाता हूँ
गुटखा खाती हो अवंतिका
जीभ पर रक्त का स्पर्श पाता हूँ
जुलूस में जाती हो अवंतिका
पसीने में तुम्हारे दिवास्वप्न पाता हूँ”
― Malay Roychoudhury, Selected Poems

“ওঃ মরে যাব মরে যাব মরে যাব
আমার চামড়ার লহমা জ্বলে যাচ্ছে অকাট্য তুরুপে
আমি কী কোর্বো কোথায় যাব ওঃ কিছুই ভাল্লাগছে না
সাহিত্য-ফাহিত্য লাথি মেরে চলে যাব শুভা
শুভা আমাকে তোমার তর্মুজ আঙরাখার ভেতর চলে যেতে দাও
চুর্মার অন্ধকারে জাফ্রান মশারির আলুলায়িত ছায়ায়
সমস্ত নোঙর তুলে নেবার পর শেষ নোঙর আমাকে ছেড়ে চলে যাচ্ছে
আর আমি পার্ছি না, অজস্র কাঁচ ভেঙে যাচ্ছে কর্টেক্সে
আমি জানি শুভা, যোনি মেলে ধরো, শান্তি দাও
প্রতিটি শিরা অশ্রুস্রোত বয়ে নিয়ে যাচ্ছে হৃদয়াভিগর্ভে
শাশ্বত অসুস্হতায় পচে যাচ্ছে মগজের সংক্রামক স্ফুলিঙ্গ
মা, তুমি আমায় কঙ্কালরূপে ভূমিষ্ঠ করলে না কেন ?
তাহলে আমি দুকোটি আলোকবষহ ঈশ্বরের পোঁদে চুমো খেতুম
কিন্তু কিছুই ভলো লাগছে না আমার কিচ্ছু ভালো লাগছে না
একাধিক চুমো খেলে আমার গা গুলোয়
ধর্ষণকালে নারীকে ভুলে গিয়ে শিল্পে ফিরে এসেছি কতদিন
কবিতার আদিত্যবর্ণা মূত্রাশয়ে
এসব কী হচ্ছে জানি না তবু বুকের মধ্যে ঘটে যাচ্ছে অহরহ
সব ভেঙে চুরমার করে দেব শালা
ছিন্নভিন্ন করে দেব তোমাদের পাঁজরাবদ্ধ উৎসব
শুভাকে হিঁচড়ে উঠিয়ে নিয়ে যাব আমার ক্ষুধায়
দিতেই হবে শুভাকে
ওঃ মলয়
কোল্কাতাকে আর্দ্র ও পিচ্ছিল বরাঙ্গের মিছিল মনে হচ্ছে আজ
কিন্তু আমাকে নিয়ে আমি কী কোর্বো বুঝতে পার্ছি না
আমার স্মৃতিশক্তি নষ্ট হয়ে যাচ্ছে
আমাকে মৃত্যুর দিকে যেতে দাও একা
আমাকে ধর্ষণ ও মরে যাওয়া শিখে নিতে হয়নি
প্রস্রাবের পর শেষ ফোঁটা ঝাড়ার দায়িত্ব আমায় শিখতে হয়নি
অন্ধকারে শুভার পাশে গিয়ে শুয়ে পড়া শিখতে হয়নি
শিখতে হয়নি নন্দিতার বুকের ওপর শুয়ে ফরাসি চামড়ার ব্যবহার
অথচ আমি চেয়েছিলুম আলেয়ার নতুন জবার মতো যোনির সুস্হতা
যোনোকেশরে কাঁচের টুকরোর মতন ঘামের সুস্হতা
আজ আমি মগজের শরণাপন্ন বিপর্যয়ের দিকে চলে এলুম
আমি বুঝতে পার্ছি না কী জন্যে আমি বেঁচে থাকতে চাইছি
আমার পূর্বপুরুষ লম্পট সাবর্ণচৌধুরীদের কথা আমি ভাবছি
আমাকে নতুন ও ভিন্নতর কিছু কোর্তে হবে
শুভার স্তনের ত্বকের মতো বিছানায় শেষবার ঘুমোতে দাও আমায়
জন্মমুহূর্তের তীব্রচ্ছটা সূর্যজখম মনে পড়ছে
আমি আমার নিজের মৃত্যু দেখে যেতে চাই
মলয় রায়চৌধুরীর প্রয়োজন পৃথিবীর ছিল না
তোমার তীব্র রূপালি য়ূটেরাসে ঘুমোতে দাও কিছুকাল শুভা
শান্তি দাও, শুভা শান্তি দাও
তোমার ঋতুস্রাবে ধুয়ে যেতে দাও আমার পাপতাড়িত কঙ্কাল
আমাকে তোমার গর্ভে আমারই শুক্র থেকে জন্ম নিতে দাও
আমার বাবা-মা আন্য হলেও কি আমি এরকম হতুম ?
সম্পূর্ণ ভিন্ন এক শুক্র থেকে মলয় ওর্ফে আমি হতে পার্তুম ?
আমার বাবার অন্য নারীর গর্ভে ঢুকেও কি মলয় হতুম ?
শুভা না থাকলে আমিও কি পেশাদার ভদ্রলোক হতুম মৃত ভায়ের মতন ?
ওঃ বলুক কেউ এসবের জবাবদিহি করুক
শুভা, ওঃ শুভা
তোমার সেলোফেন সতীচ্ছদের মধ্যে দিয়ে পৃথিবীটা দেখতে দাও আমায়
পুনরায় সবুজ তোশকের ওপর চলে এসো শুভা
যেমন ক্যাথোড রশ্মিকে তীক্ষ্ণধী চুম্বকের আঁচ মেরে তুলতে হয়
১৯৫৬ সালের সেই হেস্তনেস্তকারী চিঠি মনে পড়ছে
তখন ভাল্লুকের ছাল দিয়ে সাজানো হচ্ছিল তোমার ক্লিটোরিসের আশপাশ
পাঁজর নিকুচি করা ঝুরি তখন তোমার স্তনে নামছে
হুঁশাহুঁশহীন গাফিলতির বর্ত্মে স্ফীত হয়ে উঠছে নির্বোধ আত্মীয়তা
আ আ আ আ আ আ আ আ আ আঃ
মরে যাব কিনা বুঝতে পার্ছি না
তুল্কালাম হয়ে যাচ্ছে বুকের ভেতরকার সমগ্র অসহায়তায়
সব কিছু ভেঙে তছনছ করে দিয়ে যাব
শিল্পের জন্যে সক্কোলকে ভেঙে খান-খান করে দোব
কবিতার জন্যে আত্মহত্যা ছাড়া স্বাভাবিকতা নেই
শুভা
আমাকে তোমার লাবিয়া ম্যাজোরার স্মরণাতীত অসংযমে প্রবেশ কোর্তে দাও
দুঃখহীন আয়াসের অসম্ভাব্যতায় যেতে দাও
বেসামাল হৃদয়বত্তার স্বর্ণসবুজে
কেন আমি হারিয়ে যাইনি আমার মায়ের যোনিবর্ত্মে ?
কেন আমি পিতার আত্মমৈথুনের পর তাঁর পেচ্ছাপে বয়ে যাইনি ?
কেন আমি রজোস্রাবে মিশে যাইনি শ্লেষ্মায় ?
অথচ আমার নীচে চিত আধবোজা অবস্হায়
আরামগ্রহণকারিণী শুভাকে দেখে ভীষণ কষ্ট হয়েছে আমার
এরকম অসহায় চেহারা ফুটিয়েও নারী বিশ্বাসঘাতিনী হয়
আজ মনে হয় নারী ও শিল্পের মতো বিশ্বাসঘাতিনী কিছু নেই
এখন আমার হি২স্র হৃৎপিণ্ড অসম্ভব মৃত্যুর দিকে যাচ্ছে
মাটি ফুঁড়ে জলের ঘূর্ণি আমার গলা ওব্দি উঠে আসছে
আমি মরে যাব
ওঃ এসমস্ত কী ঘটছে আমার মধ্যে
আমি আমার হাত হাতের চেটো খুঁজে পাচ্ছি না
পায়জামায় শুকিয়ে-যাওয়া বীর্য থেকে ডানা মেলছে
৩০০০০০ শিশু উড়ে যাচ্ছে শুভার স্তনমণ্ডলীর দিকে
ঝাঁকে-ঝাঁকে ছুঁচ ছুটে যাচ্ছে রক্ত থেকে কবিতায়
এখন আমার জেদি ঠ্যাঙের চোরাচালান সেঁদোতে চাইছে
হিপ্নোটিক শব্দরাজ্য থেকে ফাঁসানো মৃত্যুভেদী যৌনপর্চুলায়
ঘর”
― Malay Roychoudhury, Selected Poems

“আমি এক সৌন্দর্য রাক্ষস


প্রজাপতির চিত্রল ডানা দেখে বিরহ থেকে বিবাহের দিকে
চলে যায় মানবসম্প্রদায় — আমি এক সৌন্দর্য রাক্ষস
ভেঙে দিয়েছি প্রজাপতির গন্ধসন্ধানী শুঁড়
আমার নিজের কোনো বিশ্বাস নেই কাউর ওপর
অলস বদ্মাস আমি মাঝে মাঝে বেশ্যার নাঙ হয়ে
জীবন যাপনের কথা ভাবি যখন মদের নেশা কেটে আসে
আর বন্ধুদের উল্লাস ইআর্কির ভেতর বসে টের পাই ব্যর্থ প্রেম
চেয়ে দেখি পূর্ণিমা চাঁদের ভেতর জ্বলন্ত চিতা
এখন আমি মর্গের ড্রয়ারে শুয়ে আছি এক মৃতদেহ
আমার জ্যান্ত শরীর নিয়ে চলে গেছে তার
শাঁখাভাঙা বিধবার ঋতুরক্ত ন্যাকড়ার কাছে
মর্গের ড্রয়ারে শুয়ে আছি — চিতাকাঠ শুয়ে আছে বৃক্ষের ভেতর
প্রেম নেই প্রসূতিসদনে নেই আসন্নপ্রসবা স্ত্রী
মর্গের ড্রয়ারে শুয়ে আছি
এ-ভাবেই রয়ে গেছি কেটে যায় দিন রাত বজ্রপাত অনাবৃষ্টি
কত বালিকার মসৃণ বুকে গজিয়ে উঠল মাংসঢিবি
কত কুমারীর গর্ভসঞ্চার গর্ভপাত — সত্যজিতের দেশ থেকে
লাভ ইন টোকিও চলে গ্যালো পূর্ব আফরিকায় — মার্কাস স্কোয়ারে
বঙ্গসংস্কৃতি ভারতসার্কাস রবীন্দ্রসদনে কবিসন্মিলন আর
বৈজয়ন্তীমালার নাচ হল — আমার ত হল না কিছু
কোনো উত্তরণ অবনতি কোনো
গণিকার বাথরুম থেকে প্রেমিকার বিছানার দিকে
আমার অনায়াস গতায়াত শেষ হয় নাই — আকাশগর্ভ
থেকে তাই ঝরে পড়ে নক্ষত্রের ছাই পৃথিবীর বুকের ওপর
তবু মর্গের ড্রয়ারে শুয়ে আছি এবং মৃতদেহ আমার জ্যান্ত শরীর নিয়ে
চলে গ্যাছে তার শাঁখাভাঙা বিধবার ঋতুরক্ত ন্যাকড়ার কাছে
প্রজাপতির চিত্রল ডানা দেখে বিরহ থেকে বিবাহের দিকে চলে যায় মানুষেরা
আমি এক সৌন্দর্য রাক্ষস ভেঙে দিয়েছি প্রজাপতির গন্ধসন্ধানী শুঁড়

“প্রতি রাত্র
আমার লগে বেইমানি করে ম্যায়ামানুষের লেহান
নিখুঁত
ম্যায়ামানুষের লগে
অহন আর কোনো সম্পক্ক নাই আমার
তবভি
পুরানা স্মৃতি
আমারে বারবার ছোবল মারতে থাকে
আমি তাগো ভালাবাসি
ভালবাসার গাঢ়ভাব না দেইহা।”

“আমারে মাইরা ফেলনের এউগা ষড়যন্ত্র হইসে
চারো কোনা দিয়া ফুসফুস আওয়াজ কানে আহে
ছাওয়াগুলান সইরা যায় হুমকে থিক্যা
অরাআমারে এক্কেরে শ্যায করতে সায়
আমি নিজের ডাকাইতে্যা হাতেরে লইয়া সচেত্তন আসি
কেউ আইয়া চ্যারায় দিশায় চ্যাবা কথা কয় না
আমি সুপসাপ থাকি
ভালাসির গুছাইয়া আমি কথা কইতে পারি না
২ কইতে গিয়া সাত হইয়া পড়ে
১৫ সাইলে ৯ আইয়া হাজির হব
ছ্যাব ফেলনের লাইগ্যা বিচড়াইতাসি অহন
আহ, আমার দাঁত মাজনের বুরুশ পাইতাসি না
বিশ্বাস করেন, কেউ একজনা আমার মুহের সকরা খাবার খাইসে ।”

“ঐ নিয়ন্তা হাতটির ইশারায়
বসেছি তখন সে-তটে
মৎস্য-শিকারে রত, পশ্চাতে বিরান তেপান্তর
আমার জমি কি নেব না গুছিয়ে আমি অন্ততঃ?
লন্ডন ব্রিজ ভেঙে প’ড়ে যায় ভেঙে প’ড়ে যায় ভেঙে প’ড়ে যায়
সে সেই অনলে লুকাল তাদের পুড়ে যা করবে শুদ্ধ অতঃপর
কবহুঁ ভইব দোয়েল-সমান—দোয়েল দোয়েল বোনটি
ভাঙা কেল­ায় আকিতেইনের রাজার কুমার কাঁদে
প্রলয় আমার ঠেকিয়েছি এই খোলামকুচির বাঁধে
তথাস্তু, হবে ব্যবস্থা তব। খেপেছে হিয়েরোনিমো পুনরায়।
দত্ত। দয়ধ্বম্। দাম্যত।

“There have been many times in my life where I would tell God that I need encouragement right now because of my rough day. God would then have someone call me, email me or text me something positive or uplifting. God does not run out of resources on how to bless you and make you happy. He does everything He can to make sure you know that He cares and He will show up for you.”
― Best Selling Author Sunshine Rodgers, God The Father Jesus The Big Brother Holy Spirit The Best Friend

“Most of us are too afraid to believe in a God who can part the Red Sea.”

“In the final analysis, the relation of the individual to society must not be conceived after the atomistic and mechanistic pattern of bourgeois individualism which destroys the organic social totality, or after the biological and animal pattern of the statist or racist totalitarian conception which swallows up the person, here reduced to a mere histological element of Behemoth or Leviathan, in the body of the state, or after the biological and industrial pattern of the Communistic conception which ordains the entire person, like a worker in the great human hive, to the proper work of the social whole. The relation of the individual to society must be conceived after an irreducibly human and specifically ethicosocial pattern, that is, personalist and communalist at the same time; the organization to be accomplished is one of liberties. But an organization of liberty is is unthinkable apart from the amoral realities of justice and civil amity, which, on the natural and temporal plane, correspond to what the Gospel calls brotherly love on the spiritual and supernatural plane. This brings us back to our considerations of the manner in which the paradox of social life is resolved in a progressive movement that will never be terminated here-below. There is a common work to be accomplished by the social whole as such. This whole, of which human person are the parts, is not ‘neutral’ but is itself committed and bound by a temporal vocation. Thus the persons are subordinated to this common work. Nevertheless, not only in the political order, is it essential to the common good to flow back upon the persons, but also in another order where that which is most profound in the person, its supra-temporal vocation and the goods connected with it, is a transcendent end, it is essential that society itself and its common work are indirectly subordinated. This follows from the fact that the principal value of the common work of society is the freedom of expansion of the person together with all the guarantees which this freedom implies and the diffusion of good that flows from it. In short, the political common good is a common good of human persons. And thus it turns out that, in subordinating oneself to this common work, by the grace of justice and amity, each one of us is trill subordinated to the good of persons, to the accomplishment of the personal life of others an, at the same time, to the interior dignity of ones own person. But for this solution to be practical, there must be full recognition in the city of the true nature of the common work and, at the same time, recognition also of the importance and political worth--so nicely perceived by Aristotle--of the virtue of amity.”
― Jacques Maritain, Person and the Common Good

“If you dispute something written in the bible you can’t plausibly claim to have ‘faith’ in that same God.”
― Gillian Dance, The Ultimate Religion

“As a diminutive woman I didn’t take any offense at all at sometimes being referred to as ‘the weaker vessel’, but Magali was almost comically enraged by it.”
― Gillian Dance, The Ultimate Religion

“I had to face a certain disappointment in God. This real God I had finally met was actually a man and favoured a man's world, discriminated against me.”
― Gillian Dance, The Ultimate Religion

“Part of the practice of modest faith, in times of suffering, is relinquishing our right to answers. God has never promised to explain himself, but he has promised to stay near. I will never leave, he says; I will never forsake. I am the friend that sticks closer than your brother. Do not think me unmoved by your grief. These are the faithful assurances of God as we have them in Scripture, and here is even more hope available to those willing to search it out. But let’s not be fooled to think that God has promised things like: it will get better, you’ll soon see the purpose behind this pain, there’s never more than you can handle. Often it does get better; often we do see purpose; always there is sufficient grace. But lament must practice the modest faith of finding sufficient that which God provides, even if, in seasons of great sorrow, it may not seem like enough.” …”

“No matter how hard you try to fit the pieces together, sometimes it's beyond your control, so sit back and trust in his plans.”

“You have to do all what you can, you never know what you are going to hear and where it is going to lead you.. Let’s do our best; it ignites my faith, at least, we are not just sitting in a corner waiting for a miracle, we ask the miracle to happen instead.”
― Noha Alaa El-Din, Norina Luciano

“I said all,
I did what is right!
God knows what happened..
God knows my intentions.
My conscience is clear, but
are they as fair as my conscience?
I put my trust and faith in God!”

“Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well.” At once the woman was made well. (Matthew 9:20-22) The woman was healed because Jesus Himself is healing.

She had faith in Him.

It is Christ who “dwells in our hearts through faith” (see Ephesians 3:17). He provides us with the strength, healing and wisdom that enables us to make ongoing healthy choices. In 2 Corinthians 12:9, God reminds us of His imparted strength: “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” We find it is not our own strength, but His strength that enables and empowers us."

“কেবল বাচ্চাদের বই পড়তে হবে।
কেবল বাচ্চাদের বই পড়তে হবে,
কেবল শিশুদের জিনিস ভালোবাসতে হবে,
বড়োদের সবকিছু ছুঁড়ে ফেলে দিতে হবে
দুঃখি চেহারা নিয়ে উঠে দাঁড়াবার পর ।
জীবন নিয়ে আমি অবসাদে মরে যাচ্ছি
এতে এমন কিছু নেই যা আমি চাই,
আর কোনো সুললিত জগত নেই ।
কাঠের এক মামুলি দোলনা ;
অন্ধকার, উঁচু দেবদারু গাছের,
অনেক দূরের বাগানে, দুলছে ;
যা মনে রেখেছে জ্বরে আক্রান্ত রক্ত ।”
― Osip Mandelstam, Complete Poetry Of Osip Emilevich Mandelstam

“As we grow older, it is our responsibility, as adults, to control our destiny - we are the masters of our faith, we are the captains of our souls.”

“বিক্রয়
ইল্যুমিনেশান ৪২
বন্ধকী কারবারিরা যা বিক্রি করেনি তা বিক্রয়ের জন্যে, আভিজাত্য ও অপরাধ যে অভিজ্ঞতা আস্বাদন করেনি, যা প্রেমের কাছে এবং জনসাধারণের নারকীয় সততার কাছে অজানা; তাকে সমসময় ও বিজ্ঞানের স্বীকৃতির প্রয়োজন নেই :
কন্ঠস্বরগুলোর পুনর্গঠন হয়েছে ; তাবৎ ঐকতানীয় ও সুরসংযোজিত কর্মচাঞ্চল্য এবং তাদের তাৎক্ষণিক প্রয়োগ ; উপলক্ষ, একক, আমাদের ইন্দ্রিয়কে মুক্ত করার জন্য !
দামের চেয়ে বেশি দরে দেহ বিক্রির জন্যে, অপরিচিত জাতির, জগতের, যৌনতার, কিংবা অধঃপতনের জন্য !
প্রতি পদক্ষেপে ধনদৌলতের উৎসার ! হীরের অবাধ বিক্রি !
জনগণকে বিক্রির জন্য নৈরাজ্য ; রসপণ্ডিতদের জন্য অদম্য আনন্দ ; প্রেমিক-প্রেমিকার জন্যে, অনুগতদের জন্যে নৃশংস মৃত্যু !
বিক্রির জন্য রয়েছে বসত এবং স্হানান্তর, খেলধুলা, নিখুঁত পুলক ও আরাম, এবং শব্দাবলী, প্রণোদন ও যে ভবিষ্যৎ তারা গড়ে তুলবে !
বিক্রির জন্যে রয়েছে শোনা যায়নি এমন গণনা ও ঐকতান-ধাবনের প্রয়োগ
আকস্মিকতা আবিষ্কার করে অভাবিত স্হিতিকাল, তার তাৎক্ষণিক মালিকানাসহ।
অদৃশ্য সমারোহ, অননুভবনীয় পরমানন্দের প্রতি আরণ্যক ও অশেষ আবেগ, সঙ্গে তাদের প্রতিটি পঙ্কিলতার জন্যে এবং ভিড়ের ভয়াবহ চালচলনের জন্যে পাগলকরা গোপনীয়তা।
বিক্রির জন্য রয়েছে দেহ, কন্ঠস্বর, প্রচুর প্রশ্নাতীত ধনদৌলত, সবকিছুই যা কখনই বিক্রির জন্যে নয় । বিক্রেতারা এখনও পর্যন্ত তাদের মাল শেষ করতে পারেনি ! বহুদিন পর্যন্ত দোকানদাররা তাদের বেতন দাবি করতে পারবে না !

“At the end of hope,
hold on a little longer.”
― Shweta Tale

“There can be no life without faith and love--faith in a human heart, love of a human being! That touch of grace, whose help once in life is the privilege of the most undeserving, flung open for him the portals of beyond, and in contemplating there the certitude immaterial and precious he forgot all the meaningless accidents of existence: the bliss of getting, the delight of enjoying; all the protean and enticing forms of the cupidity that rules a material world of foolish joys, of contemptible sorrows. Faith!--Love!--the undoubting, clear faith in the truth of a soul--the great tenderness, deep as the ocean, serene and eternal, like the infinite peace of space above the short tempests of the earth. It was what he had wanted all his life--but he understood it only then for the first time. It was through the pain of losing her that the knowledge had come. She had the gift! She had the gift! And in all the world she was the only human being that could surrender it to his immense desire.”
― Joseph Conrad, The Return

“What we need is not truths which will serve us, but a truth which we may serve.”
― RH Tawney

“The question of the religious significance of that change of emphasis, and of the validity of the intellectual processes by which Luther reached his conclusions, is one for theologians. Its effects on social theory were staggering. Since salvation is bestowed by the operation of grace in the heart and by that alone, the whole fabric of organized religion, which had mediated between the individual soul and its Maker--divinely commissioned hierarchy, systematized activities, corporate institutions--drops away, as the blasphemous trivialities of a religion of works. The medieval conception of the social order, which had regarded it as a highly articulated organism of members contributing in their different degrees to a spiritual purpose, was shattered and differences which had been distinctions within a larger unity were now set in irreconcilable antagonism to each other. Grace no longer completed nature: it was the antithesis of it. Man’s actions as a member of society were no longer the extension of his life as a child of God; they were its negation. Secular interests ceased to possess, even remotely, a religious significance; they might compete with religion, but they could not enrich it. Detailed rules of conduct-- a Christian casuistry--are needless or objectionable; the Christian has a sufficient guide in the Bible and in his own conscience. In one sense, the distinction between the secular and the religious life vanished. Monasticism was, so to speak, secularized; all men sood henceforward on the same footing towards God; and that advance, which contead the germ of all subsequent revolutions, was so enormous that all else seems insignificant. In another sense, the distinction became more profound than ever before. For, though all might be sanctified, it was their inner life alone which could partake of sanctification. The world was divided into good and evil, light and darkness, spirit and matter. The division between them was absolute; no human effort could span the chasm.”
― RH Tawney

“I've chosen fear over faith more times than I can count,' she admitted. 'And every time I did, I ended up with regrets.”

“It is the Will of Heaven, that the two Countries should be sundered forever. It may be the Will of Heaven that America shall suffer Calamities still more wasting and Distresses yet more dreadful. If this is to be the Case, it will have this good Effect, at least: it will inspire Us with many Virtues, which We have not, and correct many Errors, and Vices, which threaten to disturb, dishonor, and destroy Us. – The Furnace of Affliction produces Refinement, in States as well as Individuals…. But I must submit all my Hopes and Fears to an overruling Providence, in which, unfashionable as the Faith may be, I firmly believe.”
― John Adams

“সুতো ভুলে যায়,
বিভিন্ন সুতো আর ফোঁড়ের নকশাকে নির্দেশ দিতে গিয়ে স্মৃতি হারিয়ে ফ্যালে
দুই টুকরো হয়,
কেমন করে নাটাইয়ে পাক খেতে হবে তা না জেনেই ।
পোষ না মেনে, সুতোটা মেলে ধরে আর ঘন সাভানায় মোটা ছুরির ধারের মতন ঢুকে যায়, পেয়ারা পাতার ছবি আঁকা নির্দেশের বইতে, শান্ত ডাঁটিতে যা নিজের ভার না কমিয়ে শেকড় হয়ে যায়, ভিজে মাটি হবার ইচ্ছায় ।
তবু এটা তোমার বিষয়ে নয় যে আমি আলোচনা করব কিন্তু বধির আওয়াজ আমার মগজ ভরে তুলেছে আজ ।
কান থেকে কানে যতো আমি দূরে যাই ।
ক্রোধের ভুলো অনুসরণ ।
আর তুমি ঘুমোও । বাতাসের সঙ্গে তোমার শ্বাসের প্রতিদ্বন্দ্বীতায় তুমি ঘুমোও।
আমি নিজের মগজের ভেতর ছটফট করি ;
আমার এগোনোকে কিছুই স্তিমিত করতে পারে না ; কিছুই একে আলগা করতে পারে না।
আর আমি একমাত্র সেই শব্দ শুনি না যা একে থামাতে পারবে
কুমারীত্ব নাশ করা স্তব্ধতা।

( তুমি ঘুমোও ।
তুমি আমার শরীরের দেহরেখাকে আদর করার
ভান করো )
কান থেকে কানে।
কিছুই কান-থেকে-কানের নৈঃশব্দে ঢুকতে পারে না যা তোমার বধিরতার সবুজ আচ্ছাদন দিয়ে সুরক্ষিত ।”

“আমি আশার কথা বলব
আমি সেজার ভালেহোর মতন এই যন্ত্রণা সহ্য করি না । আমি শিল্পীর মতন যন্ত্রণা সহ্য করি না, মানুষের মতন, কিংবা নিছক জীবন্ত প্রাণীর মতন । আমি ক্যাথলিকের মতন এই যন্ত্রণা সহ্য করি না, একজন মুসলমানের মতন, কিংবা একজন নিরীশ্বরবাদীর মতন । আজকে আমি কেবল যন্ত্রণাভোগ করি । যদি আমার নাম সেজার ভালেহো না হতো, আমি এই একই যন্ত্রণায় ভুগতুম ।
আমি যদি শিল্পী না হতুম, আমি তবু যন্ত্রণা ভোগ করতুম ।: আমি যদি মানুষ না হতুম কিংবা জীবন্ত প্রাণীও না হতুম, তবু আমি যন্ত্রণা ভোগ করতুম । আমি যদি একজন ক্যাথলিক, একজন নিরীশ্বরবাদী, কিংবা একজন মুসলমান না হতুম, তবু আমি যন্ত্রণায় ভুগতুম । আজকে আমি আরও গভীর অন্তর থেকে যন্ত্রণা ভোগ করছি । আজকে আমি কেবল যন্ত্রণা ভোগ করছি।

কোনোও ব্যাখ্যা ছাড়াই আমি যন্ত্রণায় ভুগি । আমার যন্ত্রণা এতো গভীর যে তার কোনো কারণ কখনও ছিল না --- বা কারণহীনতা ছিল না । তার কি কারণ হতে পারে ? কোথায় সেই কোনওকিছু যে তার কারণ হওয়া থামিয়ে দিয়েছে ? কোনো কিছুই এর কারণ ছিল না । কেমন করে এই যন্ত্রণা নিজের থেকে নিজেই জন্মেছে ? আমার যন্ত্রণা উত্তরের বাতাস আর দক্ষিণের বাতাস থেকে, সেই যৌনতাহীন বিরল পাখিদের মতন যারা যৌনতাহীন ডিম পাড়ে আর বাতাস তাদের প্রসবে সাহায্য করে । যদি একজন প্রেমিকা মারা যেতো, আমার যন্ত্রণা একই হতো। যদি ওরা আমার গলার নলি কেটে দিতো, আমার যন্ত্রণা একই হতো। যদি জীবন -- সংক্ষেপে -- অন্যরকম হতো, আমার যন্ত্রণা একই হতো । আজকে আমি আরও ঊর্ধ থেকে যন্ত্রণা ভোগ করি। আজকে আমি কেবল যন্ত্রণা ভোগ করি ।

আমি ক্ষুধার্ত মানুষের যন্ত্রণার দিকে তাকাই আর দেখি যে তাদের ক্ষুধা আমার যন্ত্রণা থেকে অনেক পার্থক্য বজায় রেখেছে ; আমি মৃত্যু পর্যন্ত উপবাস করতে পারি আর অন্তত একটা ঘাসের শীষ আমার কবর থেকে জন্মাবে । প্রেমিক-প্রেমিকাদের ক্ষেত্রেও একই ব্যাপার । আমার তুলনায় তাদের রক্ত কতোটা স্পন্দিত হয়েছে, যার কোনও উৎস বা প্রয়োজন নেই ।

এতোকাল পর্যন্ত আমি ভাবতুম যে এই বিশ্বে সবকিছুই হয় বাবা-মা অথবা সন্তান । কিন্তু চেয়ে দ্যাখো : আজকে আমার যন্ত্রণা বাবা-মাও নয় সন্তানও নয় । অন্ধকার হবার মতো এর কোনো পিছন নেই, ভোর হবার মতো এর প্রচুর বুকের পাটা আছে ।, আর যদি ওরা একে কোনো অন্ধকার ঘরে বন্দি করে রাখে এ থেকে আলো বেরোবে না ; যদি ওরা একে কোনো উজ্বল ঘরে রাখে, এর কোনো ছায়া তৈরি হবে না । আজকে আমি যন্ত্রণা ভোগ করি তা যাইই হোক না কেন। আজকে আমি কেবল যন্ত্রণা ভোগ করি ।”

“As followers of Christ, we must respect God's creation of all people, and see them not as problems to be ignored or hidden away. Rather, we must see them as mirrors of our own brokenness, and as divine windows through which we can catch glimpses of God's grace. We must do whatever we can to respect God's image in even the most broken and twisted lives. Even the least of these carries intrinsic dignity and worth.”
― Michael Beates, Disability and the Gospel: How God Uses Our Brokenness to Display His Grace

“When we begin to do for the least of these what David did for Mephibosheth, and what Jesus called his followers to do, we discover this: we are the broken and the needy. They. Are. Us. Perhaps more openly and undeniably, but all the same, they remind us of our true state before God. That is the gift they bring to God's people.”
― Michael Beates, Disability and the Gospel: How God Uses Our Brokenness to Display His Grace

“Now that I was learning that converting to Christianity entailed a whole lot more than pats on the back and potluck lunches in affluent North Texas churches.

“Hear Joni Tada once again as she brings this idea home in a powerful manner: "You probably know at least a few disabled people. But did you ever think of the Lord Jesus in that category? No, he didn't have a physical disability, but he did handicap himself when he came to earth...Talk about handicaps! To b e God on one hand...yet to make yourself nothing. What a sever limitation! If you have a handicap, you're not in bad company. If anything, you're in an elite fellowship with Christ himself.”

“In Life, we have two choices after being heartbroken, we can become bitter or better. Always choose the latter!-Better”
― Bettye Nicole, Love Remains: "Grief From Life, Grief From Loss"

“If I let that which I hold to be true fall victim to a world that says it is not, I have in that action surrendered to the voices of those who know nothing of the truth other than to destroy it because it terrifies them. And if there’s one thing I should be terrified of it’s not the surrender itself, but the fact that in the surrender I have given the world permission to avoid the very thing that it should fear.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“If ‘what is’ defines my view of the world, then ‘what could be’ will become an ideal with no breath of life in it. Hence, I refuse to leave something so lofty without the ability to breath, for once it is breathing it will start running. And I can think of few things more electrifying as an ideal that is running over ‘what is’ as it is raising up ‘what will be.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“Joni Tada has said: "Not everyone can be trusted with suffering. Not everyone can endure a fiery ordeal. So the Master scrutinizes the jewels and carefully selects those which can bear the refining, the branches which can stand the knife. It is given for some to preach, for others to work, for others to give, and for still others to suffer. Where do you fit on the scale? He [God] has selected you to handle that particular, unique, individual set of circumstances in your own life. Not everyone could be trusted with what you're wrestling with, but you have been trusted. The grace is God's. The choice is yours.”

“Materialistic conceptions of the world and life, philosophies which do not recognize the spiritual and eternal element in man cannot escape error in their efforts to construct a truly human society because they cannot satisfy the requirements of the person, and, by that very fact, they cannot grasp the nature of society. Whoever recognizes this spiritual and eternal element in man, recognizes also the aspiration, immanent in the person, to transcend, by reason of that which is most sublime in it, the life and conditions of temporal societies.”

“Xavier would compare the land to his God, I knew, and His faithfulness and steadfast love. He would say how no matter what, God was always there. God had no mountains and valleys or storms and quakes. He could not erode or wash away. Eventually land would do that, I knew. But while I roamed the earth for my short life, I could rely on land to remain as it was. I could rely on God for all eternity. He never changed. He was the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow. And His faith never faltered, His trust never faded, and His love never failed.
But what I was unsure of was whether I believed in such amazing love and faith. If I believed that Someone so great could actually forgive someone so wretched. Xavier would tell me He would, if only I let Him. Yet how I would reply to that, I knew not either.”
― Grace A. Johnson, Held Captive

“He longed for a light that would teach him, forever and forever, and beyond all question, the way to go; for a power that would bind him, forever and forever, and beyond all crying, to the love of God... For it was time that filled his mind, time that was violent with the mysterious love of God”

“My soul is a witness for my Lord. There was an awful silence at the bottom of John's mind, a dreadful weight, a dreadful speculation.

“Ever since the rise of fear in the hominid psyche, one way or another, the grounds for an ever-active anti-fear mechanism was being prepared in the soft soil of consciousness by the process of natural selection. It is a process that deems survival potential as the only measure for existence. And by this measure, the anti-fear, anti-anxiety, anti-depressant mechanism, which later humans named "God", proved to be extremely effective. It delivered solace to the scared psyche of the early humans in their times of utter distress. In the midst of darkness, this one imaginative idea gave them light and hope.”

“Nothing irks a follower of the movement more than the next word: faith. The leaders have practically diagnosed it as the worst possible thing that a sapient creature can have, and yet we all cling to it in the end. We place our trust in people, places, things, both seen and unseen, and most of the time it has served us well as a species. Faith has been a cornerstone and foundation of our species, and other of the Hominidae taxonomy for millions of years. It is the foundation of good relationships, confidence, and even discerning wisdom and truth.”

“Placebo effect is where the drug causes greater effect and thereby faith accentuates, prolongs and promulgates the strength of the drug. Faith in an object that is known creates a strength in the object's reaction in a more powerful manner, provided the object was intended to create positive in the first place. Yet if this faith is turned inward in a negative manner, it can hinder the effectiveness of the drug or creative power of the thing being used for the positive, this is called the nocebo effect.”
― L.B. Ó Ceallaigh, The Bifrost and The Ark: Examining the Cult and Religion of New Atheism

“So, the first things we must do is decide which it is: A
substantive and hidden thing that produces cultural symptoms or it is the meme “hypothesis” and testable. If it is not falsifiable it cannot meet the criteria of scientific fact, according to the very structure of the scientific methodology itself. This would put it in the latter category of faith-based belief systems”
― L.B. Ó Ceallaigh, The Bifrost and The Ark: Examining the Cult and Religion of New Atheism

“On Him, on the Stone, is faith based, and on faith is reared up all the structure. For the habitation of the house is required pure fasting, and it is made firm by faith. There is also needed for it pure prayer, and through faith is it accepted. Necessary for it too is love, and with faithis it compounded. Furthermore alms are needed, and through faith are they given. He demands also meekness, and by faith is it adorned. He chooses too virginity, and by faith is it loved. He joins with himself holiness, and in faith is it planted. He cares also for wisdom, and through faith is it acquired. He desires also hospitality, and by faith does it abound. Requisite for Him also is simplicity, and with faith is it commingled. He demands patience also, and by faith is it perfected. He has respect also to long-suffering, and through faith is it acquired. He loves mourning also, and through faith is it manifested. He seeks also for purity, and by faith is it preserved. All these things does the faith demand that is based on the rock of the true Stone, that is Christ. These works are required for Christ the King, Who dwells in men that are built up in these works.”
― Aphraates the Persian Sage, Aphrahat Demonstrations

“Soar

And how can you soar
When you are so rooted to your pain?
The lessons of letting go, my love, are never made in vain.
Take what you need so you can navigate your way,
And let the rest go, with love and with faith.”
― Christine Evangelou, A Shore of Spiritual Shells: Poetry For Inner Strength And Faith

“We are; therefore I believe.”

“Truly, sacred rest is soul care. We honor quiet time alone with God. We intentionally step away from the chaos of life. We unplug from noise and distractions. We relish moments of tranquility.”
― Dana Arcuri, Sacred Wandering: Growing Your Faith In The Dark

“To be secure in one’s convictions is thus to be absurdly oxymoronic, since conviction is really a state of insecurity. If you know something for a fact, you have no need to believe it or to be convinced of it. You need belief only when you are not sure. Belief is thus the product not of knowledge, but of uncertainty. It contains within itself the possibility of disbelief. "Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto”
― Lesley Hazelton

“There is nothing restful about real faith. Where belief is the easy way out, a comfortable position for pious couch potatoes, faith demands an active engagement with uncertainty. “Doubt,” wrote playwright John Patrick Shanley in the introduction to his drama of that name, “requires more courage than conviction does, and more energy; because conviction is a resting place and doubt is infinite—it is a passionate exercise.” An exercise of the heart, that is, as much as of the mind—not of one against the other, but of the two interwoven, each constantly challenging and thus enriching the other.”
― Lesley Hazleton, Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto

“Active faith is having the wisdom to know that you can develop future knowledge to alleviate your currently incurable sickness.”

“Discovery comes from a lot of failures, knowledge, wisdom, faith, and a dose of craziness.”

“Our world says that seeing is believing, but for us to behold the deep glory of the cross, we must see as God sees rather than as man sees. We treasure what is invisible and that is perhaps the greatest source of the spectacle tension in this age and of the Christian life. The great spectacle of Christ crucified is a spectacle for the ear, not a spectacle for the eye. For faith comes not by seeing, but by hearing. p. 85”
― Tony Reinke, Competing Spectacles: Treasuring Christ in the Media Age

“I don't know about you, but I've gotten to the end of the day more than a few times and realized my untucked shirt was uneven at the bottom. I'm usually just one button off but sometimes two. The fact is, some of the people who have shaped my faith the most were a couple of buttons off on theirs. They've made some big mistakes. Run toward these people, not away. There is a quiet confidence in knowing we all hit a couple of wrong notes here and there. The report card on our faith is how we treat one another when we do.”
― Bob Goff, Everybody, Always: Becoming Love in a World Full of Setbacks and Difficult People

“I skipped a stone on the glass-like surface of a sleepy lake this morning. And I watched the ripples roll out from the stone’s impact until their energy abated and they fell smooth as was the rest of the lake. And as it become smooth again, I thought that one of the greatest things I could ask of God would be to grant me the gift of a soul with such inner calm that it would smooth out every ripple from every stone that Satan could ever throw into it.”

“The wilderness journey is about transformation. For you, it could be a personal, spiritual, or professional drought. A desert season of confusion, frustration, and unproductivity. It's an in between stage. Something significant has ended or begun. Yet it provides opportunity for expansion, wisdom, and joy.”
― Dana Arcuri, Sacred Wandering: Growing Your Faith In The Dark

“It's not always easy to admit that we can step out of the Lord's will when we want our own way. Yet, these are teachable moments to grow our faith in the dark. To live and learn. To be spiritually strengthened. To deepen our trust in Him, especially when His will and our will are opposite.”

“When we come to the end of ourselves, we find Jesus. When we come to Him in our brokenness, His grace is enough. Despite our free will, wrong turns, rebellion, poor choices, or going astray, Christ will never let us go. He leaves the ninety-nine sheep (His children) to find the one who's lost (us). And He carries us through the wilderness to do a mighty work within us.”

“हिन्दू जीवन-दर्शन के हिसाब से ईश्वर इस जग के कण-कण में विद्यमान हैं। ईश्वर की वास्तविकता तो सदा से ही बिल्कुल स्पष्ट, खुला तथा सरल रही है। वेदांत में किसी पाखंड, किसी चमत्कार और किसी भी विभ्रान्ति की कोई जगह कभी भी नही रही है। आप जब अहंकार रहित होकर, अपने स्वार्थ को तिलांजलि देकर निष्काम भाव से अपने आराध्य की प्रार्थना करते हैं तो स्वतः ही अपने भीतर सम्पूर्ण ब्रह्माण्ड को देखने लगते हैं। निरंतर प्रार्थना से आपको अपनी आत्मा की पूर्णता का ज्ञान होने लगता है। आपको आन्तरिक शान्ति प्राप्त होती है, हर प्रकार का मन का मैल धूल जाता है, आध्यात्मिक सम्पदा की वृद्धि होती है, आत्मबल बढ़ता है तथा आत्म-ज्ञान प्राप्त होता है। ईश्वर से विनती है कि आपके आस पास से दुर्बलता, अपर्याप्तता, व्याधि, रोग तथा शोक का दूषित वातावरण बिल्कुल खत्म हो जाये और धर्म, प्रेम तथा भाईचारा आपके चारो तरफ फैलता चला जाये। आपके घर में हमेशा उमंग, आनंद और सुख-समृद्धि बनी रहे।”
― Rajesh Goyal

“हमे दुबारा खुद को ये याद दिलाने की जरूरत है कि ईश्वर किसी सुख या दुख का वितरक नही है। और न ही वो सुख और दुख को निर्धारित करता है। ये सब तो हमारे खुद के कर्मों के संतुलन या असंतुलन का नतीजा हैं। इसलिये उस भावातीत ईश्वर की प्रार्थना किसी सुख को पाने या किसी दुख से छुटकारा पाने की लालसा से करना एकदम बेकार है। #प्रार्थना द्वारा तो केवल उस आनंद के स्रोत को खोजना है, जो पहले से ही मेरे, आपके और प्रकृति के भीतर सब जगह मौजूद है। उसी ईश्वर को अपने भीतर अनुभव कर के मन मस्तिष्क में शांति का अनुभव करना प्रार्थना है। सहज कर्मों से तथा स्वाभाविक रूप से उस ईश्वरीय अस्तित्व को धारण करना ही प्रार्थना है। ईश्वर कृपा से आने वाला प्रत्येक नया दिन आपके जीवन मे ख़ुशियों की नई सौगात लाये तथा आप पहले से अधिक स्वस्थ, प्रसन्नचित्त, आनंदित, प्रफुल्लित एवं ऊर्जावान हो जायें। आपके संसार में हर्षोल्लास का वातावरण सदैव बना रहे।”

“No matter what your wildest dreams of success, money, or great notoriety are? Nothing happens in a blink. It’s always series of events in our lives that bring us to these places we desire. So when you’re praying, wishing, or even daydreaming, on what you think will truly bring you happiness, remember the obstacles, people, places, along the way will not be left out. Pray, wish or daydream to be placed in situations that get you where you want to be. Pray for the right path.”

“Just like a common language is the key to communication of knowledge, a common faith is the key to living happily in a group as a family or friends.”
― Awdhesh Singh, Myths are Real, Reality is a Myth

“We don’t know if the mythologies are fact or fiction or mix of the two. But as far as people have faith in them, they shape their values. When people lose faith in scriptures and mythologies, they easily fall prey to the fictions of the modern times, which propagate infidelity, pleasure seeking and materialism.”
― Awdhesh Singh, Myths are Real, Reality is a Myth

“It is difficult to understand human beings as rational beings because even our rational mind is guided by our emotions. Emotions are the product of our beliefs which are based on faith without much logic and reason behind them.”
― Awdhesh Singh, Myths are Real, Reality is a Myth

“When you understand the language of the faith of another person, you can connect with him not only intellectually but also emotionally. A common faith builds relationships and binds people.”
― Awdhesh Singh, Myths are Real, Reality is a Myth

“It is important to have faith in life to connect to the fellow human beings as much as we need rational mind to understand the material world. It is unwise to drop all faiths just because faiths have been misused by some ignorant people. We have to see the positive impact of faiths and beliefs in the society and in the life of billions of people who are believers. Only by balancing our rational and faithful mind, we can find perfect life in this world.”
― Awdhesh Singh, Myths are Real, Reality is a Myth

“There are certain rules of logic that science has to adhere to, and there are good reasons for that; faith by contrast ignores all of that outright, preferring to believe whatever makes one happy. I want people to understand that accuracy and accountability actually matter, not just in academics but also as a point of integrity and honor and as a general rule in life.”
― Aron Ra, Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism

“This is what science always has to do, but religion will not do that. While scientists themselves may be religious individuals of many different faiths, their methodology was designed to be the antithesis of faith—it requires that all assumptions be questioned, that all proposed explanations be based on demonstrable evidence, and that all hypotheses be testable and potentially falsifiable. Blaming magic is never acceptable because miracles aren't explanations of any kind, and there has never been a single instance in history when assuming the supernatural has ever improved our understanding of everything. In fact, such excuses have only ever impeded our attempts at discovery.”
― Aron Ra, Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism

“Faith in action to me means going to the margins of society, seeking out those who are isolated, and bringing them back in. I was putting my faith into action when I went into the field and met the women who asked me about contraceptives. So, yes, there is a Church teaching about contraceptives—but there is another Church teaching, which is love of neighbor. When a woman who wants her children to thrive asks me for contraceptives, her plea puts these two Church teachings into conflict, and my conscience tells me to support the woman’s desire to keep her children alive. To me, that aligns with Christ’s teaching to love my neighbor.”
― Melinda Gates, The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World

“I don't have faith because life is good. My life is good because of my faith. I get knocked around, feel down and frustrated some days. But remaining that way is tiring and self defeating! You just have to know and believe that God (or your Higher Power) will not fail you. He is preparing you for greatness!”

“Sovereign LORD, your saving help is my shield.”
― Lailah Gifty Akita

“Lenin's analysis in The Development of Capitalism in Russia is a kind of profession de foi in a new and powerful idiom. To appeal to the intelligentsia, modern doctrines must combine faith and realism, or science, and Lenin's faith in the correctness of his "science" sustained him through lean years. The notion of faith raises the vexing issue of resemblances between Marxism and earlier Judeo-Christian traditions.

A rough human sense that there will be justice, that wrongs will be righted, that sufferings and humiliations will be revenged, that the rich will not enter either a heavenly kingdom or earthly socialist paradise, underlies a great many religious and secular doctrines, expressed in a variety of "sacred" and "scientific" idioms. Another common denominator of such doctrines is their identification of victims who are chosen to be saved and oppressors who are doomed, whether by God's love and justice or history's dialectic. Needless to say, this kind of hopeful and militant vision, when sustained over a long period of time, yields a history of struggle, frustration, adaptation, sectarianism, and defection. Like their religious predecessors, the new secular movements spread out over a spectrum of positions reflecting defeated expectations, changed historical conditions, and the psychologies of individuals creating the movements' doctrines and strategies.”

“O righteous One, never leave my side and never let me forget you, you are my only hope to succeed in this. Give me what I need to fulfill our will. My life without you is incomplete, you are my source of strength and abundance. I trust and acknowledge you. I am your chosen son.”

“The gods cared nothing for the fate of mortals, and those who prayed to them for benediction were no less fools than those who railed against them when the winds of fortune turned contrary. The truth was, people believed in divine stewardship because they wanted to believe the gods would protect them. Because it was safer to have faith in some higher order than it was to acknowledge the precariousness of their lives.”

“If the candles that I am lighting are those that I have so cleverly crafted, a thousand of them or more amassed together cannot dispel the darkness from which I am forever seeking refuge.

“When visitors come to a worship service in my own religious tradition, a great deal depends on how warmly they are welcomed and whether they feel included or excluded by what they hear during the short time they are with us.

I put my faith in fire.

Look past the thorn to how Christ is enough in the midst of it. His grace is sufficient for the thorn He chooses not to remove.”

“Love and faith are interconnected. If there is no faith, there can’t be any love. Even the most intimate love can’t withstand the onslaught of adultery, lying and cheating. Once you lose your love, it can never be brought back. If your beloved loses faith in you, it can never be restored.”

“I find the act of writing my thoughts out both frightening and healing. I am appalled at what is shackled in the depths of my heart, but I sense a release when it transfers from this inner depth of me to the page beneath my pen. My vision is beginning to clear and shrouded events are coming into alignment with some degree of clarity.

Now I need the courage to disclose my secrets and believe God will take care of me. No matter what the results are of the truth emerging, I want to trust He can use it for good in my life . . . somehow.”

“Remember!" she called, as she followed him up the narrow ladders towards the bridge. "It is only a matter of scale and experience. You are not a fraction of the whole.

“When you listen to a song you only hear the harmony because of the emptiness between notes. If the song is too full of notes, it becomes nothing but noise.

Maybe God knows that without His silences in our lives, we will never hear the melody of faith.”

“Protest is not a sign of rebellion or disconnection—at least, it shouldn’t be. Quite to the contrary, protest should demonstrate love and investment. It should be a sign that we are so invested that we are not willing to settle or surrender.

We protest because something or someone we care about is being hurt or diminished. Protest is not the action of an outsider or someone who is walking away. It is the responsibility of relationship—those who refuse to disconnect.”

“People are down on Evangelicalism these days, but even my earliest years of life showed me that Evangelical churches are great at doing a whole lot of important things. When an active member of an Evangelical church dies, the family of the departed receives immense support during their grieving. Dealing with the influx of casseroles and baked hams delivered to the homes of the bereaved can become a logistical issue, and their grass is mowed as if by elves.
What I'm saying is that it's easy to stand on the outside and dismiss Evangelicals as crazy Fundamentalists, but this misses most of what the movement really is (or, at least, is supposed to be). I'm not an Evangelical anymore, but it was Evangelicals who showed me how to...be a good employee and how to live my life with integrity. And Evangelicals were there for me when my life fell apart.”

“The church can never be the community of perfect, trouble-free people; the church cannot be a club of the moral elite. If the church is a church of the cross, of the Love of Father and Son, it cannot be the community of denial in positivity. How is it that the church has gotten the reputation for being a people where you need to be perfect to be part of it? Where you have to have your crap together to belong? It is the utter opposite; only those who are willing to admit that their crap is in utter disarray (even if it looks orderly) are those who can be in, and lead, the church.”
― Andrew Root, The Promise Of Despair: The Way Of The Cross As The Way Of The Church

“The only criterion necessary to belong to the church is to know impossibility, suffering, yearning, brokenness, and failure. Only those who have had such experiences (which is everyone) are welcome. For it is only through our loss, yearning, and brokenness that the suffering God of Jesus Christ encounters us, and it is only through these experiences that we can really be in relationship with others. A church that cannot admit it is filled with those who suffer is a community that cannot share relationship with others, for relationships that are rich and transformative are relationships built through our shared loss, yearning, and brokenness, through despair.”
― Andrew Root, The Promise Of Despair: The Way Of The Cross As The Way Of The Church

“Up against deep hurt, loss, yearning, and brokenness we are often thrust into silent loneliness.....The church often matters to so few people because the church has not been able to face reality. It has been the place of positive denial. But the church cannot be a place of love, the Love known through the crucified God, unless it is willing to abandon its hyperpositivity, abandon its need to be safe and clean, ad instead seek to wrestle in the dirty pathos of human yearning.”

“The lesson of acceptance is one of the hardest to learn. I've been working on it for quite a spell, and cannot yet rate myself as A or even B. To accept changes, slow or sudden, to accept the inevitable alterations in one's life, even in one's way of living or thinking, isn't easy; and to accept other people's inviolable right to opinions other than your own is hard, too.

To accept God's will, even if you do not understand it—and few of us do—is the most difficult, yet rewarding of all acceptances. Those of us who say the Lord's Prayer—formally at religious gatherings, aloud in a quiet room, or mentally to ourselves—rarely stop to think about each word and sentence or ponder on its strong core of inner meaning. To me the four words, Thy Will be done, are the most important; and they are valid in every creed.

Blind faith is something we've heard about as long as we remember. I do not think this is the ultimate in belief. Unless his small personal world has been shattered, the faith of a child in his parents and in his total security is blind until he begins to think for himself, at which point reason gives blind faith its sight. An adult's faith must be logical and based upon an immutable foundation, which gives him the capacity, when for him the world is shattered, to go a step beyond the bewildered child and accept loss or alteration.”

“Faith is always tested at the intersection of "Why?" and "Trust Me!" We come to God with those situations and problems that make us ask Him "Why?" He answers with a simple "Trust Me!" You cannot trust God in those things which you choose and not trust Him in others. You either trust Him with it all or with nothing at all. Your choice will either provide you with a powerful faith to carry you through the ups and downs of life or a faith that struggles with the slightest circumstance.”

“Christ said, not a single iota of the truth He gave was to be changed, then by what right do we sit in judgment on Divinity and say: This much of Your truth we will accept, because it pleases us, and this much we will reject? We are not the creators of divine truth; we are only the trustees and the guardians. God’s truths are not optional any more than the right to happiness is optional; they are not debatable any more than the multiplication table is debatable. Any sect which starts with the assumption that it has rights over God’s truth proves that it is man-made, and a religion that is man-made can be man-unmade. But a Church which is God-made cannot be man-unmade.”

“God’s angels are indifferent and apathetic. They have no feelings. They know nothing of passion, of love, of beauty, or even of justice. They understand nothing. They are the indoctrinated employees in God’s investment bank. They do nothing but praise themselves and each other and their boss and their company. Opportunistic cheaters and thieves of love and justice and beauty they are. Their CEO though, isn’t God but Satan. Though without a doubt on the surface it seems as if angels work for the Lord, and they love our God and praise Him, but secretly and really, they answer to the major shareholder, Lucifer. They bow to him unconditionally and without thought. They themselves, like the weak-willed who ought to have fallen, the sheep and the scorpions, lacked the courage and bravery to stand up to God when he founded the bank of existence. They agreed to the company policy but work secretly to overthrow it in disdain at their creator’s vision. The boldest and courageous of the angels is in fact Satan himself.”

“During the nine months I carried Cerian, God came close to me again unexpectedly, wild and beautiful, good and gracious. I touched his presence as I carried Cerian and as a result I realized that underneath all my other longings lay an aching desire for God himself and for his love. Cerian shamed my strength, and in her weakness and vulnerability, she showed me a way of intimacy. The beauty and completeness of her personhood nullified the value system to which I had subscribed for so long.”

“In my experience, those who make the most theatrical display of demanding 'proof' of God are also those least willing to undertake the specific kinds of mental and spiritual discipline that all the great religious traditions say are required to find God. If one is left unsatisfied by the logical arguments for belief in God, and instead insists upon some 'experimental' or 'empirical' demonstration, then one ought to be willing to attempt the sort of investigations necessary to achieve any sort of real certainty regarding a reality that is nothing less than the infinite coincidence of absolute being, consciousness, and bliss. In short, one must pray: not fitfully, not simply in the manner of a suppliant seeking aid or of a penitent seeking absolution but also according to the disciplines of infused contemplation, with real constancy of will and a patient openness to grace, suffering states of both dereliction and ecstasy with the equanimity of faith, hoping but not presuming, so as to find whether the spiritual journey, when followed in earnest, can disclose its own truthfulness and conduct one into communion with a dimension of reality beyond the ontological indigence of the physical. No one is obliged to make such an effort; but, unless one does, any demands one might make for evidence of the reality of God can safely be dismissed as disingenuous, and any arguments against belief in God that one might have the temerity to make to others can safely be ignored as vacuous.”

“When we lead with the values that inform our faith - compassion, forgiveness, and love - we enter into even the most emotionally charged discussions with a new perspective.

“Consider, finally, what it meant to Him to do this for us. “I go,” He says. Where is He going? He is going to the Garden of Gethsemane to sweat drops of blood. Where is He going? He is going to be arrested, to be tried in court, to be mocked and jeered and laughed at. He is going to be spat upon, to have His holy body scourged. He is going to have a crown of thorns placed upon His head. They will take Him and drive cruel nails into His blessed hands and feet. He is going to be nailed to a tree. Can you picture it happening to you, with nails being hammered in through hands and feet? That is what He is going to. And, too, He is going to endure the mockery and the spitting and the jeering of the cruel mob; they did not know who He was or what He was doing. He is going to die and to be laid in a grace, He who is the eternal Son of God through whom the world was made and by whom all things consist. He is going deliberately to all that because that is the only way whereby the door and the gate of heaven can be opened for us. “I go to prepare a place in heaven with God, a mansion for you.
Beloved friend, have you realised that the Lord Jesus Christ has done all that for you? If you see it, if you believe it, you will agree with Paul when he says that you are not your own, you “are bought with a price,” therefore you must give yourself and your life to Him (1 Cor. 6:20). If you believe Him, you can know for certain that He has prepared a place for you and will come again and received you unto Himself so that where He is, you shall be also.”
― D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, The Quiet Heart

“And—you can be very sure of this—all who belong to the Lord Jesus Christ; who have seen the all-importance of the soul; who have seen their dread condition under the condemnation of the law; who have believed in Christ and His sacrificial death; who have committed themselves to Him, taking upon themselves the scorn and sarcasm of the world; those who have counted all things loss for his sake, who have denied themselves and taken up their cross daily and followed Him; those who have said, “I care not what happens to me as long as all is well between me and Him”—these are they who will be with Him in the new heaven and the new earth and will share and enjoy His glory for ever and ever.”

“Much of what I’d done — mistakes, poems, manipulations, success and books and sex — had been done merely to get love. To get it. To answer my question: do you love me? . . . From that moment on, the love affair I would develop would be with my soul. [God] was already part of me; that much was clear. And now this would be where I would go for love — to the God in me. No more begging or pursuing or needing. Possibly it was only a myth, Jack’s myth [Til We Have Faces], that could have obliterated the false belief that I must pursue love in the outside world — in success, in acclaim, in performance, in a man.

The Truth: I was beloved of God.

Finally I could stop trying to force someone or something else to fill that role”
― Patti Callahan, Becoming Mrs. Lewis

“God does not want our faith kept in mothballs, so He sometimes allows trials and testing to come into our lives; the unexpected hardships and heartbreaks that rock us in places we never thought we'd face as a child of God.

“Benjamin Franklin said, "The way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason." I disagree. To truly believe Franklin's statement in the simple terms of the quote, not qualified in any capacity, I propose that you would actually have to be insane, particularly in the realm of extreme paranoia. For instance, to merely take a breath of air, one must have some measure of faith in the vast majority of normal circumstances. One must have the faith that there is not any invisible, odorless, & lethal substance that has gone airborne in your area. To eat or drink something prepared by others, such as at a restaurant, one must have the faith that no one has poisoned your food. You can certainly examine your food prior to eating it, but to run a countless number of tests to see if it is poisoned in a way that is undetectable by sight, scent, or taste is ridiculous on a daily basis. Regardless of your belief in God, gods, atheism, or agnosticism, to completely abstain from faith in life as we know it would make the movie "Bubble Boy" seem like child's play. No, Franklin misunderstands faith and in his error has put a box around reason whose exclusion of faith can't rationally exist in order to further try to justify self-determination of morality.

“In many ways, the aspect of the story of Christ that we both find so compelling and relatable is God’s choice to experience the discomforts of being human as a sign of his love for us. …
Living in community with other people … is uncomfortable. We have ideas that test each other. We have vigorous and painful disagreements. Rather than being discouraged, we can recognize our discomfort, ease into it, and share the experience of being human together.”

“We are of the earth very earthy, and we are not satisfied with contemplating the Invisible God. Somehow or other we want something which we can touch, something which we can see, something before which we can kneel down. It does not matter whether it is a book, or an empty stone building, or a stone building inhabited by numerous figures. A book will satisfy some, an empty building will satisfy some others, and many others will not be satisfied unless they see something inhabiting these empty buildings.”

“And when we talk about race today, with all the pain packed into that conversation, the Holy Spirit remains in the room, This doesn't mean the conversations aren't painful, aren't personal, aren't charged with emotion. But it does mean we can survive. We can survive honest discussions about slavery, about convict leasing, about stolen land, deportation, discrimination, and exclusion. We can identify the harmful politics of gerrymandering, voter suppression, criminal justice laws, and policies that disproportionately affect people of color negatively. And we can expose the actions of white flight, the real impact of all-white leadership, the racial disparity in wages, and opportunities for advancement. We can lament and mourn. We can be livid and enraged. We can be honest. We can tell the truth. We can trust that the Holy Spirit is here. We must.
For only by being truthful about how we got here can we begin to imagine another way.”

“As creativity becomes intertwined with our identity and livelihood, we forget its intrinsic value.

“Our creating is a part of the unfolding, generative process of God’s goodness filling the earth. Our desire to create is an imprint of the divine, designed into the fabric of our existence. Artists and creatives feel this acutely.”
― Alabaster Co.

“Many of our stories began in the secrecy of our bedrooms, strumming an instrument or writing in the pages of our journal. For others, it was the meditative practice of exploring the world through a clear glass lens or painting with our fingers. These quiet moments gave us a glimpse of the divine, a gut feeling that God was sharing our space. Or maybe creativity felt like a wrestling match with God – more an argument than a conversation – or even a tense confrontation with ourselves. Either way, as we engaged with Him, we were changed.”
― Alabaster Co.

“The call of the creative is the call to imagine an- other reality. Whether it’s by shedding light on the ways in which our current living falls short of God’s vision for humanity, or by articulating the possibilities of a shalom here on earth — the creative ultimately helps us locate ourselves within the larger story of God’s unfolding work in all of creation.”
― Alabaster Co.

“When we open the book of Psalms, we are opening the heart of what it means to be human.”

They show us how to speak of hope, loss, grief, victory, love, and failure — but more than that, the Psalms show us how to call out to the God who is present in all.”

“На мен ми разказа С., умен и честен човек, как той престанал да вярва. Вече на двадесет и шест години, при една нощувка по време на лов, по стар, още от детството наложен навик, се приготвил за вечерна молитва. Големият му брат, който е бил с него на лова, лежал на сеното и го гледал. Когато С. приключил и се приготвил да си ляга, неговият брат му казал: „Ти все още ли правиш това?”. И повече нищо не си казали един на друг. С. престанал от този ден да се моли и
да ходи на църква. И ето трийсет години не се моли, не се причестява и не ходи на църква. И не защото той е знаел убежденията на своя брат и се е присъединил към тях, не защото, той е решил нещо в своята душа, а само защото, думите, казани от брат му, са били като бутване с пръст в стена, която е била готова да падне от собствената си тежест; думите само са посочили това, че там, където е мислил, че има вяра, отдавна е празно и думите, които изрича, и кръстенето, и поклоните, които прави по време на молитвата, са сами по себе си безсмислени действия. Съзнавайки тяхната безсмисленост, той не можеше да продължава да ги прави.”

“Prayer is where I trade the rhetoric of men the for the promises of God. It is where I petition perfection instead of count on those who someone survived an election. It is to accept the incomprehensible invitation of God to have this weak voice of mine thunder down the halls of heaven and roll up to the throne of the God of all eternity so that as small as I am, I might have an audience with this “King of kings.” It is where my fatigue becomes a stage upon which God can unveil His strength in stunning fashion, and where my fear is obliterated by His courage. Prayer is where I rise above this tangled world and find myself enveloped by a world that I visit today, but will live in tomorrow. Prayer is utterly indispensable to this cringing existence, for unless I rise above it I will be consumed by the darkness of it. Prayer is this and does this and will always be this.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“I don’t fight battles by penning words or crafting syntax designed to bring people to tears by liberating their hearts or calling out their souls. Nor do I fight them by sitting with untold thousands and granting them counsel in the darkness of their darkest hours. No. Rather, I fight them prone on my knees in morning’s darkness before the sun has roused a wounded world awake to feel its pain yet again. I fight them throughout the day as I “pray without ceasing” because troubles befall us without ceasing. I fight them by praying for the impossible in lives devastated beyond redemption, for rogue nations that spread destruction as though destroying life was the answer to life, for the weak who stand teetering precariously on some emotional or relational or financial abyss, and for an impossible number of situations that everyone else has deemed as impossible. I fight in prayer. And despite the massive weaponry available to mankind, I am utterly convinced that a single man on his knees in humble petition before God exceeds the armament of all the world’s nations combined. This is what I believe. And therefore, this is how I fight.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“How do I tell you what prayer is? It is everything that I need every time I kneel in the practice of it. It shakes the infinite alive and sets its armies afoot in defense of me. It will never run aground or find itself drowning in the waters of the adversity that I bring to it. Nothing it faces is insurmountable, for to think that such an adversary exists is to run a fool’s errand. It will shield me in its advance, it will beckon me to anticipate the miracles that it is about to wield, and in the midst of it all it calms me as it whispers, “Be still and know that I am God.” And because of these reasons and a million more, I find prayer the single greatest place that I could ever imagine being.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“I am convinced beyond words to convey that prayer is infinitely more than the mindless ranting of some poor, delusional soul talking to some imaginary friend in some imaginary place. Oh, to the contrary. Prayer is the manifest pleading of a soul worn raw that, by the simple act of prayer, unleashes untold forces that we can’t imagine that surge in a descent so massive and so inconceivably powerful that the ground of everything before them shakes. And in this descent lives are changed beyond recognition, nations are transformed beyond comprehension, and history is brought to its knees in the face of a God who says “be healed.” That, my friend, is nothing of a delusional soul or imaginary friend or any other such nonsense.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“I cannot begin to tell you how many times I have come to prayer broken far beyond any conceivable hope of repair. I have likewise come without anywhere to turn simply because, much like myself, everything around me lies broken beyond repair. And I cannot tell you how many times God has taken that which is broken and has used it to do what could never have done should any of that had been whole.”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough

“Prayer is one of the few spiritual practices that is pointless unless God is real. Meditation calms the body whether or not there's a spiritual being receiving our deliberate breathing and clear mind. Reading sacred texts aligns us with the wisdom of our ancestors whether or not it was divinely inspired. Church attendance connects us to the needs of our community. Fasting cleanses the body of toxic substances. Resting on Sundays allows us to let go of stress and worry. But prayer? Taking time to pour out our needs and our anxieties, demanding change, confessing sin, crying out for help - all of these things depend upon the existence of God, and specifically the existence of a God who hears and responds to our cries. Prayer in the face of insurmountable problems is an admission of weakness and need. Prayer is a commitment to a better future, a sign of faith that the world will one day be made right. Prayer is an act that emerges out of helplessness. Prayer is an act of hope.”

“To such ignorance of God and His divine commandments were they brought down who were begotten of dust from the man of dust, that the honor which they ought to have rendered to God they gave instead to this visible creation, and not just to earth and sky and sun, moon and stars, fire and water and the rest, but they even made gods of those shameful passions themselves which ought not even to be imagined, let alone practiced, and which God had forbidden them. These they set up and – O, the shamelessness! – worshipped as gods. What were they? Fornication, adultery, homosexuality, murder, and whatever else is similar which, not God – away with the blasphemy! – but the devil enjoins and suggests and approves, by which the whole race of mankind was and is enslaved, by which the devil has made and makes us his slaves and subject to his control. Whence, even if there were someone among those thousands and tens of thousands who had not stooped to these shameful ordinances and precepts, since he, too, because of his descent from the seed of those who had sinned, was yet a slave of the tyrant, death, he would also be given over to its corruption and sent without mercy to hell. There was no one, you see, who was able to save and redeem him. For this very reason, therefore, God the Word Who had made us had pity on us and came down.”

“The sincerity of Darwin really admitted this; and that is how we came to use such a term as the Missing Link. But the dogmatism of Darwinians has been too strong for the agnosticism of Darwin; and men have insensibly fallen into turning this entirely negative term into a positive image. They talk of searching for the habits and habitat of the Missing Link; as if one were to talk of being on friendly terms with the gap in a narrative or the hole in an argument, of taking a walk with a non-sequitur or dining with an undistributed middle.”

“One day I was having lunch with two students who were talking about whatever they were talking about - the weather, the movies - when without warning one of them asked the other as naturally as he would have asked the time of day what God was doing in his life. If there is anything in this world I believe, it is that God is indeed doing all kinds of things in the lives of all of us including those who do not believe in God and would have nothing to do with him if they did, but in the part of the East where I live, if anybody were to ask a question like that, even among religious people the sky would fall, the walls would cave in, the grass would wither I think the very air would stop my mouth if I opened it to speak such words among just about any group of people I can think of in the East because their faith itself, if they happen to have any, is one of the secrets that they have kept so long that it might almost as well not exist. The result was that to find myself at Wheaton among people who, although they spoke about it in different words from mine and expressed it in their lives differently, not only believed in Christ and his Kingdom more or less as I did but were also not ashamed or embarrassed to say so was like finding something which, only when I tasted it, I realized I had been starving for for years.”

“Deep despair, dear Lord, deep despair
My heart yearns to be your heir
But my prayer remains unheard
Speak to me that I may hear
And I will know that you can hear
For I need to see you here!
Deep despair, dear Lord Jesus , deep despair !


Deep despair, dear Lord, deep despair
Your voice I wait to hear
Your presence I seek to be near
That I may not live with fear
And I will always be your heir
And never wander like the deer
Deep despair, dear Lord Jesus, deep despair!

Deep despair, dear Lord , deep despair
When expectations become desperation
May your might be my light
That I may see you as my guide
And do all things in your might
As I journey on with Thy light
Deep despair, dear Lord Jesus, deep despair !

Deep despair, dear Lord , deep despair
May I know who You really are
That I may know who I’m really are
As I stand between here and there
In a world that seeks to keep me here or there
So I may not be your heir
Deep despair, dear Lord Jesus, deep despair!

Deep despair, dear Lord, deep despair
When all hope is gone
And all otherwise thoughts have come
May I smile for what you have done
As You overcome condemnation with redemption
And provide all needs for glorification!
Deep despair, dear Lord Jesus, deep despair!”
― Ernest Agyemang Yeboah

“If I were to eliminate all of the things that I ‘want,’ I would be left with all of the things that I ‘need.’ And inevitably, such an action would leave me standing before God caught up in the stunning realization that in Him is everything that I ‘want’ and all that I ‘need.’ And how is it that I could not ‘need’ God and ‘want’ both?”

“He used to say, God is everywhere. In the work of your hands; in the beating of a bird's wings; in the roots of an oak and in the stones of the riverbed. In the rising of the sun. In the heart of a man. In the wonders we know, and those that are beyond our knowing.”

“Patience is a virtue they say. Faith is for the strong they say. But I say patience and faith are for the rebels. It takes radicalism to stare into eternity and not blink.”

“What you do in the Lord is not in vain. You are not oiling the wheels of a machine that's about to roll over a cliff. You are not restoring a great painting that's shortly going to be thrown on the fire. You are not planting rosed in a garden that's about to be dug up for a building site. You are -- strange though it may seem, almost as hard to believe as the resurrection itself -- accomplishing something that will become in due course part of God's new world. Every act of love, gratitude, and kindness; every work of art or music inspired by the love of God and delight in the beauty of his creation; every minute spent teaching a severely handicapped child to read or walk; every act of care and nurture, of comfort and support, for one's fellow human beings and for that matter one's fellow nonhuman creatures; and of course every prayer, all Spirit-led teaching, every deed that spreads the gospel, builds up the church, embraces and embodies holiness rather than corruption, and make the name of Jesus honored in the world -- all of this will find its way, through the resurrecting power of God, into the new creation that God will one day make.”

“For what accords better and more aptly with faith than to acknowledge ourselves divested of all virtue that we may be clothed by God, devoid of all goodness that we may be filled by him, the slaves of sin that he may give us freedom, blind that he may enlighten, lame that he may cure, and feeble that he may sustain us; to strip ourselves of all ground of glorying that he alone may shine forth glorious, and we be glorified in him?”

You will write me off. You will not give me my due. You will classify me a failure. You will say that I was a fool. You will call me mediocre. You will call me a man who had no talents. And all these are mere labels. Nothing will matter to me. But what will matter is that the children and grandchildren of the coming generations will read my words and get inspired to keep up their struggle. The struggle to chase your dreams. The struggle to never give up on your dreams! And I may be hailed as a hero by the next generation. That is all that will matter!”

“There can be no doubt that as a matter of fact a religious life, exclusively pursued, does tend to make the person exceptional and eccentric. I speak not now of your ordinary religious believer, who follows the conventional observances of his country, whether it be Buddhist, Christian, or Mohammedan. His religion has been made for him by others, communicated to him by tradition, determined to fixed forms by immitation, and retained by habit. It would profit us little to study this second-hand religious life. We must make search rather for the original experiences which were the pattern-setters to all this mass of suggested feeling and imitated conduct.”

“Our cultural conditioning is so ingrained in us that we often see these customs and taboos as inherent to the fabric of the cosmos. We spiritualize them. Legalize them. And when someone else doesn't follow them, it can feel to us like an attack on our very personhood. This kind of cultural blindness affects how we order creation.”
― Michael Gungor, The Crowd, The Critic And The Muse: A Book For Creators

“The guitarist is dependent on the guitar, which is dependent upon the creation, which is dependent on whatever creative forces or realities are responsible for its existence. If you call this creative force or reality "God," then art really could be thought of as the language God speaks.

“Let us be exhorted to exalt God alone, and ascribe to him all the glory of redemption. Let us endeavour to obtain, and increase in, a sensibleness of our great dependence, to have our eye on him alone, to mortify a self-dependent and self-righteous disposition. Man is naturally exceeding prone to exalt himself, and depend on his own power of goodness; as though from himself he must expect happiness. He is prone to have respect to enjoyments alien from God and his Spirit, as those in which happiness is to be found. But this doctrine should teach us to exalt God alone: as by trust and reliance, so by praise. Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord. Hath any man hope that he is converted, and sanctified, and that his mind is endowed with that true excellency and spiritual beauty? That his sins are forgiven, and he received into God’s favour, and exalted to the honour and blessedness of being his child, and an heir of eternal life? Let him give God all the glory; who alone makes him to differ from the worst of men in this world, or the most miserable of the damned in hell. Hath any man much comfort and strong hope of eternal life, let not his hope lift him up, but to dispose him the more to abase himself, to reflect on his own exceeding unworthiness of such a favour, and to exalt God alone. Is any man eminent in holiness, and abundant in good works, let him take nothing of the glory of it to himself, but ascribe it to him whose ‘workmanship we are, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.”
― Jonathan Edwards, God Glorified in Man's Dependence

“All human creativity depends on something deeper than itself.”

“One atom is capable of producing an atomic explosion that can unleash unfathomable destruction. What if this nearly infinite potential exists in everything?

Maybe this explains the full emotional potential of music. Perhaps a single note truly and completely heard would overwhelm us as completely as the voice of the Creator himself, entering our consciousness through processes of intricate complexity . . . the crafting of instruments, perfecting of skills, vibrating air and eardrum, nerves and synapses and understanding, and my God, it is all so magnificent!”
― Michael Gungor, The Crowd, The Critic And The Muse: A Book For Creators

“Faith has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with belief.”
― authormanojvaz.wordpress.com

“It is true that Christ makes a man anew, that there is some ultimate change in him. But part of that change is the ability to see your life as a whole, to feel the form and unity of it, to become a creature made for and assimilated into existence, rather than a desperate, fragmented man striving against existence or caught forever just outside of it.”
― Christian Wiman, My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer

“If God promises certain things to men upon certain conditions, then be strong in faith, knowing that God is right and anything to the contrary is wrong. It is only by faithfully taking God at His Word in all that He says, that faith will grow and become unwavering. When one achieves unwavering faith in what God says, he will receive unwavering answers to his prayers. But when man is double minded and changes his mind every few minutes about what he has asked of God, how can God decide whether the man really wants it or not? Under the circumstances God does not give it to him. When one doubts, he contradicts God's Word that promises him what he has prayed for, and such contradiction cuts him off from the answer.”

“...the Christian life requires a continual turning away from sin. But it also requires constant faith, for the Christian daily looks to Christ for loving care. The penitent believer never stops trusting in the saving power of the crucified and risen Saviour.”
― Philip Graham Ryken, The Message of Salvation: By God's Grace, for God's Glory

“Life tears us apart, but through those wounds, if we have tended them, love may enter us. It might be the live of someone you have lost. It may be the love of your own spirit for the self that at times you think you hate. However it comes though, in all these—of all these and yet more than they, so much more—there burns the abiding love of God. But if you find that you cannot believe in God, then do not worry yourself with it. No one can say what names or forms God might take, nor gauge the intensity of unbelief we may need to wake up our souls.”

“Some days are sweetened with pure, but fleeting joy. Just keep keeping on.
Some days consist of a kind of sorrow that tries to break you. Just keep keeping on.
Some days are filled with bright, warm light that clearly shows the path to follow. Just keep keeping on.
Some days are filled with calm and peace. Just keep keeping on.
Some days are filled with a violent commotion that does its best to disrupt our innermost harmony. Just keep keeping on.
Some days we must just take a rest, until we can once again, keep keeping on.
Some days are filled with hope and faith and the recognition of a journey we wouldn't trade for anything. And so we keep keeping on.”

“Sometimes it seems I can happily hold all Christian tenets in an active abeyance, a fusion of faith and skepticism that includes and transcends all literal and figurative truths, if I hold fast to one indestructible fact (FACT!?): Christ's resurrection. This event answers every impulse, fear, and need of my imagination, quiets and clarifies the raucous onslaught of time, suffers me—the mute, destitute, unselfed seed of being that is most me—to understand what suffering is, and what it means. But no. The reality wavers, the image fades like a reflection on the water, for under every assertion about God, including the one I am making at this very minute, the ground gives way, and once again I am left with the vital and futile truth that to live in faith is to live like the Jesus lizard, quick and nimble on the water into which a moment's pause would make it sink.”

“You'll be hard pressed to find any story in the Scriptures in which God becomes angry because someone has too much faith, too much determination, too much resolve. The truth is, we keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. God puts the bow and the arrows in our hands and tells us to shoot and to strike. And instead of pressing the limits of what God could do in and through our lives, we assume that his intention for us is less and so we settle fo what we can do rather than what God intended to do through us.”

“Any movement or sound is a profession of faith,
as the millstone grinding is explaining
how it believes in the river.
No metaphor can explain this,
but I cannot stop pointing to the beauty.

Every moment and place says,
Put this design in your carpet.

I want to be in such a passionate adoration
that my tent gets pitched against the sky.

Let the beloved come
and sit like a guard dog
in front of the tent.

When the ocean surges,
don't let me just hear it.
Let is splash inside my chest.”
― Rumi

“I give you this. Find your faith in each other. Look no further. The gods will war, and all that we do will remain beneath their notice. Stay low. Move quietly. Out of sight. We are ants in the grass, lizards among the rocks.’ She paused. ‘Somewhere, out there, you will find the purest essence of that philosophy. Perhaps in one person, perhaps in ten thousand. Looking to no other entity, no other force, no other will. Bound solely in comradeship, in loyalty honed absolute. Yet devoid of all arrogance. Wise in humility. And that one, or ten thousand, is on a path. Unerring, it readies itself, not to shake a fist at the heavens. But to lift a lone hand, a hand filled with tears.’ She found she was glaring at the giant reptiles. ‘You want a faith? You want someone or something to believe in? No, do not worship the one or the ten thousand. Worship the sacrifice they will make, for they make it in the name of compassion—the only cause worth fighting and dying for.”
― Steven Erikson, Dust of Dreams

“We hear a lot about evangelism today and how the church must pay more attention to evangelism. But mostly evangelism is not what we tell people, unless what we tell is totally consistent with who we are. It is who we are that is going to make the difference. It is who we are that is going to show the love that brought us all into being, that cares for us all, now, and forever. If we do not have love in our hearts, our words of love with have little meaning. If we do not truly enjoy our faith, nobody is going to catch the fire of enjoyment from us. If our lives are not totally centered on Christ, we will not be Christ-bearers for others, no matter how pious our words.”

They got up from the bank of stones. It was getting late, the shadows lay cool and lengthened on the grass and the tops of the trees had the stillness around them that means the end of the day and its liquidation in the setting sun.

“How can we, as Christians, stand firm when our faith is challenged intellectually? We can do this by learning to love the Lord our God with all our minds; by asking tough questions about God and the Bible and finding good, reasonable answers to those questions; by learning how to properly interpret the Bible in its context and according to its culture...and by understanding that all truth discovered by humans will ultimately reveal the creator of all truth.”

“A change of heart takes sometime,
Urgent haste will not make things better,
For it takes patience and time for a series of actions
The length of life is the same amount of your chances
Trust is never enough when it does not contain confidence
Faith is what you need, a prerequisite for hope and love
Heart doesn't really breaks, it is only a feeling
Painful but that is how the process of giving you a heart of a better shape!
Don't be trick by wrong saying or false advice,
Just pray and ask wise counsel to our LORD.

A gold ring will never looks beautiful if it wasn't burn, melted, struck and fashioned first.”
― Bradley B. Dalina

“Postmoderns will not swallow ideology just because someone said it tastes good. Cynicism is often their obstacle, but also it protects their hearts from further betrayal. They can sniff a sham a mile away.

Postmoderns...hunger for community and justice, humility and anticonsumerism. They don't like slick. They don't trust a leader without a limp. Since they question everything, they require safe spiritual environments where struggles are welcomed and discussed...They must be allowed to wrestle without being shamed, or they'll default to their open-armed peers and we will lose them.”

“Quello che Jared non sapeva, e che non volevo ammettere, era che io non avevo mai visto una lontra. Non dal vivo, almeno. Mi crogiolavo davanti ai documentari, con la voglia di portare mia sorella all'acquario, quando fosse nata. Le avrei indicato la vasca, sperando di ammirare le lontre che si tengono per mano, come avevo visto centinaia di volte in TV. E anche io l'avrei tenuta per mano, per non perderla, perché cosi fanno le lontre: non si perdono.”
― Chiara Panzuti, Absence. L'altro volto del cielo

“Termed variously as "secularization," "religious disenchantment" or "modernism," this movement has given rise to an essentially new form of consciousness. It has construed knowledge as empirically demonstrable facts; it has subordinated ethics and aesthetics to what works or is workable; it has reduced intimacy to sexuality and inflated sexuality to fetishism. It has come to see faith as belief or a belief system and, in what passes for tolerance or "understanding," maintains a dogmatic attitude of relativism regarding the truth or appropriateness of all such "systems of belief.”
― James W. Fowler

“God never promised we wouldn’t know pain. He isn’t the author of it, but He isn’t the bodyguard blocking it from us, either. Jesus Himself knew intense, agonizing pain. The worst kind, as a matter of fact. Betrayal. False accusations. A humiliating death on a cross for a crime He didn’t commit. No, God never promised us we wouldn’t know pain. That we wouldn’t know Ground Zero moments and dark nights of the soul. What He DID promise was to be with us in the midst of our pain.”
― Mandy Hale, You Are Enough: Heartbreak, Healing, and Becoming Whole

― Akiroq Brost

“But if you are not careful, spirituality can quite easily allow you to bypass the human dilemma, because spirituality can be anything you want it to be, whereas faith will challenge you. It’s not so comfortable. It carries with it the undeniable tension between your search for security and the limits of your ability to know. Faith keeps your spiritual quest relevant and connected to the heart of the human predicament.”
― Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel, The Logic of Faith: A Buddhist Approach to Finding Certainty Beyond Belief and Doubt

“The initial function of spirituality emerged from questioning the human condition and also from deep experiences of wonder. The word religion itself, initially meaning to “reconnect,” seems to have come from direct experiences of something larger than just a set of fixed ideas. It marked a return to something essential that we just failed to recognize in the myopia of our everyday lives. How curious that we turn experiences of awe into dogmas and stagnant ideas. That we have come to associate faith with fundamentalism, blindness, and even terrorism gives us something important to look at.”
― Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel, The Logic of Faith: A Buddhist Approach to Finding Certainty Beyond Belief and Doubt
