after all i believe that legends and myths are largely made of truth and indeed present aspects of it that can only be received in this mode and long ago certain truths and modes of this kind were discovered and must always reappear

when one experiences truth the madness of finding fault with others disappears

now you know how badly someone wanted you charley children forget that sometimes they think of themselves as a burden instead of a wish granted

you cant just like harry potter you have to be ballsout obsessed with it

the hidden wellspring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea

and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes

but let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure

and seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line

for self is a sea boundless and measureless

say not i have found the truth but rather i have found a truth

say not i have found the path of the soul say rather i have met the soul walking upon my path

for the soul walks upon all paths

the soul walks not upon a line neither does it grow like a reed

the soul unfolds itself like a lotus of countless petals

because i was dying

and then i took it all back because i was scared and confused and conflicted because of adam

warner told me he loved me and in return i insulted him and lied to him and yelled at him and pushed him away and when he had the chance to stand back and watch me die he didn’t

he found a way to save my life

with no demands no expectations believing full well that i was in love with someone else and that saving my life meant making me whole again only to give me back to another guy

and right now i can’t say i know what adam would do if i were dying in front of him i’m not sure if he would save my life and that uncertainty alone makes me certain that something wasnt right between us

if a man has so much heat he burns your skin when he touches you hes the devil run away

young people mcdonald said contemptuously you always think theres something to find out

no andrews said a vague terror crept from the darkness that surrounded them and tightened his voice thats not the way it is

ergo girls should always make the first move because a they are on the whole less likely to be rejected than guys b that way girls will never get kissed unless they want to be kissed

you have to be the prude or the slut and if you pick one other people hate you for it and you can’t trust anyone anymore because they’re all after the same thing and you see that you can never go back to how was before…

news flash bozo dont ever tell a girl to relax it only makes us madder

then it melts

the bus drivers rev their engines and the ice cloud shatters everyone shuffles forward they dont know what just happened they cant remember

it’s not unpatriotic to denounce an injustice committed on our behalf perhaps it’s the most patriotic thing we can do

people resist a census but give them a profile page and theyll spend all day telling you who they are

yes i want money more than anything else in the world

then you’ve made the only choice but there’s a penalty attached as there is to most things you want it’s loneliness

it is not the possession of truth but the success which attends the seeking after it that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him

you know the games i play

and the words i say

when i want my own way

you know the lies i tell

when youve gone through hell

and i say i cant stay

you know how hard it can be

to keep believing in me

when everything and everyone

becomes my enemy and when

theres nothing more you can do

im gonna blame it on you

its not the way i want to be

i only hope that in the end you will see

its the opheliac in me

ive always liked the moonless night best its easier to say things in the dark its easier to be yourself

i have a theory that as long as you have one good friend one real friend you can get through anything

martha truth or illusion george you dont know the difference

george no but we must carry on as though we did

there are times when wisdom cannot be found in the chambers of parliament or the halls of academia but at the unpretentious setting of the kitchen table

scepticism is the first step towards truth

i just think if you dont say the honest thing sometimes the honest thing never becomes true you know and i

i dont go out of my way to make friends thats all

the gift of truth excels all other gifts

the aim of science is to discover and illuminate truth and that i take it is the aim of literature whether biography or history it seems to me then that there can be no separate literature of science

to crooked eyes truth may wear a wry face

kant thought things not because they were true but because he was kant

to know the history of science is to recognize the mortality of any claim to universal truth

lies dont end relationships the truth does

for those who like that sort of thing said miss brodie in her best edinburgh voice that is the sort of thing they like

some bitter boys reading this might accuse me of friendzoning but i’d like to say that even if a girl has misinterpreted a situation that someone else thinks was obvious she does not owe her male friends anything

but i still feel like i lost

id rather hear an ugly truth rather than an obscure lie

antonin artaud wrote on one of his drawings never real and always true and that is how depression feels you know that it is not real that you are someone else and yet you know that it is absolutely true

therefore since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us be thankful and so worship god acceptably with reverence and awe for our god is a consuming fire

the poets job is to put into words those feelings we all have that are so deep so important and yet so difficult to name to tell the truth in such a beautiful way that people cannot live without it

be wise today so you dont cry tomorrow

what more could you want how about dominion over this beautiful place beauty doesnt last friends and family decay power is the only thing that goes on forever

jack answered with his gut no love goes on forever

michael theres nothing here to fear

lucifer well theres always the truth

why do people respect the package rather than the man

love without truth is sentimentality it supports and affirms us but keeps us in denial about our flaws truth without love is harshness it gives us information but in such a way that we cannot really hear it

the first splendid truth to be happy i need to think about feeling good feeling bad and feeling right in an atmosphere of growth

they dispute not in order to find or even to seek truth but for victory and to appear the more learned and strenuous upholders of a contrary opinion such persons should be avoided by all who have not a good breastplate of patience

a need for revenge can burn long and hot especially if every glance in a mirror reinforces it

status will get you nowhere only an open heart will allow you to float equally between everyone

one could argue that its romantic to die for love of course then youre dead and unable to take that honeymoon trip to the alps with all the other fashionable young couples which is a shame

if we didnt fear the truths we didnt hear wed lose the need to fear the ones we did

it is error alone which needs the support of government truth can stand by itself

people tend to look on the beliefs of the past as being primitive and unintelligent yet we are seeing more truth in the past every day

without balance a life is no longer worth the effort

i like you he said

he made it sound as if she was bound to disagree with him she nodded his face said he was telling her something very important

he said i mean it whatever happens you have to believe that

judging is preventing us from understanding a new truth free yourself from the rules of old judgments and create the space for new understanding

because even though the truth can set you free that doesnt mean it wont be painful

there is no truth except the truth that exists within you everything else is what someone is telling you

yes my lord but questions are dangerous for they have answers

in wine theres truth

its funny whom we end up choosing to love and who ends up choosing to love us its rarely the people we think it should be

he looked at me intently from what seemed behind the veil of a grave experience then slowly and prophetically he said the scariest thing id ever heard because the answer to a heartfelt question jack will always break your heart

those who understand history are condemned to watch other idiots repeat it

i have no name she purred im whoever the keepers of my fate tell me to be

she was a beautiful savage

the truth is the kindest thing we can give folks in the end

dont live by my words dont die by them chew them slowly digest them and smile if they give nourishment to your soul

i don’t think there’s anything wrong with telling the truth i know it isn’t fashionable

i think my quarry is illusion i war against magic i believe that though illusion often cheers and comforts it ultimately and invariably weakens and constricts the spirit

you dont destroy what you want to

acquire in the future

we do not have to be mental health professionals to identify the traits of the possible sociopaths among us

the first casualty when war comes is truth

lifes trials will test you and shape you but don’t let them change who you are

all you know is what you think you know but that isnt always whats real

the person you hurt the most in this world was the person that brought you into it

an opinion should be the result of thought not a substitute for it

what you choose also chooses you

the ordinary response to atrocities is to banish them from consciousness certain violations of the social compact are too terrible to utter aloud this is the meaning of the word unspeakable

to hate others is ugly

to hate yourself is uglier

the distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success

people always say life is too short for regrets but the truth is its too long

my son ﻿do not forget my teaching

but let your heart ﻿keep my commandments

for ﻿length of days and years of life

and peace they will add to you

so you will ﻿find favor and good repute

in the sight of god and man

trust in the lord with all your heart

and ﻿do not lean on your own understanding

in all your ways ﻿acknowledge him

and he will ﻿make your paths straight

if you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor

reply to the diet of worms april

why did adults have to be so thick they always say tell the truth and when you do they don’t believe you what’s the point

the trouble with denial is that when the truth comes you arent ready

but love is much like a dam if you allow a tiny crack to form through which

nonviolence which is the quality of the heart cannot come by an appeal to the brain

when i tell the truth it is not for the sake of convincing those who do not know it but for the sake of defending those that do

the universe doesnt like secrets it conspires to reveal the truth to lead you to it

oh what is brighter than the light

what is darker than the night

what is keener than an axe

what is softer than melting wax

truth is brighter than the light

falsehood darker than the night

revenge is keener than an axe

and love is softer than melting wax

over time hidden truths morph in the dark soil of deceit into something much worse

our kindness may be the most persuasive argument for that which we believe

i shouldnt believe anything i say if i were youand that includes what i just told you

only by examining our personal biases can we grow as artists only by cultivating empathy can we grow as people

people are basically irritating myself included

theres nothing wrong with stretching the truth we stretch taffy and that just makes it more delicious

for people who say they hate being lied to just start telling them nothing but the pure truthabout everything that will teach them

there is no such thing as your truth there is the truth and your opinion

they dont actually want you to do your own thing not unless its their thing too

when a man has a gift in speaking the truth brute aggression is no longer his security blanket for approval he on the contrary spends most of his energy trying to tone it down because his very nature is already offensive enough

i feel strangely free at such times to behave properly is to be always courteous always clever and subtle and elegant but now when i am so alone i do not have to be any of these things

for this moment i am wholly myself unshaped by the needs of others by their dreams or expectations or sensibilities

but i am also lonely with no one to shape me who stands here watching the moon or the stars or the clouds

our idea of god tells us more about ourselves than about him

be a light unto the world and hurt it not seek to build not destroy bring my people home

how

by your shining example seek only godliness speak only in truthfulness act only in love

live the law of love now and forever more give everything require nothing

avoid the mundane

do not accept the unacceptable

teach all who seek to learn of me

make every moment of your life an outpouring of love

use every moment to think the highest thought say the highest word do the highest deed in this glorify your holy self and thus too glorify me

bring peace to the earth by bringing peace to all those whose lives you touch be peace feel and express in every moment your divine connection with the all and with every person place and thing

love does not cost anything kind words and deeds do not cost anything the real beauty of the world is equal for everyone to see it was given by god equally to all without restrictions

everyone was given a beautiful vehicle in which to express love to others feelings are free to express and give to ourselves and each other through our willingness to give and care

what is complicated about this why have we made others feel they have to climb mountains and swim oceans in order to make a difference

all we need to understand my friends is that human life was given equally to us all not partially but in totality

in all debates let truth be thy aim not victory or an unjust interest

in the end your past is not my past and your truth is not my truth and your solution  is not my solution

its only words unless theyre true

i dont play with my life by talking bullshit

i might have some chances in this bitchy life

but ive got only one fuckin chance to give

my best shot

language always betrays us tells the truth when we want to lie and dissolves into formlessness when we would most like to be precise

why do you so earnestly seek

the truth in distant places

look for delusion and truth in the

bottom of your own heart

but my memories are like a fire in winter—whenever im cold i can warm my hands at them

you cant let the truth bring out the worst and let it get the best of you

truth at last cannot be hidden dissimulation is of no avail dissimulation is to no purpose before so great a judge falsehood puts on a mask nothing is hidden under the sun

the truth is more important than the facts

i really am happy for kiley and for you and every other happily married lady except for that im not happy for you i kind of want you all to drop dead

imagine you come upon a house painted brown what color would you say the house was

why brown of course

but what if i came upon it from the other side and found it to be white

that would be absurd who would paint a house two colors

he ignored my question you say its brown and i say its white whos right

were both right

non he said were both wrong the house isnt brown or white its both you and i only see one side but that doesnt mean the other side doesnt exist to not see the whole is to not see the truth

this is what comes of having a heart even a very small and young one it causes no end of trouble and that’s the truth

the truth has always been a more complex commodity than the market can easily package and sell

no one dies of fatal truths nowadays there are too many antidotes

mothers were the only ones you could depend on to tell the whole unvarnished truth

nothing in the world is harder than convincing someone of an unfamiliar truth

at times theres something so precise and mathematically chilling about nationalism

build a dam to take away water away from  million people build a dam to pretend to bring water to  million people who are these gods that govern us is there no limit to their powers

theyre so broke that theyve actually cut essential services in many places theyve cut policemen because who the fuck needs them or firemen son of a bitch its much more fun watching something burn down

those who are enslaved to their sects are not merely devoid of all sound knowledge but they will not even stop to learn

and yet sometimes facts are no more than pitiful consequences because guilt does not reside in our acts but in the intentions that give rise to our act everything turns on our intentions

in this treacherous world

nothing is the truth nor a lie

everything depends on the color

of the crystal through which one sees it

to love someone with all of your heart requires reaching them where they are with the only words they can understand

my mom said i was an escapist at heart that i preferred imaginary worlds to the real one

what is important is not what you hear said its what you observe

but the truth doesnt need to be known or believed to be true

there is no truth on this island of yours rather there are as many truths as there are stars in the sky and every one of them different

inside each of us resides the truth i began the absolute truth but sometimes the truth is hidden in a hall of mirrors sometimes we believe we are viewing the real thing when in fact we are viewing a facsimile a distortion

it takes two to speak the truth  one to speak and another to hear

one but many

we are all one

but many

fiction just makes it all more interesting truth is so boring

truth freedom justice and a hardboiled egg

theres release in knowing the truth no matter how anguishing it is you come finally to the irreducible thing and theres nothing left to do but pick it up and hold it then at last you can enter the severe mercy of acceptance

turgenev was a very serious fellow but he could make me laugh because a truth first encountered can be very funny when someone elses truth is the same as your truth and he seems to be saying it just for you thats great

the truth comes to me the truth loves me

the truth is seldom welcome especially at dinner

if you feel obsessed to prove something to the world

then youd need world attention to be able to prove it

as you see the opening get closer you just cant get fast enough and finally just when you think youll never get there you see the opening right in front of you

the truth between two people always cuts two ways

contentment and happiness didnt exist in my life for more than a few moments at a time and they were really only illusionary there was always something hidden lying in wait to spring up and ruin everything

its in those quiet little towns at the edge of the world that you will find the salt of the earth people who make you feel right at home

god existed before every religion he exists in spite of all religions

the human person finds his perfection in seeking and loving what is true and good

leowin dont worry luthiel truths existence never depended upon belief

for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost i am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it

i only feel like myself when i am alone

accidents happen our bones shatter our skin splits our hearts break we burn we drown we stay alive

ive heard it said that god is in the details its the same with the truth leave out the details the crucial heart and you can damn someone with the bare bones of it

no amount of me trying to explain myself was doing any good i didnt even know what was going on inside of me so how could i have explained it to them

the truth is found when men and women are free to pursue it

its one thing to think youre worthless and quite another for somebody else to tell you that you are

it is a time of change sazed said perhaps it is also time to learn of other truths other ways

all the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over news

in western civilization our elders are books

one of the few things in life that cannot possibly do harm in the end is the honest pursuit of the truth

all i could say was i dont know what to do i remember her taking me by the shoulders and looking me in the eye with a calm smile and saying simply tell the truth tell the truth tell the truth

grief no matter how you try to cater to its wail has a way of fading away

the ego lusts for satisfaction it has a prideful ferocious appetite for its version of truth it is the most challenging aspect to conquer the cause for most spiritual turmoil

emotional states are fairly quick bursts of neuronal gossip traits on the other hand are more like the neuronal equivalent of committed relationships

but just because you love something i added to myself doesnt mean youll ever be great not if you dont work most people stink at the things they love

the past cannot be changed the future is yet in your power

for my true thoughts have spent more time in your company than in anyone elses these last two or three months and where my thoughts are there am i in truth

i ought to go upright and vital and speak the rude truth in all ways

you can tell people the truth but theyll never believe you until the event in the meantime the truth will just piss them off and get you in a lot of trouble

lies have expiry dates but the truth never expires

i am looking for the one i can’t fool

the truth cuts like the sharpest knife ive ever known

dont be afraid to be afraid

have fear and then conquer the

shit out of it

because the truth is it isnt worth loving something if you arent going to love it all the way

you cant make a fan of everyone stay true to your story characters music art or whatever it is you do and fuck everyone else who doesnt like it life isnt perfect

protects itself

irrational and blind

or fear looms

defiant and closed

protects itself

and protected

we cannot decide to love we cannot compel anyone to love us theres no secret recipe only love itself and we are at its mercytheres nothing we can do

it is impossible to enslave mentally or socially a biblereading people the principles of the bible are the groundwork of human freedom

if her life had taught her anything it was that you never really knew what people had going on beneath the surface people were shit the only difference between them and animals was people felt the need to hide it

were all pieces of the same everchanging puzzle

some connected for mere seconds some connected for life

some connected through knowledge some through belief

tell the truth through whichever veil comes to hand – but tell it resign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never ­being satisfied

chaos is more freedom in fact total freedom but no meaning

stop lying to yourself when we deny our own truth we deny our own potential

and yet a woman

and transforming it into triumph

a thousand times i was ready to regret and take back my rash statement  yet it had been the truth

i can be forced to live without happiness but i will never consent to live without honor

featherweight by suzy kassem

i sat by the ocean and questioned the moon about my destiny

i revealed to it that i was beginning to feel smaller compared to others

because the more secrets of the universe i would unlock

the smaller in size i became

i didnt understand why i wasnt feeling larger instead of smaller

i thought that seeking truth was what was required of us all –

to show us the way not to make us feel lost

up against the odds

in a devilish game partitioned by

an invisible wall

then the next morning

a bird appeared at my window just as the sun began

spreading its yolk over the horizon

it remained perched for a long time

gazing at me intently to make sure i knew i wasn’t dreaming

then its words gently echoed throughout my mind

the world you are in –

is the true hell

the journey to truth itself

is what quickens the heart to become lighter

the lighter the heart the purer it is

the purer the heart the closer to light it becomes

and the heavier the heart

the more chained to this hell

it will remain

and just like that it flew off towards the sun

so i picked it up

and fastened it to a toothpick

to dip into ink

and write my name

letter to fellow revolutionary astronomer johannes kepelr

but as long as something is never even started you never have to worry about it ending it has endless potential

in essence you are neither inferior nor superior to anyone true selfesteem and true humility arise out of that realization in the eyes of the ego selfesteem and humility are contradictory in truth they are one and the same

truth is naturally universaland shines into many different windows though many are clouded

to kill an error is as good a service as and sometimes even better than the establishing of a new truth or fact

your people your guards – they’re nothing more than killers rapists and thieves the only difference between them and criminals is the uniforms they wear

do not

forget duty but choose love when you can

i do maintain that if your hair is wrong your entire life is wrong

why are you lying to me im so tired of people lying to me do i not deserve the truth do i look like someone who cant handle it

he wondered about himself whether he was broken or special or better or worse and about other people whether they were really all as stupid as they seemed

what does it mean to live in truth putting it negatively is easy enough it means not lying not hiding and not dissimulating

i suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears and we marry him

the truth doesnt always make a good story does it

the author who benefits you most is not the one who tells you something you did not know before but the one who gives expression to the truth that has been dumbly struggling in you for utterance

too many people out there tell us what we can and cannot do but…they don’t know who we are what’s put in us

nothing is easier than selfdeceit

that he also believes to be true

do you want this to be a love story

it is error only and not truth that shrinks from inquiry

sometimes when i see a bad performance and people still clap i wonder if theyre clapping because they liked what they saw or because theyre happy its over

cant do it

brains empty

are you not ashamed of caring so much for the making of money and for fame and prestige when you neither think nor care about wisdom and truth and the improvement of your soul

the more attention you give to your loved ones the less affection you recieve from them

that man is best who sees the truth himself good too is he who listens to wise counsel but who is neither wise himself nor willing to ponder wisdom is not worth a straw

by and large the truth is not merely a fierce battle with ignorance and fallacy but first and foremost a combat with our own preconceived ideas and aprioristic conceptions the hidden sides of his character

if names be not correct language is not in accordance with the truth of things

eyes blinded by the fog of things

ears deafened by the din of things

brains bewildered by the whirl of things

hearts deadened by the weight of things

throats choked by the dust of things

if you dont love yourself you wont be happy with yourself if you cant love yourself you cant love anyone else you cant give the love you do not have you cant make anyone love you without loving yourself first

our lives are the only meaningful expression of what we believe and in whom we believe and the only real wealth for any of us lies in our faith

when people stargazing they stare at stars

and many other things which theyve already

presumed commonly and universally as stars

people work together when it suits them they’re loyal when it suits them they love each other when it suits them and they kill each other when it suits them

its a funny thing about life once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack

why if it was an illusion not praise the catastrophe whatever it was that destroyed illusion and put truth in its place

if what you seek is truth there is one thing you must have above all else i know an overwhelming passion for it no an unremitting readiness to admit you may be wrong

institutionalized rejection of difference is an absolute necessity in a profit economy which needs outsiders as surplus people

if you only write when inspired you may be a fairly decent poet but youll never be a novelist

the problem with religion because its been sheltered from criticism is that it allows people to believe en masse what only idiots or lunatics could believe in isolation

everything is true he said everything anybody has ever thought

will you be all right

ill be all right he said and thought and im going to die both those are true too

and where love ends hate begins

it is very hard to say the exact truth even about your own immediate feelings – much harder than to say something fine about them which is not the exact truth

great truths can only be forgotten and can never be falsified

i am an inconsistent creature perhaps it is the pressure of my past and not my own perverse mind that has made me into this contradictory being i am all too well aware of this fault in myself you must forgive me

its a strange truth that no matter how persuaded we might be of our own correctness the discomfiting realization that others disagree with us causes a paralyzing inability to argue the case convincingly

history is idle gossip about a happening whose truth is lost the instant it has taken place

when you showed someone how you felt it was fresh and honest when you told someone how you felt there might be nothing behind the words but habit or expectation

the moment you tell everyone you have a mental disorder in order to excuse your behavior

we never realize just how many other lives we can help when their paths cross our own

ive heard that the soul often recognizes truth when it hears it even if the mind does not

every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required

this had seemed a safe choice since to be against the beatles latemiddle period is to be against life

in fact the truth cannot be communicated until it is perceived

only courageous hearts can endure the bitterness of truth

i cannot encourage any fabrication even for the sake of making people feel good if i were to fabricate consciously and knowingly i would not only be ordaining myself their enemy but also ordaining myself gods enemy

men occasionally stumble over the truth but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing had happened

that first love and the first one who breaks your heart for me they just happen to be the same person

if you always attach positive emotions to the things you want and never attach negative emotions to the things you dont then that which you desire most will invariably come your way

humility is nothing but truth and pride is nothing but lying

i have never killed anybody it is true but it is because i lacked the courage or the time not because i lacked the desire

integrity is a bugger it really is lying can get you into difficulties but to really wind up in the crappers try telling nothing but the truth

i was flipping channels watching this cheerleading program on mtv they took a field hockey girl and transformed her into a cheerleader by the end of the show i was just wondering what if she liked field hockey better

two people with mental issues in a relationship does not work its like sitting in a boat and neither one has an oar to row the other to shore you can meet your mirror image in life but that doesnt mean you should marry him

you must accept the truth from whatever source it comes

from what ive witness honesty didnt really make anyone happy the truth was a punch to the gut and while you were falling a knee to the face then you could lie on the floor and bleed for a spell

i am in awe of flowers

not because of their colors

but because even though they

have dirt in their roots

they still grow

they still bloom

i would have offered you a forest of truth but you wish to speak of a single leaf

a women can run hide play and have fun but she will shine far better when she just smiles without none

you were the hardest year of my life and i’ve never been so happy what does that say about me

then i realized that most of the worlds problems stemmed from macho dickheadism and if i cold defeat that i could save the world

by their actions they will show you who they are

the secret of high financeif you really need a loan you wont qualify and if you dont need a loan all the lenders will line up to give you money

the truth that makes men free is for the most part the truth which men prefer not to hear

truth and facts are woven together however sometimes facts can blind you from seeing what is actually going on in someone’s life

there is no other way to determine the difference between the will of god and the crafts of satan jesus is the way the truth and the life the holy spirit of god is the comforter

religious structure often dilutes the spiritual experience

one truth doesnt refute another truth doesnt lie in the object but in how we see it

satires nature is to be onesided contemptuous of ambiguity and so unfairly selective as to find in the purity of ridicule an inarguable moral truth

truth is handsomer than the affectation of love your goodness must have some edge to itelse it is none

with the beginning of life comes the thirst for truth whereas the ability to lie is gradually acquired in the process of trying to stay alive

i am in revolt against the ageold lie that the majority is always right

see yourself as you really are

accept the good and the bad

only then can you truly share yourself with another

dont doubt yourself thats what haters are for

few things are more deceptive than memories

could it have been anyone or was it destiny when im considering this i find it helpful to quote the wisdom of my father who once told me who knows why the fuck anything happens

ill figure out how to be truer to let people go if they need to be let go of and to hold on tight if thats whats called for i will pay attention so i can cross each human heart that comes across my path cross it as true as i can

the only faithfulness people have is to emotions theyre trying to recapture

there are trivial truths and there are great truths the opposite of a trivial truth is plainly false the opposite of a great truth is also true

no one knows for sure that that tomorrow wont come

but most people assume that tomorrow will still exist as usual

this is tobas paradox which means hope overcomes doubt

men will not accept truth at the hands of their enemies and truth is seldom offered to them by their friends

love wasnt the soft silky words the poets spoke of lovewith its twin edges was the one factor that weakened so many women that pushed them to compromised their own wants their own needs for the needs and wants of another

there is nothing so powerful as truth  and often nothing so strange

you cant keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors you know eventually those snakes are going to turn on whoever has them in the backyard

too many doubts grow in the cracks of silence and separation

a woman with good shoes i never ugly

it is better to be divided by truth than to be united in error it is better to speak the truth that hurts and then heals than falsehood that comforts and then kills

do not accept anything as love which lacks truth

i would rather die an individual than live my life as a clone

happiness will grow if you plant the seeds of love in the garden of hope with compassion and care

always ask yourself what will happen if i say nothing

thus its covered

truth resists being projected into the realm of knowledge

smartass disciple what were you thinking when the truth is revealed unto you

master of stupidity i wasnt thinking i was having sex when it came to my mind

there are people who desperately want to change the world

i wonder if it could be measured because the world is already

in the state of continuously change since the beginning of time

or they may just want their names etched nicely on men history

eyes cant sense a smell of rain before it drops

mind cant see event of future before it happens

smartass disciple master i don’t need a fairytalei need you to tell me the truth

master of stupidity it is not funny if you just found it no drama if no lost at first

take away health wealth and material success and all you have is each other maybe thats the place we should start

smartass disciple what were said for things before the time exist

master of stupidity no words to be said by no man at no time at all

smartass disciple please teach me about the truth master

master of stupidity hmmmtell me about your sexperience

smartass disciple  master why you keep telling about the truth nobody hears

master of stupidity  o yea they hear but dont listen anyway no fun in silent

i do not say words which you want to hear

the words just told me to write them down

smartass disciple master i believe that the truth will prevail at the end

master of stupidity no the end for the truth prevail is something else

it wasnt science and technology that cause a slow progress

but collective knowledge of the society and market demands

colonel tell me what is the truth doctor

smartass disciple master why god let human did sins in the beginning

master of stupidity if the saviour must come why should he prevent that

thus shall you think of all this fleeting world

a star at dawn a bubble in a stream

a flickering lamp a phantom and a dream

bigotry dwarfs the soul by shutting out the truth

error is indeed our enemy but it alone points to the truth and therefore deserves our respectful treatment

when the dead departed they took away any falsehoods that they might have allowed us to believe while alive we who are left behind have to embark on a different life since the dead are no longer here to help us deceive ourselves

the best way to know the truth or beauty is to try to express it and what is the purpose of existence here or yonder but to discover truth and beauty and express it ie share it with others

sometimes a clearly defined error is the only way to discover the truth

any clod can have the facts but having opinions is an art

he who thought it necessary to maintain himself in her good graces strove to console her under her disappointment by committing a little violence upon truth

history is a better guide than good intentions

think of the truth many would hide it distort it change it bury it or even destroy it but the uncorrupted truth the unparalleled truth shall always come out

how do you seek the truth

when you seek for the truth are you guided with an honest heart

why do you seek the truth

or are you among those folks who prefer to hide or bury the truth thinking that the majority won’t find it out

if and when the truth comes out are you among those persons who will target sacrificial lambs for scapegoats

it is wise to remember that the truth however hidden shall eventually come out

a cameroonian proverb says water always finds a way out

the same thing i can say about the truth

the truth however hidden shall eventually come out

the water flows the stones remain

the lies flow the truth remains

the truth thrives forever

angelica hopes an excerpt from kh trilogy

questions of absolute good and evil are much better not opened to public debate these days when so few people are sure of their absolutes

people usually feel funny smile and laugh when i tell them

about my strong belief in the very existence of prehistoric

advanced technology and great civilizations of wilier races

i just cant wait to see their faces at time the truth is revealed

the worst enemy of unscrupulous political movers and dishonest destructive greedy ambitious machiavellian politicians is the truth

angelica hopes the f f trilogy

deep down everyone wants the truth

righteousness is the truth revealed and working in you

we are often jealous of our little secrets though to another ear they generally convey neither profit nor entertainment

the wheel of life has many spokes yet so few people ever leave the hub

so you didn’t tell me it was a messedup idea to keep this all a secret because

what’s that

the truth

nothing is build just like that everything around the world has some value and the purpose

those who scorn you taunt only themselves  i knew this without reading one word because in reading one is reminded of the truth man is given at birth  by man i mean man and woman

i am not pointing fingers but rather pointing at the facts as the facts point fingers regardless

few of us are lucky enough ever to know the whole truth about anything

we see everything through the filter of our own desires and regrets hopes and fears

stand up for what is right even if you stand alone stand up for truth regardless of who steps on it

the most striking difference between ancient and modern sophists is that the ancients were satisfied with a passing victory of the argument at the expense of truth whereas the moderns want a more lasting victory at the expense of reality

in my experience it is always worth it to find the love that lives inside you no matter how deep you have to dig sometimes

we should change the name of ars to marco rubio because they are so easy to buy

truth often finds its way to the mind close muffled in robes of sleep and then speaks with uncompromising directness of matters in regard to which we practise an unconscious selfdeception during our waking moments

fiction is truth even if it is not a fact if you believe only in facts and forget stories your brain will live but your heart will die

dont let the eyes guide the heart but have the heart guide the eyes

well when you wonder something said eli doesnt that mean part of you wants to believe in it i think we want to prove things in life more then we want to disprove them we want to believe

the only truth which she could discover was the truth of what she herself felt

too much study wears the body but the truth refreshes the soul sustains the spirit for a beautiful body

daylight tricks you into thinking what you see is truth lets you go through life thinking you know everything but the truth is we are sleepwalkers we walk through the night that is chaos and dark and forever keeps its truth to itself

i dont question anything further because you dont question people when they open up to you you just listen or you should

if only one existence listens to it and takes it into consideration then you dont even have to tell the truth in telling other things you will invariably tell the truth as well even if you or the truth wish otherwise

remember pia he whispers perfect is as perfect does

when people challenge your ideas they help you whether they know it or not

ego is like cyanide instantly kills dialogue always needs to be kept satisfied

we stand and fight for god’s truth and with the truth we will win

lying he said out loud hoping no one would hear i need to lie teach me quickly

mortal minds are always unsettled by eternal things they want to catch the infinite and nail it down to something finite impossible

almost instinctively he went about learning the truth and at the same time disbelieved it

i never recognized sunshine shining me within me

there is only one thing that is more natural than thinking breathing and it is in breathing that we find the door to happiness

if you do not have control over your mouth you will not have control over your future

a system is corrupt when it is strictly profitdriven not driven to serve the best interests of its people

sorrow is knowledge they who know the most must mourn the deepest o’er the fatal truth the tree of knowledge is not that of life

the thing about memories wasnt that many of them inevitably faded but that repeated recall of the ones you remembered burnished them into shining gorgeous lies

you have to understand yourself before you can understand anything else

i am for

one world without fear and corruption

one world ruled by truth and justice

i am for

one peaceful world for all

where hate has been overcome by love

and everyone is guided only

by their conscience

it takes courage to become authentic so many talk about the light but not enough speak the truth about the struggles it takes to get there and the tools to overcome it all

always be truthful and you will have fewer visits from regret guilt or fear

it doesnt matter what you think about consciousness higher truths or different dimensions  its what you do and what you are that counts

people hide truths about themselves from themselves such selfdeception is a coping mechanism and to one extent or another most people begin deceiving themselves when theyre children

oh sweetie no one ever gets through their tbr list for every book you finish youll add five more thats just the way it works

and yet is not mankind itself pushing on its blind way driven by a dream of its greatness and its power upon the dark paths of excessive cruelty and of excessive devotion and what is the pursuit of truth after all

the truth which sets men free is the truth which most men fear to accept

immortality it is impossible to be conscious of being unconscious

how do you know you are dead it is not possible to be aware of any gaps in life it is continuous and neverending from your own point of view

death and birth are a continuous event from your own perspective

you will die physically but you will be born into a new physical body being born happens or you would not be here now you were born into this life it is what we know happens there is no evidence anything else happens true or false

she had said he had been driven away from her by a dreamand there was no answer one could make herthere seemed to be no forgiveness for such a transgression

and yet is not mankind itself pushing on its blind way driven by a dream of its greatness and its power upon the dark paths of excessive cruelty and of excessive devotion and what is the pursuit of truth after all

if one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child then one million of you are a million times guilty

three things have a limited threshold

time pain and death

while truth love and knowledge –

are boundless

three things are needed

for humanity to coexist

truth peace and basic needs

the principles you know determines what you get

finally finally this is what bravery looks like this is what courage looks like it has nothing to do with dominating the day every single day it has to do with showing up and speaking truth one true sentence after one true sentence

its not getting it right the first timeits learning to do it right and then not getting lazy

every time we choose our past over our present we kill our future

no crime is a means to an end no crime can be rationalized

if one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty

civilization is a myth that is the truth this world has taught us we have not risen above our baser instincts that is what always has and always will drive us

dont be so loyal to your mind the mind is not loyal to you

you never know who youre inspiring or uninspiring people notice more than you think

people often associate complexity with deeper meaning when often after precious time has been lost it is realized that simplicity is the key to everything

i’m in no hurry the sun and the moon aren’t either

nobody goes faster than the legs they have

if where i want to go is far away i’m not there in an instant

never settle for half the story and makeup and imagine the rest get the full story

everything’s different from us that’s why everything exists

after many years we were still at that first stage still

preparing to begin a journey but we were changed nevertheless

we could see this in one another we had changed although

we never moved and one said ah behold how we have aged traveling

from day to night only neither forward nor sideward and this seemed

in a strange way miraculous and those who believed we should have a purpose

believed this was the purpose and those who felt we must remain free

in order to encounter truth felt it had been revealed

let the love of the moon kiss you good night

let the morning sun wake you up with loving light

how horrible and beautiful it is that our eyes blur the truth when we cant bear to see it

if science wants to be truthful

what science is more truthful than the science of things without science

i close my eyes and the hard earth where i’m lying

has a reality so real even my back feels it

i don’t need reason — i have shoulderblades

truths are dangerous he said

then why are you writing them in a book

to catch them between the pages said teddy and trap them before they disappear

make her smile make her laugh and make her happy because this is the only truth meaning  beauty act any human can ever achieve

knowing the truth is not based on knowledge but on being it

something changed in part of reality — my knees and my hands

what science has knowledge for this

the blind man goes on his way and i don’t make any more gestures

it’s already not the same time or the same people or anything the same

this is being real

truthfulness is a luxury perhaps the greatest and let me assure you the most expensive luxury in our life—and happy the man who has been able to enjoy it from his very child hood

you must feed yourself the truth because the world is sure to serve you lies

i was born subject like others to errors and defects

but never to the error of wanting to understand too much

never to the error of wanting to understand only with the intellect

never to the defect of demanding of the world

that it be anything that’s not the world

between what i see in a field and what i see in another field

there passes for a moment the figure of a man

his steps go with him in the same reality

but i look at him and them and they’re two things

the man goes walking with his ideas false and foreign

and his steps go with the ancient system that makes legs walk

i see him from a distance without any opinion at all

how perfect that he is in him what he is — his body

his true reality which doesn’t have desires or hopes

but muscles and the sure and impersonal way of using them

the amorous shepherd is a fruitless interlude but those few poems are among the world’s greatest love poems because they’re love poems about love not about being poems the poet loves because he loves not because love exists

god speaks to you all the time  have you tuned in to the cosmic vibrations of love harmony peace and truth unless you quieten that blabbering little mind of yours you won’t be able to listen to the divine music that plays on and on

just for one heavenly second shut your eyes ears and mind to the cacophonous noises of this physical illusionary temporary world exit all the drama

just for that one heavenly second stay quiet and simply listen listen to the ambrosial sound it vibrates with joy

you can have more of this soulful peace in your life if only you choose to align yourself with the source of love and light the more you stay attuned to home the less you’d wander invain

the man that wars and judges others is eternally lost the man that wars and judges himself is eternally found

error by force of contrast enhances the triumph of truth

he woman caeiro fell in love with i have no idea who she was and i intend to never find out not even out of curiosity there are things of which the soul refuses to lose its ignorance

i’m perfectly aware no one’s obliged to reciprocate love and great poets have nothing to do with being great lovers but there’s a transcendent spite

let her remain anonymous even to god

you dont need passwords you dont want to check phones sometimes you only want the other person to just tell you the truth

no truth no light

your personal truth is your gift to the world

therefore i lied to please the mob

now all my lies are proved untrue

and i must face the men i slew

what tale shall serve me here among

from epitaphs of the war

i pass and i stay like the universe

after years of searching i have found my soulmate and it is myself the bachelor is content oh he still dates women from time to time and he listens to the wedding marches sometimes too but only because he likes them

if we forget our story we were doomed to repeat it

a row of trees far away there on the hillside

but what is it a row of trees it’s just trees

row and the plural trees aren’t things they’re names

only rose and her white bear know the whole truth of it

not all things can be expressed through words not all the words reflect the truth

truth is worse than soap in the eyes

you lie to her you lie to me you lie to yourself blind girl blind you

why is the truth usually not just un but antiinteresting

conways thoughts on the great robert ingersoll

silence is a powerful tool

all the evil in the world comes from us bothering with each other

wanting to do good wanting to do evil

our soul and the sky and the earth are enough for us

to want more is to lose this and be unhappy

intentions of a man reflects in his actions

were all so multifaceted and its impossible to see all the sides at once

only by learning the truth—whatever that truth might be—could people be given the right kind of power

life would again have to make superhuman efforts as in a battle to break open for himself a path through the truths created by the sciences which dream of being but cannot see it in waking reality

the path for those who go with the truth is not is not that smooth guns crosses and hangmen in the gallows are waiting for them

a writer inevitably  and less directly this applies to all the arts  about contemporary events and his impulse is to tell what he believes to be truth but no government no big organisation will pay for the truth

the amorous shepherd has lost his staff

and his sheep are straying on the hillside

and he didn’t even play the flute he brought to play because he was thinking so much

no one came to him or went away he never found his staff again

others cursing at him gathered his sheep for him

no one had loved him in the end

when he got up from the hillside and the false truth he saw everything

the great valleys full of the same green as always

the great distant mountains more real than any feeling

all reality with the sky and the air and the fields that exist is present

and once again the air that he’d missed for so long entered coolly into his lungs

and he felt that the air was opening again but with pain a liberty in his chest

the fishhook catches the fish the truth catches the lie the death catches the life the love catches the hate

update your truth there is no soul there is only mind and body update your truth or the truth will update you the truth and the science are the greatest updaters

i dont say it was likely  i only say it is true

success will not come when you read success quotations it wont leave once you inspired and apply it

true ideas seem to suffer from repetition while stupid ones tend to flourish

a joke is a good camouflage next best comes sentiment but the best camouflage of all  in my opinion  is the plain and simple truth because nobody ever believes it

the lady dare not lift her veil

for fear it be dispelled

but peers beyond her mesh

and wishes and denies—

that image satisfies

in the essence of truth lies deceit

vivid simplicity is the articulation the nature of genius wisdom is greater than intelligence intelligence is greater than philosobabble

but vain to popularize profundities and all truth is profound

it was strange how she found out one moment she didnt know the next minute she did one moment her mind was as blank as the desert the next minute the snake of suspicion had slithered into her thoughts and raised its poisonous head

hey metaphysics seminar is on the roof just take the elevator up and keep walking until you hit the sidewalk anything is true if enough people believe it

sometimes you have to do something ugly so that something beautiful can grow

the mistakes we regret the most are the ones we were too scared to make

in a myriad of ways you tell one truth

from time to time

i once wondered how one wanders from time to time

and think up the paradox line

speak of epochs crime

oh i lied it hasnt happened yet

but bet you better believe its such a habit that

i just said that in a past mindset

truth without love isnt

to be taught what true love is also teaches you never to love again for true love comes once in a lifetime and last for all eternity dc

tell the truth no matter who it hurts

man must be certain of his morality for the simple reason that he has to suffer for it

some way some how im going to be happy im going to laugh im going to prosperi feel good that i remain positive thru these mess up times

facts like living things have a value in and of themselves and demand respect yet some people use them as means to an end and dismiss them as soon as they are done using them

memories that you remember are truth of your life

the truth﻿ about life will change this world into heaven and you into an immortal spiritual being

the trial of poppy moon is free over easter

truth is only what we like to hear

a thousand truths can be assembled in such a way as to create a colossal lie

as time and space are bent by gravity so too is truth bent by power

quid quo pro  you cant get something from nothing

contradiction is not a sign of falsity nor the lack of contradiction a sign of truth

everything that iscasts a shadow

alanna didnt approve of lying but in a pinch a lie was sometimes better than the truth

speak you too

speak as the last

say out your say

but don’t split off no from yes

give your say this meaning too

give it the shadow

give it shadow enough

give it as much

as you know is spread round you from

midnight to midday and midnight

see how things all come alive

by death alive

speaks true who speaks shadow

but now the place shrinks where you stand

where now shadowstripped where

thinner you grow less knowable finer

the star wants to descend on

so as to swim down beliow down here

where it sees itself shimmerin the swell

the devil has not vanished simply because people refuse to believe he exists no more than god has

a noble leader answers not to the trumpet calls of self promotion but to the hushed whispers of necessity

high above the noise and fear mongering of critics and cynics softly speaks your true self

i beseech you in the bowels of christ think it possible you may be mistaken

i felt as i have often felt that my failing the truth could have no bearing at all on the truth itself which could never conceivably be in any sense dependent on me or on anyone

the only true thing is whats in front of you right now

the problem with escaping is that we leave behind us even among those we love different versions of the truth and everything we couldn’t bring ourselves to say

it’s madness to see life as it is and not how it should be

i died last night seventy years too young

i’m a dinosaur he thought lumbering through a world where truthtellers

are despised

why do people complain when your crabby but the moment there crabby you tell them to stop moaning they moan so fuckin unreal

you dear reader have now two accounts to choose between and there can be no doubt which is most probable

why do you give way to your ego and pride where does it stand in the ocean of time

why does truth carry such a dreadful face why does subjugation carry such a happy mask it becomes sad when people understand that they can lead a better life as long as they bow their heads ignoring the truth
