believe there is a great power silently working all things for good behave yourself and never mind the rest

rejection is an opportunity for your selection

my soul is in the sky

you cant know you can only believe  or not

prejudice a dirty word and faith a clean one have something in common they both begin where reason ends

as a well spent day brings happy sleep so life well used brings happy death

the most confused you will ever get is when you try to convince your heart and spirit of something your mind knows is a lie

to be grateful is to recognize the love of god in everything he has given us  and he has given us everything every breath we draw is a gift of his love every moment of existence is a grace for it brings with it immense graces from him

dance smile giggle marvel trust hope love wish believe most of all enjoy every moment of the journey and appreciate where you are at this moment instead of always focusing on how far you have to go

no dont give up hope just yet its the last thing to go when you have lost hope you have lost everything and when you think all is lost when all is dire and bleak there is always hope

god turns you from one feeling to another and teaches by means of opposites so that you will have two wings to fly not one

is that you cannot waste it in advance

the next year the next day the next hour are lying ready for you

as if you had never wasted or misapplied

a single moment in all your life

you can turn over a new leaf every hour

if you choose

i know of no society in human history that ever suffered because its people became too desirous of evidence in support of their core beliefs

because you believed i was capable of behaving decently i did

a bridge of silver wings stretches from the dead ashes of an unforgiving nightmare

to the jeweled vision of a life started anew

realize that if a door closed it’s because what was behind it wasn’t meant for you

never lose faith in yourself and never lose hope remember even when this world throws its worst and then turns its back there is still always hope

having faith in god did not mean sitting back and doing nothing it meant believing you would find success if you did your best honestly and energetically

it’s okay to be scared being scared means you’re about to do something really really brave

faith is not something to grasp it is a state to grow into

faith can be very very dangerous and deliberately to implant it into the vulnerable mind of an innocent child is a grievous wrong

my father gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person he believed in me

long process and that youll work on things slowly one at a time

faith is about what you do its about aspiring to be better and nobler and kinder than you are its about making sacrifices for the good of others  even when theres not going to be anyone telling you what a hero you are

persistence perfection patience power prioritize your passion it keeps you sane

for in grief nothing stays put one keeps on emerging from a phase but it always recurs round and round everything repeats am i going in circles or dare i hope i am on a spiral

but if a spiral am i going up or down it

how often  will it be for always  how often will the vast emptiness astonish me like a complete novelty and make me say i never realized my loss till this moment the same leg is cut off time after time

when you are in troubled and worried and sick at heart

and your plans are upset and your world falls apart

remember gods ready and waiting to share

the burden you find much to heavy to bear

so with faith let go and let god lead your way

into a brighter and less troubled day

when god is going to do something wonderful he or she always starts with a hardship when god is going to do something amazing he or she starts with an impossibility

sorrow looks back worry looks around faith looks up

faith in the sense in which i am here using the word is the art of holding on to things your reason has once accepted in spite of your changing moods

you were born a child of light’s wonderful secret— you return to the beauty you have always been

good works is giving to the poor and the helpless but divine works is showing them their worth to the one who matters

i had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith

when all is said and done the life of faith is nothing if not an unending struggle of the spirit with every available weapon against the flesh

don’t let mental blocks control you set yourself free confront your fear and turn the mental blocks into building blocks

it is not the strength of your faith but the object of your faith that actually saves you

when someone you love says goodbye you can stare long and hard at the door they closed and forget to see all the doors god has open in front of you

when we are powerless to do a thing it is a great joy that we can come and step inside the ability of jesus

you have as much laughter as you have faith

if you live gladly to make others glad in god your life will be hard your risks will be high and your joy will be full

god will never give you anything you cant handle so dont stress

in order to have faith in his own path he does not need to prove that someone elses path is wrong

i am afraid that the schools will prove the very gates of hell unless they diligently labor in explaining the holy scriptures and engraving them in the heart of the youth

you cannot reason people out of a position that they did not reason themselves into

regardless of what i think about islam or wicca or any other religion the fact is that its a group of people every faith has its ceremonies and since its made up of people every faith also has its assholes

any faith that must be supported by the evidence of the senses is not real faith

faith is not desire faith is will desires are things that need to be satisfied whereas will is a force will changes the space around us

to choose dogma and faith over doubt and experience is to throw out the ripening vintage and to reach greedily for the koolaid

the lord works from the inside out the world works from the outside in the world would take people out of the slums christ would take the slums out of people and then they would take themselves out of the slums

the world would mold men by changing their environment christ changes men who then change their environment the world would shape human behavior but christ can change human nature

god will not be used as a convenience men or nations who think they can revive the faith in order to make a good society might just as well think they can use the stairs of heaven as a shortcut to the nearest chemists shop

head up heart open to better days

it is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels worthy of himself and claims kindred to the great god who made him

when faith replaces doubt when selfless service eliminates selfish striving the power of god brings to pass his purposes

faith is belief in what you cannot see or prove or touch faith is walking facefirst and fullspeed into the dark

true love is taking the risk that it wont be a happilyeverafter true love is joining hands with the man who loves you for who you are and saying im not afraid to believe in you

there lives more faith in honest doubt believe me than in half the creeds

talk to me about the truth of religion and ill listen gladly talk to me about the duty of religion and ill listen submissively but dont come talking to me about the consolations of religion or i shall suspect that you dont understand

just because you can explain it doesnt mean its not still a miracle

and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains but have not love i am nothing

we live by faith and not by sight

love is happiness but only when you believe it will last forever even though every time it turns out to be a lie it’s only faith that gives love its strength and its joy

when everything gets answered its fake

in order to share ones true brilliance one initially has to risk looking like a fool genius is like a wheel that spins so fast it at first glance appears to be sitting still

love is as simple as the absence of self given to another god when invited fills the void of any unrequited love hence loving is how one is drawn closer to god no matter its most horrific repercussions

silent solitude makes true speech possible and personal if i am not in touch with my own belovedness then i cannot touch the sacredness of others if i am estranged from myself i am likewise a stranger to others

understanding is the reward of faith therefore seek not to understand that you may believe but believe that you may understand

faith is an oasis in the heart which will never be reached by the caravan of thinking

i feel no need for any other faith than my faith in the kindness of human beings i am so absorbed in the wonder of earth and the life upon it that i cannot think of heaven and angels

the word i think of is precarious i am struck by how precarious it all is how the things that hold us are only as strong as the faith we have in them

as idle as a painted ship

your heart’s strength is measured by how hard it holds on your self worth and faith is measured by finally letting go however your peace is measured by how long you don’t look back

god does not require that we be successful only that we be faithful

faith strikes me as intellectual laziness

nobody wants to look like a fool nine times out of ten that

reason alone keeps people from allowing themselves to believe

the opposite of the religious fanatic is not the fanatical atheist but the gentle cynic who cares not whether there is a god or not

islam expect every muslim to do this duty and if we realise our responsibility time will come soon when we shall justify ourselves worthy of a glorious past

but to mean it when i say that i want my life to count for his glory is to drive a stake through the heart of self  a painful and determined dying to me that must be a part of every day i live

he who has not god in himself cannot feel his absence

his wonders to performs

for he who loves god without faith reflects on himself while the person who loves god in faith reflects on god

she was completely whole

and yet never fully complete

it would be the height of absurdity to label ignorance tempered by humility faith

disbelief is more resistant than faith because it is sustained by the senses

it must be comforting to have a faith like that to believe so concretely that there’s someone—something— out there watching guard keeping us safe testing us only with what we can handle

faith in god includes faith in gods timing

but for me the sweetest contact with god has no form i close my eyes look within and enter a deep soft silence the infinity of gods creation embraces me

reason is a whore the greatest enemy that faith has it never comes to the aid of spiritual things but more frequently than not struggles against the divine word treating with contempt all that emanates from god

shine your soul with the same

egoless humility as the rainbow

and no matter where you go

in this world or the next

love will find you attend you and bless you

come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light

the more you go with the flow of life and surrender the outcome to god and the less you seek constant clarity the more you will find that fabulous things start to show up in your life

there’s something really cool about knowing that your destiny is so big that you’re not meant to share it with anyone at least not yet

i love the recklessness of faith first you leap and then you grow wings

when you are down to nothing god is up to somethng it is up to you to reach out to find what god is up to for you

if merely feeling good could decide drunkenness would be the supremely valid human experience

adam understood then that gansey and blue’s awe changed this place ronan and adam may have seen this place as magical but gansey and blue’s wonder made it holy

does your love reach this far god and if it extends to heaven and beyond… why can’t it seem to find me

were stronger than we think

it is not as much about who you used to be as it is about who you choose to be

at times one remains faithful to a cause only because its opponents do not cease to be insipid

let your life reflect the faith you have in god fear nothing and pray about everything be strong trust gods word and trust the process

the same everlasting father who cares for you today will care for you tomorrow and every day

either he will shield you from suffering or give you unfailing strength to bear it

be at peace then and put aside all anxious thoughts and imaginings

faith and love are apt to be spasmodic in the best minds men live the brink of mysteries and harmonies into which they never enter and with their hands on the doorlatch they die outside

thats how you avoid becoming a moth he says stop asking others what to believe figure it out for yourself

lifes trials will test you and shape you but don’t let them change who you are

the christian should work as if all depended upon him and pray as if it all depended upon god

our hearts of stone become hearts of flesh when we learn where the outcast weeps

we are not on this planet to ask forgiveness of our deities

you need to have faith in yourself be brave and take risks you dont have to have it all figured out to move forward

pactum serva  keep the faith

what we are waiting for is not as important as what happens to us while we are waiting trust the process

to have faith is to be sure of the things we hope for to be certain of the things we cannot see

i will not attack your doctrines nor your creeds if they accord liberty to me if they hold thought to be dangerous  if they aver that doubt is a crime then i attack them one and all because they enslave the minds of men

i attack the monsters the phantoms of imagination that have ruled the world i attack slavery i ask for room  room for the human mind

faith is a fine invention

when gentlemen can see

but microscopes are prudent

in an emergency

i can only say that i am nothing but a poor sinner trusting in christ alone for salvation

there had to be dark and muddy waters so that the sun could have something to background its flashing glory

surrender is a gift that you can give yourself its an act of faith its saying that even though i cant see where this river is flowing i trust it will take me in the right direction

my faith is big enough to accept all of gods wonders

back of every creation supporting it like an arch is faith enthusiasm is nothing it comes and goes but if one believes then miracles occur

our kindness may be the most persuasive argument for that which we believe

faith doesnt mean that you never doubt it only means that you never act upon your doubts

what do people fear most about death i asked the reb

fear he thought for a moment well for one thing what happens next where do we go is it what we imagined

thats big

yes but theres something else

what else

he leaned forward

being forgotten he whispered

the insistence on the absolutely indiscriminate nature of compassion within the kingdom is the dominant perspective of almost all of jesus teaching

what makes the kingdom come is heartfelt compassion a way of tenderness that knows no frontiers no labels no compartmentalizing and no sectarian divisions

my mind tells me ill never understand god

my heart tells me im not meant to

what we call rational grounds for our beliefs are often extremely irrational attempts to justify our instincts

living in a world such as this is like dancing on a live volcano

history has shown that the most terrible crimes against love have been committed in the name of fanatically defended doctrines

it is better to live ready than to get ready

its in those quiet little towns at the edge of the world that you will find the salt of the earth people who make you feel right at home

faith makes all things possible love makes them easy

you have to stand guard over the development and maintenance of islamic democracy islamic social justice and the equality of manhood in your own native soil

god existed before every religion he exists in spite of all religions

the greatest act of faith some days is to simply get up and face another day

in loves service only wounded soldiers can serve

i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die

the soul hardly ever realizes it but whether he is a believer or not his loneliness is really a homesickness for god

faith is not about finding meaning in the world there may be no such thing  faith is the belief in our capacity to create meaningful lives

much of what we called depression was really dissatisfaction a result of setting a bar impossibly high or expecting treasures we werent willing to work for

perhaps evil is the crucible of goodness and perhaps even satan  satan in spite of himself  somehow serves to work out the will of god

by what men think we create the world around us daily new

aura im really patient but im not a bloody saint

if you place your bet with god you lose nothing even if it turns out that god does not exist but if you place it against god and you are wrong and god does exist you lose everything

love without hope will not survive

love gives power to hope and faith

we fall from womb to tomb from one blackness and toward another remembering little of the one and knowing nothing of the other  except through faith

to believe that what has not occurred in history will not occur at all is to argue disbelief in the dignity of man

faith is accepting what makes no sense what we cannot prove but know down deep in our souls is real

when you arent sincere you need to pretend and by pretending you end up believing yourself thats the basic principle of every faith

daughter we didnt need your note  or a princes visit  to tell us youd done nothing wrong we know the daughter we raised we fear for your future but never for your character you take our love and our trust wherever you wander

the difference between faith and insanity is that faith is the ability to hold firmly to a conclusion that is incompatible with the evidence whereas insanity is the ability to hold firmly to a conclusion that is incompatible with the evidence

faith is a copout if the only way you can accept an assertion is by faith then you are conceding that it cant be taken on its own merits it is intellectual bankruptcy

unless you are willing to do the ridiculous god will not do the miraculous when you have god you don’t have to know everything about it you just do it

do not ask directions from the people around you ask directions from the person who called you

and what god do you serve then

whichever will grant me good fortune

i don’t think gods work that way

i don’t think i care

he who believes needs no explanation

faith isn’t never having any doubts it’s having what you need to overcome them

confidence in others honesty is no light testimony of ones own integrity

does trust have to be earned or is it simply a matter of faith

they say time is money but thats not true time is life and if i want the fullest life i need to find fullest time the busyness of your life leaving little room for the source of your life

god gives us time and who has time for god

which makes no sense

we tend to be preoccupied by our problems when we have a heightened sense of vulnerability and a diminished sense of power today see each problem as an invitation to prayer

faith is what makes life bearable with all its tragedies and ambiguities and sudden startling joys

faith is a knowledge within the heart beyond the reach of proof

today is today only today

tomorrowit will only be yesterday

your least favorite virtue or nominee for the most overrated one faith closely followed—in view of the overall shortage of time—by patience

its a good sign but rare instance when in a relationship you find that the more you learn about the other person the more you continue to desire them a sturdy bond delights in that degree of youthful intrigue love loves its youth

the faith is not the problem bernadette the problem is the faithful

for all works and things which are either commanded or forbidden by god and thus have been instituted by the

supreme majesty are musts nevertheless no one should be dragged to them or away from them by the hair for i can drive no man to heaven or beat him into it with a club

black and white

i was born into

but with so many other

religions and

how do i know which

is it not

my birthright

to seek out the light

to find truth

after surveying all the proof

am i supposed

to love

or fight

and why do all those who

try to guide me

always start by dividing

and multiplying me –

from what they consider

wrong or right

there were no walls

for whoever beams truth and light

and how can one speak on lights behalf

lf all they do

but talk white

i was in love with everything i wanted to look with love at the angry people so that their eyes would be forced to respond and i wanted to bring gifts to the envious and tell them that i am worthless

our lives are the only meaningful expression of what we believe and in whom we believe and the only real wealth for any of us lies in our faith

i show my scars so that others know they can heal

im a member and preacher to that church where the blind dont see and the lame dont walk and whats dead stays that way

they will become godly when they will have god in their hearts

there is a wisdom in children a kind of knowing a kind of believing that we as adults do not have there is a time when a kingdom needs its children

we see them as they cannot will not see each otherwe see his heart in the way he looks at her we see her soul calling out for his every touch it would be so easy if they could only see inside each other as we can

sometimes you are in the middle of your destiny before you even know it has begun

faith is a place of mystery where we find the courage to believe in what we cannot see and the strength to let go of our fear of uncertainty

but how we ask

then the voice says they have washed their robes and have made them white in the blood of the lamb

there they are there we are  the multitude who so wanted to be faithful who at times got defeated soiled by life and bested by trials wearing the bloodied garments of lifes tribulations but through it all clung to faith

my friends if this is not good news to you you have never understood the gospel of grace

hearts rebuilt from hope resurrect dreams killed by hate

your faith will not fail while god sustains it you are not strong enough to fall away while god is resolved to hold you

you dont get to advertise all the good that your religion does without first scrupulously subtracting all the harm it does and considering seriously the question of whether some other religion or no religion at all does better

true wisdom consists in two things knowledge of god and knowledge of self

the closer one approaches to god the simpler one becomes

and when all your faith is gone let it be me if its a friend you need let it be me

faith is an organ of knowledge and love an organ of experience

dream big wake up take the first step into the unknown

the aim of all christian education moreover is to train the believer in an adult faith that can make him a new creation capable of bearing witness in his surroundings to the christian hope that inspires him

even now i wonder how much of my life is convinced

the whole war between the atheist and the theist comes down to this the atheist believes a what created the universe the theist believes a who created the universe

faith is not a blind thing for faith begins with knowledge it is not a speculative thing for faith believes facts of which it is sure it is not an unpractical dreamy thing for faith trusts and stakes its destiny upon the truth of revelation

managing stress is about controlling the way you respond to events and having an open mind about the things that stress you learn to talk to god during the day and ask him to give you peace and to help you with your problems

from this point forward you don’t even know how to quit in life

and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor

that would require faith i do not beliebe in faith i believe it exists but i do not believe it works i dont know what the rules are here i cant risk throwing everything away on a long shot

let the world know what you live fornot what you fall for

i plead with younever ever give up on hope never doubt never tire and never become discouraged be not afraid

intellect is a part of a good faith intellect is the light the heart is the direction

there can only be two basic loves the love of god unto the forgetfulness of self or the love of self unto the forgetfulness and denial of god

have faith have faith when you have nothing else have faith

faith is like love it does not let itself be forced

i am as sure as i live that nothing is so near to me as god god is nearer to me than i am to myself my existence depends on the nearness and the presence of god

the majority of my patients consisted not of believers but of those who had lost their faith

belief doesnt rest on proof or existenceit rests on faithwithout faith there is nothing

of course you dont believe in fairies youre fifteen you think i believed in fairies at fifteen took me until i was at least a hundred and forty hundred and fifty maybe anyway he wasnt a fairy he was a librarian all right

what looks like politics and imagines itself to be political will one day unmask itself as a religious movement

when you see no present advantage walk by faith and not by sight do god the honor to trust him when it comes to matters of loss for the sake of principle

fatigue is here in my body in my legs and eyes that is what gets you in the end faith is only a word embroidered

as emmanuel cardinal suhard says to be a witness does not consist in engaging in propaganda nor even in stirring people up but in being a living mystery it means to live in such a way that ones life would not make sense if god did not exist

the bible makes it clear that every time that there is a story of faith it is completely original gods creative genius is endless

to many people free will is a license to rebel not against what is unjust or hard in life but against what is best for them and true

if the almighty directs our steps weve no need to look back over our shoulders

believe more deeply hold your face up to the lighteven though for the moment you do not see

faith is believing in something you know isnt true

love only fails when we fail to love

god never said that we wouldn’t have unfair situations that we wouldn’t experience loss but he promised if we would stay in faith he would restore everything that was stolen

i believe in evolution in the sense that a shorttempered man is the successor of a crybaby

faith gives you an inner strength and a sense of balance and perspective in life

the sorrow of god lies in our fear of him our fear of life and our fear of ourselves he anguishes over our selfabsorption and selfsufficiency gods sorrow lies in our refusal to approach him when we sinned and failed

if the sun and moon should ever doubt theyd immediately go out

a pure heart is superlatively rare and even more attractive

my nature has always been to fight my faith forces me to forgive

faith is the highest passion in a human being many in every

generation may not come that far but none comes further

no one could really hate a saint could they they cant really hate god either when they want to hate him and his saints they have to find something like themselves and pretends its god and hate that

if humor and rumor are needed more than faith and truth

then it tells me something about the kind of world we live today

belief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul unbelief in denying them

i told him i had once lost everything i had too and that i think that can be god’s way of building walls around us to force us to look up at him

the goal of prayer is to live all of my life and speak all of my words in the joyful awareness of the presence of god

prayer becomes real when we grasp the reality and goodness of gods constant presence with the real me jesus lived his everyday life in conscious awareness of his father

do not suppose that i have come to bring peace to the earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword

when your only regret is if anyone thinks you regret anything  that is the definition of conviction

faith is not believing in my own unshakable belief faith is believing an unshakable god when everything in me trembles and quakes

occasionally some backtalk

from the mute sky i cant honestly complain

out of kitchen table or chair

as if a celestial burning took

possession of the most obtuse objects now and then

christian spirituality was not a childrens story it wasnt cute or neat it was mystical and odd and clean and it was reaching into dirty there was wonder in it and enchantment

suffering provides the gym equipment on which my faith can be exercised

there comes a time

when you have to let go

all the words

all the teaching

and trust the infinite

all you have to go on is the faith of a kiss

since the beginning of time spirituality and religion have been called to fill in the gaps that science did not understand

allah tests our patience and our fortitude he tests out strength of faith be patient and there will endless rewards for you inshaallah  utaz badr

the worse i am the more i need god i cant shut myself out from his mercy that is what it would mean starting a life with you without him

with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible matthew

faith is not the clinging to a shrine but an endless pilgrimage of the heart

tradition is the living faith of the dead traditionalism is the dead faith of the living and i suppose i should add it is traditionalism that gives tradition such a bad name

i decided i would fill the emptiness in me with god and with paint

you can’t confuse childlike faith with childish thinking

but what really matters is not what you believe but the faith and conviction with which you believe…

the bible is the greatest of all books to study it is the noblest of all pursuits to understand it the highest of all goals

i have always been a firm believer in god and the power of prayer though to be honest my faith has made for alist of questions i definitely want answered after im gone

all religions are based on obsolete terminology

im not a wiccan im not big on churches of any kind despite the fact that ive spoken facetoface with an archangel of the almighty

faith is about what you do its about aspiring to be better and nobler and kinder than you are its about making sacrifices for the good of otherseven when theres not going to be anyone telling you what a hero you are

faith is a power of its own and one even more elusive and difficult to define than magic

maybe thats why life is so precious no rewind or fast forwardjust patience and faith

with faith there are no questions without faith there are no answers

faith in god is an opening up a letting go a deep trust a free act of love  but sometimes it was so hard to love

find what you want i will find you

though wrong gratifies in the moment good yields its gifts over a lifetime

omnipotentbenevolent simply means that god is allpowerful and wellmeaning

i understand the concept its just    there seems to be a contradiction

yes the contradiction is pain mans starvation war sickness

the camerlengo frowned would he

do you have children lieutenant

chartrand flushed no signore

imagine you had an eightyearold son    would you love him

would you let him skateboard

chartrand did a double take the camerlengo always seemed oddly in touch for a clergyman yeah i guess chartrand said sure id let him skateboard but id tell him to be careful

so as this childs father you would give him some basic good advice and then let him go off and make his own mistakes

i wouldnt run behind him and mollycoddle him if thats what you mean

but what if he fell and skinned his knee

he would learn to be more careful

the camerlengo smiled so although you have the power to interfere and prevent your childs pain you would choose to show your love by letting him learn his own lessons

of course pain is part of growing up its how we learn

the camerlengo nodded exactly

faith—is the pierless bridge

supporting what we see

unto the scene that we do not—

too slender for the eye

it bears the soul as bold

as it were rocked in steel

with arms of steel at either side—

it joins—behind the veil

to what could we presume

the bridge would cease to be

to our far vacillating feet

god made you the way he wanted you to be and he does not make mistakes he has a plan for your life that is much bigger than you can imagine

i’ve learned that no matter how inspired fired up and motivated you might be the dark clouds will always set in

the man who has faith in logic is always cuckolded by reality

it is not great faith but true faith that saves and the salvation lies not in the faith but in the christ in whom faith trustsit is not the measure of faith but the sincerity of faith which is the point to be considered

true friends dont come with conditions

wings are like dreams before each flight a bird takes a small jump a leap of faith believing that its wings will work that jump can only be made with rock solid feet

god never talks but the devil keeps advertising father the devil does a lot of commercials

peace has to be created in order to be maintained it is the product of faith strength energy will sympathy justice imagination and the triumph of principle it will never be achieved by passivity and quietism

for if theres no everlasting god theres no such thing as virtue and theres no need of it

your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life keep going tough situations build strong people in the end

and when is enough proof enough

i love you was his reply i make myself keep on loving you despite what you do ive got to love you we all have to love you and believe in

you and think you are looking out for our best interests but look at us momma and really see us

grace will follow us even when we are going the wrong way

we cant believe what we believe to be untrue and we cant love what we believe to be unreal

christianity is not about how much faith you have its about who your faith is in

where you find truth

is where you find your reflection

and where you find your reflection

is where you find love

and where you find love

is where you find light

and where you find light

is where you find faith

and where you find faith

is where you find purpose

and where you find purpose

is where you find happiness

and where you find happiness

is where you find truth

and when you find truth

truth will set you free

some people are angels sent to you by god at your weakest moments

perhaps there is supranatural reason beyond the normal definitions of fact or databased logic something that only makes sense if you can see a bigger picture of reality maybe that is where faith fits in

i move not without thy knowledge

loss is only temporary when you believe in god

true devotion and humility is when you carelessly allow yourself to fall in love with things you consider will make you look inferior which in essence makes you superior

but we have seen how brightly light shines in the dark how sweetly music fills the quiet all these years you have known only shadow and silence and we have so much to show you to save you

i am not worth saving

we are all worth saving

how can you know

we cannot ever know not truly

but we have faith

never doubt god in the darkness what he has given us in the light

im only a tool beloved not your savior

on every level of life from housework to heights of prayer in all judgment and efforts to get things done hurry and impatience are sure marks of the amateur

when he says we’re forgiven let’s unload the guilt when he says we’re valuable let’s believe him    when he says we’re provided for let’s stop worrying god’s efforts are strongest when our efforts are useless

the greatest joys in life are found not only in what we do and feel but also in our quiet hopes and labors for others

for dear me why abandon a belief

merely because it ceases to be true

common sense is no match for the voice of god

how do you know itll be pleasurable he got on the bed and lay down

breath a whisper she came closer and tied one wrist to the headboard the cat growled but didnt try to make him wrench free

because just looking at you gives me the most extreme pleasure ive ever felt

christ baby tie me up before you start talking like that

for me the most radical demand of christian faith lies in summoning the courage to say yes to the present risenness of jesus christ

faith doesnt get you around problems in life and relationships it gets you through it

god will bring the right person into your life at the right time always believe that if they are not there god isnt finished yet

to learn a belief without the belief is to sing a song without the tune

fear tries to get us to give up but faith takes us all the way through to victory

god is the ultimate judge of what is truly in our souls but we are requiered to forgive everyone

failure is just another way to learn how to do something right

faith never stays put its always challenging always questioning thats what makes it real

and remember this most of all when it is darkest that is when you can see the stars most clearly

elder mocked me for praying once and i spent an hour berating him for that he ended up throwing up his hands laughing and telling me i could believe whatever i wanted if i was going to hold onto my beliefs so hard

a phenomenon often seen a sceptic adhering to a believer that is as simple as the law of the complementary colours what we lack attracts us nobody loves the light like the blind man

i think i should get love inked on my skin

maybe thats the only way i am destined to keep it

i say to myself who are you to measure infinite power

god is so immense that if he were too visible people would give forced compliance without expressing their heart so god made it possible in enormous love for us to live as if he were not there

any situation circumstance or challenge is just a distraction and as you remain true to your goals and trust in god they will fall away

he is cured by faith who is sick of fate

on the subject of who is to blame for our disunity  the easy conclusion that

the devil is at work trying to destroy the church is true but itʼs not the whole story of

course the enemy is at work doing that but closer examination shows that much of

the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the church itselfon believers in godand

how our own devilish deeds have alienated other followers of god sadly weʼve done

the devilʼs work for him

faith in its most correct form never removes responsibility it removes fear of responsibility the results are complete opposites with the greater saying gods will is my delight

science only goes so far then comes god

the desire for a strong faith is not the proof of a strong faith rather the opposite if one has it one may permit oneself the beautiful luxury of skepticism one is secure enough fixed enough for it

my lack of faith in god is not a dilapidated house

it does not need to be razed to the ground or burned down to cinders

i refuse to be the wounded woman on a cross

that you crucify with your disapproval like nails

i will only be the woman who believes in thunderstorms

the same way lightning loves the tops of trees it strikes

every time it gets tired of being pent up in an unforgiving sky

the only difference is that i believe these are natural weather phenomenons

not god’s belly rumbling or synapses firing

when my doorway is filled with groups of people

i will be the martyr who steps aside to let the arrows

crack through the plaster in my wall instead of piercing my chest

this is not a eulogy to the believer i could have been

this is a battle cry to the believer i always have been

after old nights spent drowning in despair believer

in love as an entire language instead of a single word

just because my beliefs align themselves on a different spectrum

does not mean they are the wrong wavelength or color

and even though i think the universe was created by the big bang

instead of a god with magic dust shooting from his fingertips

my universe does not contain fewer stars

let us here observe that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation

the truth of our faith becomes a matter of ridicule among the infidels if any catholic not gifted with the necessary scientific learning presents as dogma what scientific scrutiny shows to be false

knowledge absolutely sure of its infallibility is faith

the problem with certainty is that it is static it can do little but endlessly reassert itself uncertainty by contrast is full of unknowns possibilities and risks

what is seen is not the truth

what is cannot be said

trust comes not without seeing

nor understanding without words

the wise comprehends with knowledge

to the ignorant it is but a wonder

some worship the formless god

some worship his various forms

in what way he is beyond these attributes

only the knower knows

that music cannot be written

how can then be the notes

say kabir awareness alone will overcome illusion

he must trust and he must have faith and so he builds because what is building and rebuilding and rebuilding again but an act of faith

george macdonald gives me renewed strength during times of troubletimes when i have seen people tempted to deny godwhen he says the son of god suffered unto death not that men might not suffer but that their sufferings might be like his

god wants to dance with us the goal of dancing is not to learn the steps the goal of dancing is to enjoy your partner we learn the steps but only so we dont have to look down at our feet we are free to look into the eyes of the one we love

and now we step to the rhythm of miracles

from the light that never dies

faith gaped at himhow the hell did you do this

he looked at her as if shed asked the dumbest question in history im brilliant

all was in gods plan and he had to accept even as he didnt understand

you’ll only fall if you doubt your balance

faith can move mountains so why are you stumbling on a little rock

we pray for the big things and forget to give thanks for the ordinary small and yet really not small gifts

as the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom so the denial of god is the height of foolishness

even now there are still days so beautiful i almost believe in god

maybe if you cant get someone out of your head they were never meant to leave perhaps they were meant to help change you into the person you have been waiting to become

faith is the cure that heals all troubles without faith there is no hope and no love faith comes before hope and before love sheikh muhammad ibn zaidi bani tihama

it is better to dwell on the beautiful things in life than the negative

hardships are the lords greatest blessings to the believer without them we would love the lord only for what he does for us our troubles teach us to love him for who he is sister norton in the preachers bride

without the voice of reason every faith is its own curse

history will teach us nothing

faith is not something that goes against the evidence it goes beyond it the evidence is saying to us there is another country there is something beyond mere reason

the doing of something productive regardless of the outcome is an act of faith the doing of a small something when a large something is too much for us is perhaps especially an act of faith faith means going forward by whatever means we can

every beginner possesses a great potential to be an expert in his or her chosen field

in seven days god had created the earth in a single day mankind had turned it upside down

to be honest with you i dont have the words to make you feel better but i do have the arms to give you a hug ears to listen to whatever you want to talk about and i have a heart a heart thats aching to see you smile again

lines from love vs destiny

for i think belief in god is not a matter of reason at all i think it finally is a matter of love

without being push to the wall we will have remained in our comfortable zone but this circumstance challenges us to find the courage to move on

bombs have killradiuses churches should have loveradiusesanyone within twenty miles of a church should know it

break my heart for what breaks yours

everything i am for your kingdoms cause

as i walk from earth into eternity

even if things arent going the way we want right now we will always get through it

this is the story of how dad lived with his lung cancer but it is much more through his illness and the miracles we experienced i came to see that dads was not just a journey it was a journey home home to god

as long as we remain vigilant at building our internal abundance—an abundance of integrity an abundance of forgiveness an abundance of service an abundance of love—then external lack is bound to be temporary

and if there is no god

blake said most of us mix up god and satan he said that what most people think is god is merely prudence and the restrainer and inhibitor of energy which results in fear and passivity and imaginative death

direct my sail

the prophet muhammad peace be upon him said when allah loves a people he tries them

because a gift can never stop being a gift

it is always meant to be given

those who have loved are those that have found god

i cant make those two realities  what ive lost and what ive found  fit together in some tidy pattern of divine causality i just have to hold them on the one hand and on the other just like that

ive got my own moral compass to steer by

a guiding star beats a spirit in the sky

and all the preaching voices

empty vessels ring so loud

as they move among the crowd

in the temple and market place

like a stone in the river

against the floods of spring

i will quietly resist

like the willows in the wind

or the cliffs along the ocean

i will quietly resist

like a flower in the desert

that only blooms at night

i will quietly resist

flowers dont tell they show thats the way good books should be toostephanie skeem author of flotsam

a faith that does not result in activity of any kind is a dead faith it is empty worthless insincere

a faith that hasnt been tested cant be trusted

it takes years and maturity to make the discovery that the power of faith is nobler than the power of doubt and that there is a celestial wisdom in the ingenuous propensity to trust which belongs to honest and noble natures

there is very little of this crude weltanschauung that is not shared to some degree by the multitudes today especially among the young who feel themselves enlightened and liberated very little that is not typically modern

if you can admit that you havent yet understood everything

faith can fill the emptiness in heart to confront the hesitation

our age could be characterized as a manifold experiment in faithlessness and if it has as yet produced no effective understanding of the practicalities of faith it has certainly produced massive evidence of the damage and disorder of its absence

pg the body and the earth

lakewalker legends say the gods abandoned the world when the first malice came and that they will return when the earth is entirely cleansed of its spawn if you believe in gods

do you

i believe they are not here yes its a faith of sorts

hope and faith underlie a promise

and love energizes men to realize it

faith is always supposed to make it harder not easier to ignore the plight of our sisters and brothers p

for liberty is an acknowledgment of faith in god and his works

i remember the day i started thinking this it was such a revelation to me it was the day my mother lost her faith in god she found that things of unquestioned certainty could never be trusted again

in tough and desperate times when your creativity begs to be birthed loose the confines of the ground stand up in your faith and walk atop the waves…

antiintellectualism remains strongly entrenched in many parts of the church but it is grounded in fear not in faith p

sil nexistait pas dieu il faudrait linventer if god did not exist he would have to be invented

the only sweeter than union is reunion

as i ponder my pilgrim’s progress to orthodoxy however i realize that i didn’t make the trip alone but in a twoseater and i wasn’t the one driving

people have a hunger to experience the spectacular but the lord is supernatural

i prefer a world with many beliefs and religions

it stimulates my faith to keep growing day by day

my purpose is what lord where lord when lord yes lord

as far as god goes i am a nonbeliever still am but when it comes to a devilwell thats something else

it’s the ‘everyday’ experiences we encounter along the journey to who we wanna be that will define who we are when we get there

that faith be analyzable does not necessarily imply a method for getting by without it

its as if you think youd never find

reason and the sacred intertwined

hit aint sacrilege miss effie belle says when she caint think what to have for dinner she asts god and right off he gives her an idea to my thinkin thets sacrilege

miss love really laughed theres not a woman in the world who hasnt prayed what to cook for dinner rucker

faith doesnt have to be much not any bigger than a mustard seed that small only that much faith youll need in me god says because i am so big i am the great i am so have faith in me

some are professors and others are possessors

the greatest hindrance to growth in faith is comfortable living

stand like a beaten anvil when thy dream

is laid upon thee golden from the fire

flinch not though heavily through that furnacegleam

the black forgehammers fall on thy desire

demoniac giants round thee seem to loom

tis but the worldsmiths heaving to and fro

stand like a beaten anvil take the doom

their ponderous weapons deal thee blow on blow

needful to truth as dewfall to the flower

is this wild wrath and this implacable scorn

for every pang new beauty and new power

burning bloodred shall on thy heart be born

stand like a beaten anvil let earths wrong

beat on that iron and ring back in song

if you saturate your mind with positive thoughts it will sustain you in any situation

may you find the strength of will and the grace of endurance to overcome every challenge

with positive attitude you can graciously overcome every adversity

love as content is in the habit of limiting formal patterns the same goes for faith after all there are only so many adequate manifestations for truly strong sentiments which in the end is what explains rituals

it is not what happens to you it is what happens in you

i dont believe in your god and he sure as hell doesnt believe in me

dream big wake up take the first step into the unknown

wherever you are you can pray

in any situation there is a sacredsolution

there are things that will happen to you and there is nothing you can do about this isnt it exciting beyond belief

easily mistaken it is not about a love for adversity it is about knowing a strength and a faith so great that adversity in all its adverse manifestations hardly even exists

faith has won it fear has lost it when you get full of faith the devil gets filled with fear keep your faith in light every day and you will keep the devil in fright always

but youd get arguments from all kinds of people that the bible has got to be perfect that god would not permit such errors to be made in the holy word

i thought god gave everyone free will which would presumably  and evidently  include the freedom to be incorrect when translating one language into another

stop making me think im believing over here

keep the faith the vision is always for the appointed time be patient prayerful and wait for the fulfillment of your visions

and i dont believe you dead how can you be dead if i still feel you maybe like god you changed into something different that ill have to speak to in a different way but you not dead to me nettie and never will you be

sometimes we can focus so much on nothing that we make it a big something of nothing

there are many faiths but the spirit is one — in me and in you and in him so that if everyone believes himself all will be united everyone be himself and all will be as one

when the door of opportunity of your storehouse opens for you let faith and hope enter first when your faith leads the way you will locate the source of your hidden treasures

many were the steps taken in doubt that saw their shapeless ends in no time those who travail in faith today will truimph in joy tomorrow let faith lead the way

the religionist is a living fossil embedded in that rock called faith

proverbs  the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding

she had walked to the brink abandoning all belief and just before the bitter end she was pulled from the abyss by faith

faith is a process of leaping into the abyss not on the basis of any certainty about where we shall land but rather on the belief that we shall land

faith is the choice of the nobler hypothesis not the noblest one never knows what that is but the nobler the best one can see when the choice is made

google facebook helps people than people helps people in todays world

life is the only thing which can never be replaced when lost

holding on to the past will hold you down in life learn from it but move on

pious people spoke to god and crazy people imagined that god spoke back

challenge the church to do better be more of who christ wants us to be

no matter how hard it is or how hard it gets dont ever ever ever lose hope

all i know is that the closer i get to god the deeper i get into the bible and the heavier the burden seems on my shoulders

faith was the excuse you used if you didnt have a good argument

when comprehending how different people truly are you also comprehend the absolute necessity of some divine authority

hope is magic hope is a gift hope is a raft we cling to in the midst of a storm hope by nature is an independent of logic hope is power outside of the facts

the human mind longs for something better hope is not rational yet who need rationality when god is on our side the capacity of hope is the most significant fact in life

they all believed in him because of the authenticity of his musical talent and his faith in it

a man has to have something he can put faith in cant you see that what i want is someone that will love me she would have me and i her otherwise a man may just go hang himself

there are six reasons anyone does anything love faith greed boredom fear he said ticking them off on his fingers but he lingered on the last drawing a deep breath before he said revenge

there is nothing like suspense and anxiety for barricading a humans mind against the enemy he wants men to be concerned with what they do our business is to keep them thinking about what will happen to them

god i am trying to recover my faith please dont abandon me in the middle of

this adventure i prayed pushing my fears aside

god tests but he does not tempt

logic cannot comprehend love so much the worse for logic

sometimes new opportunity means new opposition not everything god asks us to do will be comfortable

faith is stepping out into the unknown with nothing to guide us but a hand just beyond our grasp

there was a time when skepticism was an act of rebellion since to a degree i both believe in evolution and have faith i can only conclude that as prophesied to have faith will someday be an act of rebellion

in the desert the only god is a well

celebrating faith over reason is merely a way of denying what is in favor of embracing any whim that strikes your fancy

faith is stronger than socalled reason

comparing yourself to others does nothing for you society has conditioned us to value people who fit a secular mold of perfection

it takes faith to find personal significance in your relationship with god rather than how much money you earn how beautiful you look how many toys you own how many trophies you collect or how much territory you conquer and control

there are no atheists in the foxhole

little faith sees gods hand in great things established faith sees gods hand in little things

give up isnt going to help

keep going on will help

on the concept of unity thatʼs rightjesusʼ most pressing concern before

leaving the earth was our unity he was looking ahead to every generation of

believer and as he prayed he made it clear that our witness as his body in this

fractured  messedup chaotic world would depend on our love for another

addressing the concept of man made additions to the faith  these additions

standards practices and allegiances supposedly created for our spiritual beneﬁt

have had the opposite effect

just because you cant see something doesnt mean its not there

in essence we are deeper than being we are character which contains the conscious forces of love justice kindness faith and forgiveness

its because we have little faith that we look within instead of without

he is the light in my life and the rock beneath my feet referring to the lord jesus

two natures beat within my breast

the one is foul the one is blessed

the one i love the one i hate

the one i feed will dominate

i started having doubts right on top of my certainty

love and respect all people hate and destroy all faith

our duty is found in the revealed will of god in the scriptures our trust must be in the sovereign will of god as he works in the ordinary circumstances of our daily lives for our good and his glory

through the darkest hours of the night

and through the dreamers realm i seek

far beyond the starry sky

and beyond galaxies i am free

through the grimmest memories

and past a seasons air i cannot breathe

far beyond this mortal world

in an afterlife we shall meet

the more you delve into science the more it appears to rely on faith

prayer is the quiet persistent living of our life of desire and faith in the presence of our god

in all my travels ive never seen a countrys population more determined to forgive and to build and succeed than in rwanda

i see now that my faith was becoming an ally rather than an enemy because i could vent anger freely even toward god without fearing retribution

the back door of every tomb opens on a hilltop

things which are accidentally the causes either of hope or fear are called good or evil omens

faith is the poetry of our dreams action is the builder of our reality

surprisingly the christian faith today is perceived as disconnected from the supernatural world – a dimension that the vast majority of outsiders believe can be accessed and influenced

faith is the mortar that fills the cracks in the evidence and the gaps in the logic and thus it is faith that keeps the whole terrible edifice of religious certainty still looming dangerously over our world

the only truth was whatever you could make someone believe

it seems we are all too vulnerable to having our heart lead us astray from what is right

every christian should be both conservative and radical conservative in preserving the faith and radical in applying it

it is not as a child that i believe and confess jesus christ my hosanna is born of a furnace of doubt

stories are verbal acts of hospitality

faith may want answers but somehow it is able to survive without them

faith is not knowledge of an object but communion with it

the bird of paradise alights only upon the hand that does not grasp

the only real fall of man is his noneucharistic life in a noneucharistic world

the beauty of catholicism is every human beings right

god gives us not only the truth but also the ability to believe it not only the new thing to see but also the new eye to see it with

to make a man a saint it must indeed be by grace and whoever doubts this does not know what a saint is or a man

waiting is an exercise of faith that demonstrates the condition of our hearts waiting on god is an act of faith and faith is what separates the men from the boys

ezekial saw the wheel

way up in the middle of the air

o ezekial saw the wheel

way in the middle of the air

now the big wheel runs by faith

and the little wheel runs by the grace of god

fidelity is a living breathing entity on wobbly footing it can wander becoming something different entirely

i’m losing faith in my favorite country

then everything changed

please dont take my wings

i look for a sign where to go next you never know when youll get one even the most faithless among us are waiting to be proven wrong

great faith overcomes laws of nature that govern physical world

we are not to be occupied with our feelings or symptoms

or our faith or lack of faith

but only with what god has said

the top  of the people who are most creative constructive and thoughtful do not have much to do with churches to them the canons of reason come first making faith secondary and questionable

faith without a measure of doubt aint worth a brass farthin

i open my heart to her and lay it on the table

spiritual victory is not something you earn  it is something you accept the christian life is not so much about what you have done  its about what christ has done its not so much about how strong you are  its about how strong god is

we have very little faith in the lord very little trust if we trusted the lord as much as we trust a friend when we ask him to do something for us neither we as individuals nor our whole country would suffer so much

but no this cannot be true it is not for nothing it is not meaningless that all over the world is displayed the high and towering authority of the christian faith

unless there is within us that which is above us we shall soon yield to that which is about us

what the hell are you getting so upset about he asked her bewilderedly in a tone of contrite amusement i thought you didnt believe in god

i dont she sobbed bursting violently into tears but the god i dont believe in is a good god a just god a merciful god hes not the mean and stupid god you make him out to be

men will trust in god no further than they know him and they cannot be in the exercise of faith in him one ace further than they have a sight of his fulness and faithfulness in exercise

nothing will unfold for us unless we move toward what

looks to us like nothing faith is a cascade

the pure perfect truth of life is that we are here to create heaven on earth to bring the perfection of what is above down to us and in doing so to become transformed as human being into something great and beautiful

perhaps it is our obligation to be noble before it is our obligation to be happy

dignity and even holiness too sometimes are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine

i feel no need for any other faith than my faith in human beings

promise has faith as premise

only men of faith can promise

doubter wants proof which contributes nothing to her faith

some things have to be believed to be seen

faith reveals the potential

god blesses to the degree in which you believe

the question is not who uses faith and who uses reason everyone uses both the question instead should be who has the most reasonable faith

a faith to live by a self to live with and a purpose to live for

just think of what would have happened to poor old naaman if he had decided to dunk himself only once

judged by the normal standards of human affairs the lives of men and women of god may look overburdened with suffering and even inconclusive

it seems to me some people just go around lookin to get their faith unsettled that has been the fashion for the last hundred years or so

you just dont have faith frank repeated

well i hope i never get it its like being hit by a hammer in the head

we have not reached the consensus that to eat is a basic human right this is an ethical crisis this is a crisis of faith

the unqualified affirmation of the univeral will of salvation has radically changed the way of conceiving the mission of the church in the world    the work of salvation is a reality which occurs in history

why then should witless man so much misweene

that nothing is but that which he hath seene

if i were a character in one of my books id be the optimistic one believing the best and urging others to do the same

theres no guarantee of disasterfree in any world religion

but love faith and knowledge give men hope and willpower

what is the basic difference between saying i know that god exists and saying i know that love exists

with god brokenness is nothing more than the stage upon which the impossible is about to happen

he felt god the same way arthritic monks felt rain coming in their joints he felt only a hint of him

i have lost the consolation of faith though not the ambition to worship

true love asks no questions makes no reservations but puts itself unconditionally into the hands of the loved one

instead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience of man at rest forever thou didst choose all that is exceptional vague and enigmatic

if you want to fly grow wings of faith

consider it all joy my brothers and sisters when you encounter various trials for you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance

whoever survived cruel situations finds the strength of obedient faith

answers based in truth are the foundation of wisdom

when you want to go up that mountain and everyone else around you is telling you that is too hard and you’ll never going to make it please listen to that small voice inside your heart and one day you will reach the mountain top

each man should be free to fight for his own salvation

if you want something work for it prayer is superfantstic faith is mwah but work is necessary and important so work for what you want

your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a selfillusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone

above all trust in the slow work of god

so you say faith is not enough for you and you want knowledge too but knowledge does not involve spiritual effort knowledge is obvious faith assumes effort knowledge is repose and faith is motion

i am for

one world without fear and corruption

one world ruled by truth and justice

i am for

one peaceful world for all

where hate has been overcome by love

and everyone is guided only

by their conscience

is it possible to love someone so completely so intensely they could never die to give them more than just your heart or your soul what if you could give then the miracle of immortality

service to humanity is service to god

sometimes we place faith in the wrong people for the right reasons were too blind to their faults and theyre too blind to appreciate us

belief in immortality is harmful because it is not in our power to conceive of the soul as really incorporeal so this belief is in fact a belief in the prolongation of life and it robs death of its purpose

how did you merit so much devotion so quickly i asked making no attempt to keep the sarcasm from my voice

i show them heaven said she without a trace of irony people are so desperate for light

your little choices become habits that affect the bigger decisions you make in life

god will save whomever he chooses to save the christian should proselytize not because he thinks he can change everybody he should proselytize because the gospel being shared is the ultimate act of love because he thinks he can love everybody

don’t believe negative voices listen to the divineinstinct of awaken soul

first knowledge is the knowledge of god

endure to the very end

you can use the stumbling blocks to build your success

great achievement requires personal force determined spirit and selfconfidence

if one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child then one million of you are a million times guilty

i have to serve with all my might

the greatest obsession is i believe in myself

but god does give us responsibility and it takes biblical faith to do those things in dependence on god

faith changes us  faith in something intrinsically good something other than ourselves something bigger than ourselves

be strong

no crime is a means to an end no crime can be rationalized

faith without any actions in accordance with god’s will is a dead faith

joyfully we undertake our daily work

i saw that although they were at the mercy of the sweltering heat or the pains of aging or poverty they could tolerate these because their faith gave them the hope of being united in spirit with a supernatural presence

if one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty

you have to appreciate where you have come from to know who you are in the present and whom you would like to be in the future

you are the ruler of my heart there is no measure greater than this

never surrender to youre passions dream and live to excess

you never know who youre inspiring or uninspiring people notice more than you think

have you ever tried thinking of god as a person instead of an allpowerful vending machine that never gives you the right amount of change he has feelings too you know

i live to inspire not start the fire

totally present in this moment for you

yeah but you didnt know that id recited how i felt for you right then in that moment in my mins the words flowed silently so easily theres no mistaking them when i gave you those kisses i was telling myself and you

he peck my nose i

he kisses my forehead love

my heart swells as

he presses his lips to my chin then he whispers  you

maybe heaven entailed more than a soul residing in a single place but instead having pieces of yourself spread among the hearts and memories of people youve touched

pray for change in your heart and not your circumstance and you will see what will happen

girls aside the other thing i found in the last few years of being at school was a quiet but strong christian faith – and this touched me profoundly setting up a relationship or faith that has followed me ever since

i am so grateful for this it has provided me with a real anchor to my life and has been the secret strength to so many great adventures since

but it came to me very simply one day at school aged only sixteen

as a young kid i had always found that a faith in god was so natural it was a simple comfort to me unquestioning and personal

but once i went to school and was forced to sit through somewhere in the region of nine hundred dry latinliturgical chapel services listening to stereotypical churchy people droning on i just thought that i had got the whole faith deal wrong

maybe god wasn’t intimate and personal but was much more like chapel was … tedious judgemental boring and irrelevant

the irony was that if chapel was all of those things a real faith is the opposite but somehow and without much thought i had thrown the beautiful out with the boring if church stinks then faith must do too

the precious natural instinctive faith i had known when i was younger was tossed out with this newly found delusion that because i was growing up it was time to ‘believe’ like a grownup

i mean what does a child know about faith

it took a low point at school when my godfather stephen died to shake me into searching a bit harder to refind this faith i had once known

life is like that sometimes it takes a jolt to make us sit and remember who and what we are really about

i was devastated

i remember sitting up a tree one night at school on my own and praying the simplest most heartfelt prayer of my life

blow me down … he did

to me my christian faith is all about being held comforted forgiven strengthened and loved – yet somehow that message gets lost on most of us and we tend only to remember the religious nutters or the god of endless school assemblies

this is no one’s fault it is just life our job is to stay open and gentle so we can hear the knocking on the door of our heart when it comes

this really is the heart of what i found as a young teenager christ comes to make us free to bring us life in all its fullness he is there to forgive us where we have messed up and who hasn’t and to be the backbone in our being

faith in christ has been the great empowering presence in my life helping me walk strong when so often i feel so weak it is no wonder i felt i had stumbled on something remarkable that night up that tree

i had found a calling for my life

i dont think theres anything wrong with borrowing someone elses faith to get you through until you get enough on your own

i once heard a chicagoarea pastor put it this way we dont need more americans bowing down to the democrat donkey or the republican elephant we need more americans bowing down to the lion of judah

pray each morning and each night

talk to god and be polite

tell him what youre grateful for

leave your troubles at his door

share your wishes needs and hopes

ask god how to bravely cope

tell him all you learned today

say the things you need to say

beg forgiveness for your sins

pray to live with him again

speak with earnest heart and soul

he will listen this i know

for prayer is hope put to the test

and hope is faith in what is best

faith is power to do great things

thus prayer is faiths enabling wings

i am the chosen of the lord for who he loveth so doeth he chastiseth but i be durn if he dont take some curious ways to show it seems like

by telling you anything at all im at least believing in you i believe youre there i believe you into being because im telling you this story i will your existence i tell therefore you are

no rain cant get the rainbow

i reckon it does take a powerful trust in the lord to guard a fellow though sometimes i think that cora’s a mite overcautious like she was trying to crowd the other folks away and get in closer than anybody else

what we really need is only a heart of surrender  always trust what god has plan for our life so we do our best god shall take the rest thats what i called faith

spiritual joy is what you experience when you choose to give thanks to god no matter what happens—even when things go wrong

the door wasn’t closing shiloh’s spirit opened up as she considered the possibilities

i have wandered freely in mystical traditions that are not religious and have been profoundly influenced by them it is my church however that i keep returning for she is my spiritual home

the good news does not hinge on words like do or change but on the powerless irrelevant and frightening words like belief and faith

i have lost my faith but i gained the truth it is not important at all to lose your candle as long as you find a torch

they cried yes yes they cried cried more tears than the mississippi could hold but those tears never washed away their faith…

never shall i forget that night the first night in camp that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed

never shall i forget that smoke

never shall i forget the small faces of the children whose bodies i saw transformed into smoke under a silent sky

never shall i forget those flames that consumed my faith forever

never shall i forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live

never shall i forget those moments that murdered my god and my soul and turned my dreams to ashes

never shall i forget those things even were i condemned to live as long as god himself

when we do the hard intimate work of friendship we bring a little more of the divine into daily life

if you allow it suffering can be the means by which god brings you his greatest blessings

deep contended joy comes from a place of complete security and confidence in god  even in the midst of trial

people often speak of hell not wanting to go there avoiding itetc i never had that problem because hell is a state of mind look around you rape murder wars hatred envymy friend youre already there

the size of a challenge should never be measured by what we have to offer it will never be enough furthermore provision is gods responsibility not ours we are merely called to commit what we have  even if its no more than a sack lunch

god never calls his people to accomplish anything without promising to supply their every need

nobody think about that broken heart life goes on broken heart never join together but it tries very hard to get joined again thatswhy may be it said heart is like a mirror if its broken can never be joined

nature is bent on new beginning

and death has not a chance of winning

the crisis of physical hunger is essentially a crisis of faith what or whom will you trust to meet your most basic needs will you trust the god who made human bodies or will you seek your own way deuteronomy

to require god to prove that he is able and willing to fulfill his promises would be proof positive that one does not trust him

boldness in the course of a noble fight is worth the riskif you stand on truth youll only regret your timidity later but youll never regret being bold

its not enough merely to believe there is a god you must believe in the god who is there

faith itself cannot accomplish anything yet without faith no one can fly

sin may have the power to kill and destroy but god is the creator of life he can create it from nothing and he can restore it from deathjohn

worse still he doesn’t know how to follow the piper anymore because it’s a path tom has lost faith in

and the piper knows it tom can see it in his father’s eyes now and the more he stares the clearer it becomes

faith is a question of eyesight even the blind can see that

its still easier to find the correct hoover bag than to find one pure person one pure faith on the globe

truth without love isnt

deepen your faith in yourself

nothing will be able

to frighten or weaken you

i lose faith in mathematics logical and rigid what with those that even zero doesn’t accept

as to the doubt of the soul i discover it to be false a mood not a conclusion my conclusion is the faith corporate organized a personality teaching a thing not a theory it

hope is like a word made with cloud without faith it quickly blows away

jesus lets us be real with our life and our faith

they tried to believe in their classmates they must have believed that if we could all get together then we might end up being saved we should commend them for that we couldnt do that

we need to stop plotting the course and instead just land the plane on our plans to make a difference by getting to the do part of faith

before god and high heaven is there a law for one man which is not a law for every other man

of all the religions in the world perhaps the religion of liberty is the only faith capable of purity

why do many believers insist on repeatedly pointing to the crimes of th century dictators who led officially atheistic societies as some sort of evidence of their gods existence it makes no sense

i prayed to a mystery

praying into a bank of fog requires alot of effort i wanted an image to focus on when i prayed i wanted something to pray to but i couldnt go back to that old man he was too closely associated with all id left behind

maybe i am everything i knew that i would never be i looked back at jay and smiled

i would stand there at times and remember how beautiful god created this world and then i would be reassured that he would certainly take care of me and all of my loved ones

the father is truly the only promise maker who is in earnest a promise keeper a promise from god is a promise kept

but if i could just get som ehint some sign

conchita smiles without humor but with great affection thats the point behind faith she says its not something you can provei know you hate to hear this but you either have it or you dont

he who has two grounds of trust is lost he who relies upon two

salvations and cannot say of christ he is all my salvation and all my desire that man is not only in danger of being

lost but he is already condemned because in fact he believes not on the son of god he is not alive to god at all but rests partly on the cross and then in some measure on something else

but the witness of the substitutionary atonement of jesus is that gods most difficult promise has been kept

so it goes for those of us who live in a culdesac where babies are brought home from the hospital and watched over where hearts stop and feet slip where we wonder if there is a hidden road that leads somewhere

we believe and we doubt believing and doubting share the same inevitability but they are not equal they cannot lay the same claim on our allegiance they do not share the same power

if there are places beyond the culdesac doubt cannot take us there

god arranges everything for us so that we need have no more fear or trouble and may be quite sure that all things will come right in the end

you won’t ever get ahead if you keep feeling sorry for yourself you must stop all the negative talk and start thinking positive you have a lot of potential but your life won’t change until you change how you think

you are the hybrids of golden worlds and ages splendidly conceived

faith is a footbridge that you dont know will hold you up over the chasm until youre forced to walk out onto it

many of us christians have become extremely skillful in arranging our lives so as to admit the truth

of christianity without being embarrassed by its implications

a guilty suffering spirit is more open to grace than an apathetic or smug soul  bread  wine day

the cautious faith that never saws off a limb on which it is sitting never learns that unattached limbs may find strange unaccountable ways of not falling

strange are the pictures of the future that mankind can thus draw with this brush of faith and these manycoloured pigments of the imagination strange too that no one of them tallies with another

we strain to hear but instead of hearing an answer we catch sight of god himself scraped and torn through our tears we see the tears of god

if we require some kind of sign or proof for our belief in god then we believe or place our tust not in god but in the sign or proof

nature is another name for the miracles that are so commonplace in our lives that we take for granted and have grown used to seeing them

on faith’s battered back calm eyes etch prayers that cool a nation’s hot rage

i would rather believe god doesnt exist than believe he doesnt care

should one continue to follow the faith of a group thats cast him out shouldnt it stand to reason that if he was true to that faith that the group should have been true to him is it unreasonable to ask forgiveness of one who is allforgiving

faith which does not doubt is dead faith miguel de unamuno philosopher and writer

the two essential features of the emergence of stage  then are the critical distancing from ones previous assumptive value system and the emergence of the executive ego

we find that sometimes many persons complete half of this double movement but do not complete the other

what a failure her life had been would she have lied to god if she’d had more faith been more righteous how could she possibly have a son at her age and yet if she had believed all along

it seems all spirits need theatrics eh even christ himself requires incense and holy water were a skeptical people we need convincing

a belief which leaves no place for doubt is not a belief it is a superstition jose bergamin author

faith sir as to that matter i dont believe one half of it myself

if you believed in christianity or islam it was called faith but if you believed in astrology or friday the thirteenth it was superstition

i am not functioning very well living with the knowledge that the baby is dead is painful i feel so far away from you god i can only try to believe that you are sustaining me and guiding me through this please continue to stand by my side

we must look to marys example to know how to deal with the glorious impossibilities of god look how she turned the world upside down by making one simple statement

yes she believed god loved her but if this whole fiasco was his idea of love

trying to justify a world we dont hold all the answers to is what bedevils the best of us sometimes its better just to accept that things are as we see them

watching you has taught me that a man need not be weak to have a faith but is made strong by it

prophet he said your doctrines i do not know therefore if i accepted them i would do it out of fear like a coward and a base man are you anxious that your faith be professed by cowards and base people

logic only tells us whats there it cant really address what isnt even the most devoted empiricist must admit that we have no hope of understanding the universe some things are unknowable

as your faith is strengthened you will find that there is no longer the need to have a sense of control that things will flow as they will and that you will flow with them to your great delight and benefit

god is as real as a station wagon

we are in god’s hands we can’t come up with a surprise big enough or a sin vile enough to thwart his plan if we allow him to refine us we will inevitably end up free from the impurities that separate us from him

you were born into this life equipped to succeed you are a part of god’s perfect plan yes you the plan would not be perfect if you were missing think about that you matter more than you know

god is merciful cant we all be on the right track of faith but just using different roads

he who asserts belief with absolute certainty knows nothing of faith and makes himself into a fool he who is wise upon realizing they have done this recants and searches themselves for further enlightenment

faith can be interested in results only for a truth once recognized as such puts an end to the believers thinking

no human mind can fully grasp the gift of christ’s atonement the vastness and inclusiveness of the act—but in the end it comes down to just you and jesus you’ve come and he’s met you with open arms—and now it’s just between the two of you

cosette and jean valjean fell on their knees

they knew not what it was they knew not where they were but both of them the man and the child the penitent and the innocent felt that they must kneel

these voices had this strange characteristic that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted it was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house

while these voices were singing jean valjean thought of nothing he no longer beheld the night he beheld a blue sky it seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us unfolding

the song died away it may have lasted a long time jean valjean could not have told hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment

many things the gods achieve beyond our judgement said the sorrowful girl what we thought is not confirmed and what we thought not god contives

oh sometimes i like to put the sand of doubt into the oyster of my faith br cadfael

faith was something other than an intellectual exercise there were no words no lofty concepts that could take away the pain faith was living with the pain

and what about us is the way we feel about each other just simulated emotions from some biological process—nothing more

it took more than science to make hope real

from the short story the honorary shepherdsyou cant be kicked out of a faith faith starts inside your heart and ends up in eternity all you can be kicked out of is a building which is the bus stop of faith sort of and whats a building

they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint

religious sentiments are many a times much above reality all are aware of reality but blinded by faith and faith has always led to many a myths become reality

a life which has never been laid open in penitence and faith before god has little permanence in eternity

it consumes faithless human

as a general rule providence seldom vouchsafes to mortals any more than just that degree of encouragement which suffices to keep them at a reasonably full exertion of their powers

when i think of the crucifixion i commit the sin of envy

and whose rules will choose to you follow gods or mans you say you want to break the outmoded patterns and crate a new model then do it that is part of your destiny boy

in the beginning the call of god was not propositional it was experiential p

i believe in study i believe that men learn much through study as a matter of fact it has been my observation

that they learn little concerning things as they are as they were or as they are to come without study i also

believe however and know that learning by study is greatly accelerated by faith

if our future generations were much wilier than us

then it might be them who have led us all this time

to make decisions which fit to their preexistence

left us live in the world of uncertainty or by faith

this is the one who will find us hes the one who will lead them all back to me someday hes the explorer el curioso

what about you snipes dunbar asked you think there to be mountain lions up here or is it just folks imaginings

snipes pondered the question a few moments before speaking

like what dunbar asked

… all i’m saying is there is a lot more to this old world than meets the eye

… and darkness you can’t see it no more than you can see air but when its all around you sure enough know it serena

the outcome of the current crisis is already determined

the people who pray together build together a better world

duty performed gives clearness and firmness to faith and faith thus strengthened through duty becomes the more assured and satisfying to the soul

you dont need great faith to move mountains you only need to use the poor faith you say you have

faith he had learned that night in front of the flickering television was most glorious when it was most untouched by reason

prayer is not a wish turned heavenward  it is the voice of vail turned godward

when you’re outnumbered by trees your perspective shifts

you don’t have to wander around in silk robes burning sage with crystals tied to your head to find the power within

i believe in the possibility of everything

all people have the ability to feel for others through empathy

in dreams we accept truth much quicker than in the waking world

the golden rule applies to everyone not just the living

in a society of painkillers people seem to forget that pain has a purpose it is there to tell us when we’re ailing so we can pinpoint the issue and potentially alleviate it

you are a conductive being harness that power and transform it into something you love

if you live a happy full life and spread love and kindness wherever you go the naysayers will get drowned out by your light

people who are seeking emotional support find it in the craft because instead of looking to a savior or prophet we are taught to save ourselves

no matter how lightly a person steps they cannot avoid some tragedies

to be wholly selfaware one must give in to the unknown

a house is not defined by how many rooms or stories it has i always judge a place by what kind of energies it gives off

plants are the ultimate symbols of life

everyone’s journey is their own it would never be right of me to tell others what methods work best for them

what matters is that no matter how many times we fail ourselves we keep striving to do the things that keep us healthy and allow us to be happy

there is not one perfect being on this planet

the only thing a person has full power over is themselves and how they react to others and we don’t often have that

magic is not a cure for troubles it is a spiritual map your energies are the compass meditation will not fix a person it empowers individuals to find what they need to repair themselves

it’s amazing how something so simple can take hold of you and root itself into your character help you draw from it for years

i have always allowed the wind to blow me in the right direction

there is no sin nor wrong that gives man such a foretaste of hell in this life as anger and impatience

this is not my story of finding god this is my story about a god who did everything to find me

theres faith amid my bounded mysteries

i make messes god makes masterpieces and the difference is found in surrendering what i think i know to the god who knows without having to think

to live in faith is to live without regret

when you share your problems with man you get mansized solutions when you share your problems with god you get godsized solutions

could it be that it’s not a belief in god that’s absurd but rather it’s our perpetually limited understanding of god that’s really the thing that’s absurd

blind acceptance never leads to a solution at best it leads only to a standstill and is paid for heavily in the next generation

give yourself time to become everything you know you can be even the mighty oak was once just a seed

lessons come in all shapes and sizes sometimes as losses sometimes as mistakes

sometimes as painful relationships the goal of the teacher is not to make you fail

it is to make you grow into the stronger and wiser you

i have every reason to believe that all will be well because god loved me even when i didnt love myself

the day your demons awaken

aren’t you strong enough to walk alone we must each of us find god by ourselves

only when we truly know rest and celebration can we know how to work and enjoy it we work from rest not to get rest

liberation theology means challenging the stories that the authorities tell us about god especially if these stories have the same outcome for every single person

god has heard your prayers through every word every thought and every teardrop rest now in faith he knows best he knows all

to every soul you are special

so to every soul you are special

just when our understanding of god finally appears to have fallen comfortably into our childlike formulas god lets us know that he’s not two things a child or a formula

god doesnt hate you for what youve done wrong he loves you for what youre trying to do right

although anselm once famously and i think truthfully described the christian faith as a faith seeking understanding it seems to me that it can also be plausibly described at least for some persons as a faith seeking belief

belief is the activator of faith when you believe your good can be drawn to you then your faith moves it into expression

faith draws my good from the invisible to the visible

a queer spirituality allows for loving pandemoniumthe challenge of shifts and transitions the realization that we are shaped by each other and the emergence of new identities new creations within each relationship

faith needs conviction and insanity and most people require the latter

understand that i am already a christian

whereto he answered i will not believe it nor will i rank you among christians unless i see you in the church of christ

the other in banter replied do walls then make christians

belief in god messiah or some spiritual conartist is optional but belief in the self is imperative

fate is waiting she can heal she is unpredictable but not unkind

how in the world are we supposed to engage life when we spend all of our life building walls to protect ourselves from the very thing that we say we want to engage the answer is i think understanding that god doesn’t need walls but we need him

dont put your faith in gods but you can believe in turtles

religion is poetry the great abuse of religion is that so many should treat it like prose

if jesus is the model of perfect faith and his twin is thomas who models doubt then what we understand is that faith and doubt are not antitheses—they’re twins

if far from the force you find yourself trust you can that it is not the force which moved

who doesn’t know how

doubt lifts the hem of its nightgown

to reveal another inch of thigh

before the face of faith

we can only lose what isn’t ours anything that can be lost is never a loss anything that is ours can never be taken away

most hidden yet most present

true freedom lies in the battle to agree with the father’s will and to correspond to it

i don’t want to say that i believe in god rather i want to live out my life like i believe in god because that takes the words that i choose not to say and it shouts them without ever saying them

faith is to believe god will fulfill his word

god will always be god

faith is full assurance of gods faithfulness

to turn to god is to trust in his faithfulness

the unseen god sees every secret deed

każda wiara służyła człowiekowi tylko jako laska która podtrzymywała by nie upaść i pomagała wstać kiedy ludzie jednak się potykali i przewracali

faith that is firm is patient endurance

enduring faith is a firm foundation

tell god all your troubles

faith that is firm is also a patient endurance

faith that is firm is also patient peace

faith that is firm is also patient

faith in god is a firm fortress

salvation is not simply a matter of escaping the

world after death it is holistic and it is now and

too many christians have used this phrase im waiting on god to escape their lifes purpose and work in general some do nothing but wait on god from january to december but god doesnt work with waiters god works with doers movers and shakers

december st is only another day but the coming year can be a great blessing for you believe it youll enter the new year in victory  dele andersen

ceremony has become fraught with judgment the idea that whoever our god might be he requires absolute adherence to the way to the means of approach but those reactions are based on fear and theyre inaccurate

the kingdom of god is found within a man

faith is like a treasure hidden in a field

she wanted a new beginning so she opened the door and walked boldly into the unknown

my love is present wherever life takes you

whoever you are with and whatever you are doing

just close your eyes and think of me and i will be there

life has its plans that we mostly know nothing about

it takes away some people and brings to us others

sometimes we cant be where we would like to be where our heart is yearning to be with the ones we love so so much

we may call it destiny fate kismet

whatever it is we must try to accept that its part of a greater plan

and someday when we least expect it

god will send us the answers

the battle is never fought alone even though we might feel alone in the fight for with god the feeling of being alone never supersedes the fact of his presence

any refuge other than god is probably something that i should seek refuge from rather than seek refuge in

faith is life knowledge is death and choosing the correct one is wisdom

sure way to pull down any faith or religion is to overpopulate to the extent that humanity goes for a toss but humanity will win eventually as faith is the byproduct of humanity

friend you need to believe in something much bigger than yourself you have to let go

faith gives me the heart to believe in myself when no one else does

without the mercy of the maker every man should have perish in his sins

the maker is a miracle worker

they say that believing in god can be hard but from where i’m standing that’s nothing compared to having to believe in myself yet the oddest thing of all is that god believes in me even if i don’t believe in either of us

to repent is to be reformed

godliness is a great gain

to desire heaven is to delight in holiness

faith isnt about logicyou cannot disprove the things you study any more than we can prove to you that the hero will save us we simply must believe it and accept the things preservation has taught us

faith is why im here

we must not only survive but strive

i am impressed i have faith really in what particular deity oh none of them

and i say a final last prayer this one in gratitude that there are people in the world who will protect kids with a fire that makes them sprint after cars fight systems curse with rage

its enough to make you believe

maybe not in symbols maybe not in gods but certainly in people

to convert is to convinced

i am like a little pencil in gods hand he does the writing the pencil has little to do with it  mother teresa

sufferings purifiers the soul

look to the religion and not to the people

why should i believe you a commonborn woman over the son of a margrave

hathui smiled wryly god makes the sun to rise on noblewoman and commoner alike the lord and lady love us all equally in their hearts my lady

trusting yourself is the opposite of trusting god if you trust god totally as you must you must mistrust yourself if you trust yourself you are automatically mistrusting god

faith is not enough you also need an act of will the act of will you need is precisely deciding to trust god fully and mistrust yourself

modern psychology has lost its bearings when they insist that one must trust oneself that position is unchristian

be spiritually independent enough that your relationship with the savior doesnt depend on your circumstances or on what other people say and do

nothing beats a genuine faith that completely trust gods power and provision

faith is a sure foundation

let faith be the fire that warms your heart

pray for the prosperity of thy soul

the glory of god is reveal through his righteous redemptive power

praying is a pleasurable paradise

be firm in your faith

i asked for strength that i might achieve

i was made weak that i might learn humbly to obey

i asked for health that i might do greater things

i was given infirmity that i might do better things

i asked for riches that i might be happy

i was given poverty that i might be wise

i asked for power that i might have the praise of men

i was given weakness that i might feel the need of god

i asked for all things that i might enjoy life

i was given life that i might enjoy all things

i got nothing that i asked for

but everything that i had hoped for

almost despite myself my unspoken prayers were answered

i am among all men most richly blessed

faith is to believe and knowledge is accomplished through death

i’m not interested in some theoretic sermon that ends with a hope and prayer dad i need to hear something real something that literally broke the fabric of your life a story that ends with proof of life instead of some wishywashy platitude

how do you last a torrid time in life

accept the reality that you are in the throes of a crisis stop wishing that it didn’t exist acceptance always delivers inner peace

know that the storm will always be strong by even thinking of its ferocity you are only going to feel debilitated at the epicenter of a storm it is always calm find that center your center that’s where you will find strength

your center is where you lose sense of time place and thought art – anything inherent that makes you come alive – often leads you there

trust the process of life do what you can do without losing your inner peace – daily diligently

no matter how intense it is no storm lasts forever all storms pass so be patient surrender completely let go…and offer yourself to be led by life…

redemption leads to refreshing time

heavenly father be our helper

run the race of life with righteousness of faith

without god there is no grace

i don’t know what is more frightening a creature on a small planet worshipping itself and its world as if infinity did not exist or a creature who burns its fellow beings because the infinite does exist

its okay to lose faith when things dont go right

just ensure your pathway and remember to shine bright

he tried to hide how nervous he felt if this experimental serum worked it would change his whole life that meant everything to him he closed his eyes and prayed to himself

he always hoped god would provide him with salvation someday he believed that everything he went through was a test of his faith

to be human is to be vulnerable sometimes rituals and faith help us feel a little less so

persistent endeavour is the grace to keep you going towards the pursuit of your goals against the great odds

regarding spirituality some have knowledge some have faith but many have neither

worrying about your future will rob you of your present you deserve a good present

the shield of faith is spiritual food

the knowledge of the scripture is a shield of faith

i have followed my instincts many times when i have been looking for things that i could not see and faith that they would be revealed with time has always been rewarded

faith is life and knowledge is death

without grace there is no spiritual growth

faith is to suspect something is there and knowledge is to encounter it

may we find strength to endure life changing scenes

at all times trust in god

right now is the time to repent

the holy hour is now seek the highway of holiness

there is salvation for sinners through the grace of god

he gifted the people he made with an echo of his creative power

faith allows us to be directed by christ with the action of obedience

i trust contrariness  i simply rebelled at being commanded

faith is not a feeling faith is willed obedience in action

satan plants questions in your mind and says ‘answer this with logic’ but god says ‘no answer with faith

we want the schedule for the next five years but god says take my hand lets just focus on doing the next right thing

a flicker that lies inside of you

it surely will help if children understand life’s simple unalterable truths early on

what goes up comes down and will go back up again also what goes around comes around

until we get what we want we must be patient

life happens through us and not because of us

this human form this lifetime is a gift that we must be eternally grateful for

we know not what we shall be we just follow the path with diligence pursuit

the greatest treasure is awe reverence for god

having the eyes of a child does not mean that we are naïve rather it means that we’ve become brave enough to believe in a great good while simultaneously embracing the reality of a great evil

save by grace

directed by grace

by grace i will be obedient

if god believes in you then it doesn’t matter if anyone else does and god has never not believed in you

faithfulness comes from a place of trust and loyalty

to believe is to obey

hope is a healer

repent to be restored

faith in god is like a well watered garden

i believe therefore i am blessed

stand firm in your faith

without sin there is no saviour

the utterly frightening thing about great things is that we don’t know where they’re taking us we can’t control them and we’ll never be able to return to what we left and are those things not the things that make great things great

praying brings us to god s presence

faith is the fear of god

as for me i will believe in no belief that does not make itself manifest by outward signs i will think no preaching sincere that is not recommended by the practice of the preacher

when there is nothing left to believe in

i still have faith in me

in the way i could survive it all

the way i could get out of bed each morning no matter how terrible my nights have been

and in the way my dear i could always stand so tall and so strong no matter how many hands have left me even when i needed them the most

i will always have faith in the woman i am becoming because she is the bravest of all whom i’ve know …

but failure to disprove something is not a good reason to believe it

broken expectations arent meant to crush our hopes but to free us to put our confidence in god alone they arent meant to make us give up but look up

he envied this in them this ability they had to still be awestruck the faith they maintained that life adulthood would keep presenting them with astonishing experiences that their marvellous years were not behind them

we cheated fate like destiny had no say

but here we are again meeting in the same way

emotional hurts are like cancers of the soul if we don’t get them out they can poison the whole soul and body

fear is the absence of faith while the presence of faith leaves us with the absence of nothing

faith and fear are found on the same streets

do you remember these words

‘what lamp has destiny to guide her little children stumbling in the dark

no matter how much youre failing if you dont see yourself falling youre on your road to greatness

singing strengthens the spirit

that which is possible is only the seedbed for that which is impossible and therefore if we neglect to plant liberally we might live lives full of the possible but we will never hold the harvest of the impossible

without faith it’s impossible for you to be a complete sensual woman

having a different belief system is not a crime but having a belief system that belittles other belief systems is not just a crime but downright dangerous to peace and progress

she was listening differently now that shed realized how important it was to seek god in the quiet times in order to know what to cling to in the chaos

it’s called walking by faith not sitting by faith

if i’d been born in ancient greece i’d worship zeus and aphrodite

these beliefs contradict each other so they can’t be all right

what is preaching it is proclamation not just moralizing it is good news not just good advice it is gospel not just law supremely it is about god and what he has done not just about us and about what we ought to do

there are so many different faiths how do you know the holy book you have been brought up with is the true one and if all the others are wrong what makes you think your holy book isnt wrong too

what if rich did not have to mean wealthy and whole did not have to mean healed what if being people of the gospel meant that we are simply people with good news god is here we are loved it is enough

life is precious regardless of how you choose to think about it

the weird thing about the bible is that almost everything in it is a metaphor

so that’s also church right

i know this might seem blasphemous but my priest tells me its okay to ask questions even if they seem bizarre

become a faithful servant cultivate wisdom courage faith and resilience

having faith is great but beliefs are so dangerous some people end up selling their souls to the religions

if something didn’t happen it’s probably not that it couldn’t rather it’s more that we chose not to believe that it could

god is second to none so when i walk with him my fear should be second to everything to the point that it is present in nothing

god is second to none so when i walk with him my fear should be second to everything to the point that it is present in nothing

we squander our souls by giving them over to what makes them feel good rather than surrendering them to what makes them grow strong

god is moving you from a life of needing the get out of jail free card to a lifestyle of living free

how long are we going to let the devil lick us raw when we have the shout of the king living inside of us

people may betray you but you don’t need to take it personally

we must be compassionate but not enable people to blame or shame us out of god’s blessings

you can never do for someone what they are not willing to do for themselves

i hadn’t thought of—let alone said—soul leading in many years and stumbled awkwardly through the words ian spoke it without hesitation though and i wondered how often he had used it through those years

a man can be converted when convinced

you are not someone’s answer you are an example of what the answer can do in someone’s life and you are compelled to share how you did it by god’s word and his grace but only their yielding in obedience to god is their answer

we may not be able to make people’s decisions but we can choose to forgive and be made whole in him

that ‘god will provide’ is a sanguine statement laced with faith he does not bring one out in the dark and switch off the light

you were never created to please people you were created to please god

you have such a big heart you care so deeply for your angels and you love every single thing you create you want to share your love you

one day todays trials will be tomorrows testimony make that story of triumph a remarkable lesson in perseverance and faith

if you let sharks call the shots control and manipulate you it will lead you down a road of burnout hopelessness and even depression

it is our duty to pray for such an act brings us to the presence of the mighty god who desires to show mercy to all who call upon his holy name

our comfort zone has been the suffocation of our dreams

as breathing is to life prayer is to the church the breath of life comes into us prayer rises within us and communion with god becomes the most normal thing that there is

we are prayers

our life is a prayer

our stance in god is a prayer

our place in him is a place of prayer

prayer is what we build into our lives

prayer is what we become

we are an outworking of how we work with him

we are prayers

our life is a prayer

our stance in god is a prayer

our place in him is a place of prayer

prayer is a lifestyle

despair is not your portion

we work with the spirit of god in prayer

prayer is not just for an individual — prayer is for everyone

it is impossible to pray accurately for someone and still have something against him even if you have something against him if you pray for him you will end up loving him

never allow whats in your head to become a blockage to who is in your spirit

if you walk with god he leads you into your future he doesnt hold you in your past

is mans voice in your life stronger than gods voice

patience is not the toleration of what is wrong

yes you are a son of god but a son must have a heart to serve

to be faithless is to be powerless

to be powerful exercise your faith

god says i know the plans i have for you plans for good and not for evil plans for a future and a hope

love will always be at the center of a work that prays

even in matters of faith you can always depend on the constants of supply and demand

we must have heart and overcome if we are to thrive in life and not merely survive

if we are living for the approval of others we aren’t living for the approval of god

you only need one approval and that’s god’s

if you have to perform for people’s approval trust me it’s not worth having

trust god and follow his will for your life his love is unconditional

fear and intimidation is the most common and easy shark attack to fall prey to

be bold be courageous god’s grace is backing you

why do we try to look for sharks why do we try to please the sharks that hurt us hold us back and keep us from our destinies

if you allow sharks to dictate your decisions they will try to exert their will on you more and more

god has called us to love people to be an example and to be kind but we have to take courage and be wise because there are sharks out there

we don’t need to be fearful of sharks but we do need to have an awareness of them

satan wants to use sharks to move you from your purpose don’t let him

i have faith she had said but only for every minute out of a hundred so i act on that one moment even when im not in it

there was no region changed by good preaching — regions were changed by praying into the realm of glory

that sense of inferiority is just another word for fear and fear is simply the selfdeception that you are about to be separated from the thing you most value

you want to walk with god and do only what he wants you to do

if you are so busy in this life that you dont have time to tap into spiritual laws to learn them then youre just working this planet by yourself

the greatest loss is the loss of one’s calling because we were listening to the wrong voices

if you spend your time filling yourself with the word the word will spend its time filling your life with what is rightfully yours in christ

god can show you where to capture the fish but you have to cast the net

i am not ashamed of my god but i am deeply ashamed of the fact that we have created a gospel that is far more of ‘us’ and far less of god and more of ‘us’ is not anything that any of us need but more of god is everything that we all need

praying is the purest of all pleasures

lord i don’t want to be relevant in the industry by shading hurting and ruining other people’s lives career and reputation for the sake of likes retweets and comments

help me to make it because of my hard work education talent skills and support from people not because i have dragged others down

fear will keep you grounded in the wrong way take the leap and soar

if the thoughts are not here today just walk away and wait to write another day

the element of faith is what writing speculative fiction is all about we introduce readers to the supernatural and the miraculous which cannot be explained through reason

the compromise of one generation brings the complacency of the next generation

while the church is on the earth we have an opportunity to do it gods way

do not settle for what is not the mind of christ

attending church grows old quick its already on the inside of you you bring the supply

im for christ his glory his kingdom his way

conquering can give you courage

when a shark has influence in your life it makes you want to stay in the boat

intimidation keeps your eye on you and conveys that image to others

intimidation isn’t pretty it compels you to compare yourself to everything and everyone else

show me your prayer life and i will show you your destiny

giving up on god’s assignment on your life because of naysayers manipulators fear or setbacks is the biggest mistake we can make

you have to learn how to deal with difficult situations and difficult people they are never going away

you live in sharkinfested waters you can either be afraid and intimidated or you can learn to deal with them

if you get out of the boat you’re going to have to learn how to swim you’re going to have to learn to adapt think new thoughts and learn new skill sets you’re going to have to change and that’s what god wants

god wants us to get out of the boat get into the water and learn as we go

i want to encourage you don’t settle build the dream god has given you

you risk failure no matter what you do so why not do what you love

you can always find a reason to hesitate to quit or to delay jumping headfirst into your dreams but you’ll never step into the call on your life until you do

it has always been the regular state of things there is no clarity no relief at he end of all rationality there is simply the need to decide and the faith to live through to endure

if we live in a place of hurt how can we be effective in our own lives or in impacting others

hurt feelings destroy so many relationships not only that but they can take us off course from our destinies if we let them

we’re all looking for others to make us feel special valued and even exceptional and when others fail to do what we need we get our feelings hurt

the culture is out of control and we can’t afford to fail into their divisive worldly attitudes which lead to rebellious ways

jesus is not a way to truth he is the way

you and i are called to speak truth even when the culture tries to pressure us into silence

we must be careful to say the truth with the least offense but it has to be the truth nonetheless

we must make sure our ways mirror the word of god if we are going to live free and inherit the blessings of god for our lives this is not the hour to compromise to keep from getting our feelings hurt

our goal should be to represent jesus in every situation when i was dealing with sharks i didn’t have the answers but god did

if you keep your eyes on jesus and prioritize your walk with him you’ll build your life on the right foundation

the decisions you make every day are either building up or tearing down your life what you meditate on what you think about and how you use your time set the course for your future

the feeling of obligation can cause you to make bad decisions for your time family and destiny

it’s not always destruction that keeps us from our destiny it’s distraction

sharks will try to steal your time and intention but you have to protect your focus keep your eyes on jesus he will carry you through persecution to victory

we have to fight the battle for our destinies not the battle for approval

we can’t sacrifice the will of god for the approval of people

people will criticize the very thing god has called you to do saying it seems impossible to them or too hard for them but that’s why god called you to do it not them

the difference between world changers and stagnant drifters comes down to the ability to focus on opportunities and then seize them

a belief in nothing is just as much a belief as a belief in something

sharks don’t eat fish because of anything the fish do they don’t eat fish because those fish aren’t good enough fish or because those fish aren’t nice enough to the sharks sharks eat fish because they are sharks

if you are looking for a pathway to your dreams that won’t require you to have courage you’ll be looking for the rest of your life

it is not the eyes that are blinded but blinded are the hearts which are within the breasts

my faith is not some pathetic emotional escape from a reality that i am unable to cope with rather my faith is the power to change that reality by changing me so that i can change it and from that i don’t need any escape nor do i want one

in all seasons of the unknown we have a choice to either be a victim in the tension or enter into a deeper dependency upon god

jesus didn’t come to save us for sunday services he came to redeem our everyday

desire is much like fire it is beautiful and mesmerising but if unguarded can cause great destruction and loss

god doesnt promise an easy journey just a safe place to land

it is not eyes that are blinded but blinded are the hearts which are within the breasts

the difficult we do now

the impossible takes a little longer

though i dont believe i come to you now and i lift my doubt to your mercy

if there’s one thing i’ve learned after a lifetime of facing fears it’s that there’s no reward without some risk

i expend my days relentlessly attempting to design my life in a manner that is designed to meet the needs in my life yet god did not design life to do that rather he designed life to direct us to him so that he could do that

your dreams are on the other side of your fears

there are no shortcuts to your destiny just one single choice am i going to jump in the water

it’s time to let go of everything that’s held you back intimidated or discouraged you in the past it’s time to be fearless

if you’re waiting for the perfect opportunity the perfect training or the perfect tools before you step out in obedience to god you’ll be waiting forever

the one thing every successful person has in common is that they started where they were with what they had that’s all they could do and that’s all you can do too

nothing equips you for success like noble failure

we wanted to help people but because we gave so much of an allowance to negative people in our lives we lost sight of the big picture we wasted our time on people who couldn’t be pleased and we felt like we had failed

with life comes handy

so does hope faith  smile

if you always take responsibility for the people who wrong you or don’t like you you will be bound by a spirit of people pleasing and ultimately miss your destiny

great leaders don’t allow failure to redefine their purpose they use failure to refine their purpose

whether you fail or succeed doesn’t alter the identify or purpose god has placed in you

the universe has faith in you even if you dont the gypsy queen said that why i am here to be a thread of your tapestry even you couldnt see the whole picture quite just yet

sparks are what give us ideas

they keep us going when darkness is all around us

they can fill us with hope

they can make the world seem sane again

just because it is dark and gloomy doesnt mean that there is no light

justice should be blind but not blind with greed the people must have faith in the fundamental fairness and impartiality of our system of justice if we are to have order in our society those who make a mockery of it must not go unpunished

as mortals called on god on angels and saints as they chanted while telling their rosary raphael was pronouncing the only names that were sacred to him and would not burn his tongue to utter raphael was calling on his family

we model how much we love our kids by the boundaries we set for them

you can love someone deeply but somehow not always do the right thing by them people have flaws we get so much wrong maybe if you try to understand him as a human being with faults then you can move forward

failing to understand the dogma of our faith had always been my goto excuse for never trying to maybe i wanted too much to reign in the center of my own world leaving no room at the inn for divine suppositions

this is a sad story of three brethren kings hijackers of the mind who obviously need no wings three snatchers of religion three monarchs with ambition

we all have the ability to see our life as it is but also imagine a different one

we love god best by loving each other

the conservative puts his faith in yesterday but yesterday never comes

sometimes there are things we never understand that are best left alone  wise archbishop of canterbury

the person of faith cannot accept reason as the arbiter of truth without giving up on faith

his life he said was much less important than his soul  wolf

the gospel does not imply that jesus has risen and nothing else matters but rather jesus has risen and now everything matters we can now live above the line of despair because the gospel is true

one’s truth integrity honor and faith can never be conquered without permission what you allow can be good or evil determines your nature

god had his plans and any journey he invited her to go on would always be an adventure perhaps not the one she expected but always the one that would be the best for her

he has no faith in principles only in frogs

i dont know how but it is happening today

once i stare into the face of god i can stare into the face of anything

if you and your family are not where you think you should be you need to be open for god’s spirit to point out the things that may be hindering your ability to advance

i dont write people off they write me off i want us to be friends and i want you to trust me i love you i always have i always will i am by your side and im going to be with you no matter what  god

you may be outnumbered by your problems and facing hopeless circumstances but god has a divine plan to bring you into restoration  and you don’t have to suffer any casualties

the source of your light will determine your level of bright radiating to others brandy l verdin

faith is vital for surviving life

we must endure the ills of life without weak in faith

enjoy all things

endure as you enjoy

truth leads to believe which produces faith

and as he aged and the world became less real he began to doubt his own beliefs so that by the time he saw the god in whom he had never been able to believe or disbelieve he was probably expecting to do so

god is there looking out listening give him time he will answer all your prayers

my face does not match my story  brandy l verdin

faith is tested through fire

we think god when you part the river ill go god says go and ill part the river

every storm you went through every bad break and every dark lonely season deposited something on the inside it pushed you to mature pushed you to trust god in a greater way pushed you to be more resilient and determined

quran bible and bhagavad gita were told by god and written by you may be you had misinterpreted according to your language faith and culture

why should we reduce faith to an act of rejection and blind obedience is it not possible to believe in values of acceptance of harmony

as long as we blame others for our issues and don’t take personal responsibility we remove ourselves from god’s provision and his correction forgiveness and restoration

you have to keep your eyes on the word of god and keep a guard against strife otherwise when the storms come you’re going to turn your eyes to the wrong thing

the law of releasing life or death in your life is the power of your tongue and it is operating all the time

this is how the enemy divides us as husband and wife he gets you looking at your needs your issues and your problems

unless you have a plan a list of your priorities to do you’re planning to fail

im saying if you do what you were made to do then youll find the peace youve been looking for you cant work for it you know you just have to rest in it  birdie

when it comes to the big questions in life the preponderance of credible evidence is the best advisor to inform our beliefs

the companion enterprise are the methods by which one interprets the evidence which demand unwavering intellectual honesty

wisdom from within

the universe is here for a reason and you have to find out what that reason is

the soul that seekers shall find what the spirit long for

knowing was not necessarily accepting

stand fast in the faith and love one another all of you and be not offended at my sufferings

last words of saint perpetua as testified to by the eyewitness to her martyrdom as preserved by tertullian in the passion of saints perpetua and felicity

neither can i call myself anything else than what i am a christian

saint perpetua as preserved by tertullian in the passion of saints perpetua and felicity

i can wish no better thing for you sirs than this that recognizing in this way that intelligence is given to every man you may be of the same opinion as ourselves and believe that jesus is the christ of god

for it is the property of those who expect to obtain mercy by prayer and sacrifices to cease from and repent of their sins

the highway lies in holiness

love finds its way back home

the information its out there rebbe this part is not a sin

the more we fill up ourselves with the word of god the less room there will be for lies

god has humorous moments with you yet they are never at your displeasure

but from their first word of him from the message that he was found and was alive none of the people of carlow had really doubted it they are simple country people and they know that god is good

to be bold to believe that is all there is

a grateful heart is a beginning of greatness it is an expression of humility it is a foundation for the development of such virtues as prayer faith courage contentment happiness love and wellbeing

some days the bravest thing we can do

is to hold on have hope to keep walking

even just for another day

as long as you do not lose faith in spite of situation you ask for divine help from god with hope in your heart you shall surely see a change of circumstances

the universe speaks in clues and signs gentle nudges and hints rather than pontifications and proverbs commandments and condemnations i have trusted its signs all my life which is why i listened when it seemed like it wanted me back here

faith in god is the finest of all things

it’s when you humble yourself as a servant that people want to follow you as a leader

restoration leads to refreshing time

there is no force like faith

whatever you believe in that is strength to make you bounce back whenever you get knock down

the righteousness of gods grace leads to repentance

to break through any barrier you must maintain a steadfast believe in god

you can’t live right if you won’t think

every moment of our existence is a miracle

repentance leads to restoration

a firm believe in god is the only force capable of breaking through any barrier towards the realization of dream

prayer paves the path

praying leads us to gods presence

praying leads us to the god of all possibilities

exit the land of delusion

where falsehood lives like a king

let the bridge of faith take you places

where your caged soul can take wing

the only freedom is faith that fuels enthusiasm for a higher self realization

and even though it was just one hug it was enough to lift more dark

a dream within a dream is the dream of a dreamer

sometimes when we think it’s the end of the road is when we learn to fly

nothing and no one is a waste of time

if it doesn’t give us what we are looking for

it teaches us what we need to learn

happiness is harmony of spirit with the soul

the finest of all things is faith in god

righteousness of faith is the right course to holiness

hope and faith flower from the cheerful seeds of the old year to the sprouting garden of the new years dawn

the church is not a place for perfection it is and should be a haven of protection

may i be a pillar

on which upon you stand

a leaning post for young ones

my lover and my friend

may i be a beam of light that you bestow upon

your hopes your dreams your wisdom

so we may carry on

may i be a beacon

a tree with roots so strong

treetop spreading high and wide

a trunk so wide and long

may i be your music

a flute for you to play

whatever you desire

with each forthcoming day

may i lose myself to find you

support all those who need

my love my core my laughter

permeate my every deed

you tried and failed so what i failed today too but hey lets try again

every time someone speaks a faith statement it gives heaven

more energy one ingredient to answered prayers is faith heaven runs on that power

i wonder sometimes if the continentals were like shoals of fish  the slightest flick of one fish caused dozens of others to follow suit until the entire shimmering cloud had changed course

dont be afraid to speak up what is the point of free speech if you have nothing to say

it is better to ultimately succeed with the truth than to temporarily succeed with a lie

you have one life take a leap of faith

quit your job to saved your life and your health no job is worth risking physical or mental health over get out

when we lose the belief in ‘something better’ we’ve embraced the belief in ‘all things worse’ and such a perspective is based less on things being worse and more on our inability to believe that we can make it better

being denied disability payments shatters your faith in corporate government

we were only children steffan god forgives us for being careless and not knowing what to do well never be able to be good enough to make up for what happened i guess we have to accept that gods grace is sufficient

sensuality is knowing deep down within yourself that you’re going to be okay no matter what happens it’s having faith that you’re fundamentally worthy whether you get what you want or don’t

god takes the impossible and makes it the inevitable

love is directly proportional to faith the higher the faith the higher the love

we believe that the sun is in the sky at midday in summer not because we can clearly see the sun in fact we cannot but because we can see everything else

granted that good works are to be done are they a cause or input which helps bring about justification or are they a symptom result  or output from a justification already received and possessed through faith

the church is not a place for perfection it is and should be a haven of protection

despite the bad luck life had dealt him he still had faith that tomorrow could indeed bring into being a new world

yet do i believe that all this is true which indeed my reason would persuade me to be false and this i think is no vulgar part of faith to believe a thing not only above but contrary to reason and against the argument of our proper senses

without prayer how can there be progress

praying is the purest pleasure

one of the best things you can do for yourself is to believe in yourself

sometimes we think that the most important thing in our life is body health and it is not the most important thing is our existential dialogue with god our constant response to god with prayer and works

youre brave and smart and kind and id be a fool not to trust you

never wish to be a want

only the blood of the blameless lamb the lord jesus christ can wash the stain of sin to be made as clean as cotton

love is like a beautiful glass transparent precious and clear

once broken you can imagine how it looks

can be fixed but its never same again

faith is accepting god’s offer of love—even if it means holding his hand in the dark

in a jaded world it takes a certain type of person to remain a romantic  someone with resolute faith in goodness

i think that the stories that god has told and the things that he has done seem utterly implausible to us only because we lock him into the tiny rubrics that the stories he has told and the things that he has done invite us outside of

with faith you can overcome your fears

faith can cure fear

face your fears with faith

only christ jesus can clean your heart

without faith where is the force of being

sorrow sanctifies the soul

revolution is to seek the righteousness of faith

life is never fair so keep your faith firm

the light of faith makes us see what we believe

it is not true that fate slips silently into our lives it steps in through the door that we have opened and we invite it to enter

a faith based on miracles will quickly fade dependent on the next miracle such an attitude cannot even be called faith

i think that the stories that god has told and the things that he has done seem utter implausible to us only because we lock him into the tiny rubrics that the stories he has told and the things that he has done invite us outside of

humility cannot exist without love and love cannot exist without humility it is impossible for these virtues to exist except where there is great detachment from all created things

life is a helluva journey you face situations you meet people you try to understand situations you try to understand people

but you will never ever be able to understand people you will never ever be able to understand why some things happen

you thus give up on people you lose faith in people you lose faith on life

you just go on living life without feeling anything you live life in a state of numbness and indifference

and then one day you look at yourself in the mirror and you have become a stranger to yourself

in whatever battle were facing we too often lose hope and once weve lost hope weve not only lost the battle weve lost everything else as well

history is a test of faith and the correct response to that test is persistent prayer

now if that could happen in one minute think of the long history of most faiths

christmas is not a story of hope it is hope

it isn’t faith that dies out but the way it is transmitted faith is like a fire that dies out if you don’t feed it

remember that true humility consists in being ready for what the lord wants to do with you and happy that he should do it and in considering yourselves unworthy to be called his servants

i and  poem by tridib mitra

autumns phantasmagoric tempest

i am at the door of

wooden knocks who are you

whats this

reality has become very dense

we see the world as fragmented because we blink but god who never blinks sees the entire universe as we cannot see it whole

life is a helluva journey you face situations you meet people you try to understand situations you try to understand people

but you will never ever be able to understand people you will never ever be able to understand why some things happen

you thus give up on people you lose faith in people you lose faith on life

you just go on living life without feeling anything you live life in a state of numbness and indifference

and then one day you look at yourself in the mirror and you have become a stranger to yourself

we wonder why god waits to step in after it’s too late that’s because with god there is no such thing as too late

i don’ know if we believe that things can’t be done rather i think that we’re too fearful to believe that maybe they can

prayer without work leads to the poor house

to her steady lover  poem by jibanananda das

there is no meaning in living—i dont say this

there is meaning for some may be for all—may be a perfect meaning

yet i hear the white sound of winddriven birds

in the water of the distant seas

beneath the burning summer sun

the candle burns slowly very slowly on my table

the books of intellect are more still—unwavering— lost in meditation

yet when you go out on to the streets

or even while sitting by the window side

will you sense the frenzied dance of violent waters

right beside that a book of your cheeks no more like a lantern

perhaps like a conchshell lying on the beach as if oceans father

it is also a music by his own merit—like nature

caustic—lovable—finally like the most favourite entity

so i get the taste of expansive wind in the airing

otherwise in the minds forest the python coils up around the doe

i feel the pitiable hint of a life like that in the sceptre of protest

some glaciercold still flock of cormorants will realize my words

when the electriccompass of life will cease

they will eat up snowgrey sleep like polar seas in endless grasp

most of us are too afraid to believe in a god who can part the red sea

if you dispute something written in the bible you can’t plausibly claim to have ‘faith’ in that same god

as a diminutive woman i didn’t take any offense at all at sometimes being referred to as ‘the weaker vessel’ but magali was almost comically enraged by it

i had to face a certain disappointment in god this real god i had finally met was actually a man and favoured a mans world discriminated against me

no matter how hard you try to fit the pieces together sometimes its beyond your control so sit back and trust in his plans

i said all

i did what is right

god knows what happened

god knows my intentions

my conscience is clear but

are they as fair as my conscience

i put my trust and faith in god

if you have but the faith of a mustard seed you shall move mountains

truth forever on the scaffold wrong forever on the throne yet that scaffold sways the future behind the dim unknown stands god within the shadow keeping watch above his own

god has called us in the power of the holy spirit to live wisely and be women of purpose who live our lives for our jesus and love those he has put in our lives well

i must be reminded that god often seems distant because i’ve made him smaller than what he is and my struggles bigger than what they are

having the ability to recognize and appreciate your blessings is a blessing

the essence of universe has three words the patience the faith and the journey for the unknown destiny

with god the impossible is demoted to the rank of the possible

daughter take courage your faith has made you well at once the woman was made well matthew  the woman was healed because jesus himself is healing

she had faith in him

excerpt from danielle freitag the garden keys  keys of restoration volume   the beginning to israel ibooks

we’re either ‘running from’ something or ‘running to’ something and i think that true freedom is ‘resting in’ something

as we grow older it is our responsibility as adults to control our destiny  we are the masters of our faith we are the captains of our souls

at the end of hope

what we need is not truths which will serve us but a truth which we may serve

ive chosen fear over faith more times than i can count she admitted and every time i did i ended up with regrets

change is a product of learning and doing too many of us just learn and judge ⁣

creativity lives at the crossroads of breadth and depth⁣

it’s not all about right or wrong it’s all about how you perceive

i choose not be what the world is rather i choose to be what the world says i cannot be

take flight my little angel for your wings are stronger than your faith

god is more interested in making us what he wants us to be than giving us what we ought to have

because i have always wanted to believe in god in ghosts in karma in ufos

if you’re not changing forwards you’re changing backwards because we are always changing

nowhere among the early christians do we find the cold

light of intellectual understanding that constantly analyzes and

differentiates instead there was the spirit that burned within

their hearts and made their souls alive col –

hope which is not anchored in the truth is an illusion

the more you prepare yourself the more the opportunities god will give you

well if there’s a hell like this place then there has to be a heaven somewhere

idolatry is the thing that will always get in the way of and ultimately destroy your relationship with god your heavenly father

those whom the lord uses will have to be willing to be misunderstood and persecuted by people who have historically meant a great deal to them

studies have consistently revealed that a lot of people who attend church do not really have a personal relationship with god my friend that is a staggering revelation and the implications for the church are farreaching

in life we have two choices after being heartbroken we can become bitter or better always choose the latterbetter

i envied the mullah now envied his faith and certainty

do not try to pull people to your path all you have to do is to travel on your own path with great enthusiasm and faith

being able to recognize and appreciate your blessings in life is a blessing

when you pray you are sending a message forward to a time you will not see

we all have to rely on god’s infinite grace and keep trying keep loving keep believing and do the best we can

god always threw the life preserver that messedup selfish humans desperately needed right when they needed itright at the point of breaking when they’d actually grab on

the mountains will fall to dust before i will ever give up on my daughter

will we abandon the dream to the brutality of the road that we must walk in order to bring the dream to reality or will we lay ourselves before god as the author of dreams and leveler of roads

everyone on earth is on death row until they find a way out it’s not so hard to find the way out the problem is wanting to

or dark

or fly

where your feet

has yet to spark

well trust god for our eternal salvation but not trust him in the small details of our daytoday life

you cant say you have faith in god if you cant trust him with everything neither can you say you trust god if you lack faith in him without faith you cannot please god and without trust you cannot have faith in god heb

what have you got to lose what are you hanging onto trust you have not come this far to turn back now you are almost there have faith

don’t have a goal in mind when it comes to people your value is the love you share with the world that love will always draw to you what you need remain faithful to the spirit you see in others and you will save them a thousand years of tears

love brought you this far so why not believe in love

from the ashes greater consciousness shall rise

god is in control  god is good  god loves you  your peace

so the first things we must do is decide which it is a

and how can you soar

when you are so rooted to your pain

the lessons of letting go my love are never made in vain

take what you need so you can navigate your way

and let the rest go with love and with faith

we are therefore i believe

truly sacred rest is soul care we honor quiet time alone with god we intentionally step away from the chaos of life we unplug from noise and distractions we relish moments of tranquility

active faith is having the wisdom to know that you can develop future knowledge to alleviate your currently incurable sickness

discovery comes from a lot of failures knowledge wisdom faith and a dose of craziness

the worst can happen but the best remains

traditions and dogmas rub one another down to a minimum in such centers of varied intercourse where there are a thousand faiths we are apt to become sceptical of them all

faith is the language which makes us understand the true meaning of words when faith is lacking two people can’t live together harmoniously while millions can unite as one if people have faith in each other

maybe one of the greatest accomplishments that we can achieve is coming to understand what we can achieve on second thought maybe it’s not understanding as much as it is believing

this morning the birds were singing before the sun came up and in thinking about that it amazed me that they would readily sing into the darkness without demanding that the light show itself first

there are those who say that it can’t be done and then there are those who say that it will be done if i listen to the former it will never be done but if i listen to the latter i’ll find that it’s already done before it’s done

it’s not that i don’t believe in god rather it’s that i don’t believe in not believing in god

god pursues us he pursues us in our brokenness he pursues us in our mishaps despite our rebellion or resistance he pursues us to the very end

your heavenly father creates a place of refuge for you a safe place to offer you relief he can comfort you in times of trouble god prepares a table for you not just any meal but a beautiful banquet

silence can be the birthing in which gods doing a new thing we may not visually see it but that doesnt mean its not happening

the spiritual awakening process is like rebirth gradually the false pretenses that had once blinded us is replaced with a great awakening to our savior to his true nature to his wonderful character to his faithfulness

when the sun begins rubbing the eastern horizon warm with the first pastelthin light of a new day i am reminded that the sun had to let the world go dark before it was sufficiently positioned to make the world become light

when we see the reality which can’t be explained by our existing faith and beliefs we drop or modify our beliefs and try to understand the world by using our renewed beliefs our faith is not hardcoded but changes with time like a living entity

at her lowest point she found her greatest strength not because she alone was strong but because she held onto faith with all her might

vision is the ability to see through the dense mass of meaningless stuff that a visionless life has caused us to construct

it is the one terrible heresy of the church that it has always been presenting something else than obedience as faith in christ

dont deceive yourself the church does not heal anyone your faith is the one that cures you

grave is precious as pearls

prayer is as precious as pearls

grace is as precious as pearls

swandiving through warm drops of rain

soaking up champagneshaded rays of bliss

problack posers get paid to expose us  try to ripout our roots and pollute our culture

we do not know why things happen as they do but can trust he who knows all things thy divine beinggod

the grace of righteousness of faith leads to repentance

i believe for we are

the problem with wishing was that it only worked with stars and flowers and neither were at her disposal

everything feverishly works to convince us that they can be everything that we need and when will the level of our impoverishment finally convince us that we should be unconvinced

without a song we will be sad

im hopefully a grain of sugar in gods cup of green tea

never give up on yourself

if only you face your fears with boldness of faith you overcome the negative thoughts

if you read stories you find strength to endure any situation souls have overcome such common circumstances with enduring faith

the heavenly father is faithful father

to pray is to seek heavenly blessings

my faith demands that i do whatever i can wherever i am whenever i can for as long as i can with whatever i have to try to make a difference

brotherly love is the bond of faith

the faith my father has in me it is the greatest gift he has ever given me more than a father he is a friend a true friend

the spirit of purposeful prayer is to seek the heavenly blessings

a mother must pray persistently for her children if she delight in their prosperity

if the alternative to believing in god is believing in men then the answer as to why i should believe in god is not only simple it’s blatantly obvious

the destructive quality of spiritual amnesia is that we forget the promise in light of the problem and we also forget the times when the provision was made for us and we found ourselves standing safe and secure on the other side

whatever faith you have always be relaxed always feel yourself free and never forget this your beliefs are not important than you you are more important than your beliefs

just like a common language is the key to communication of knowledge a common faith is the key to living happily in a group as a family or friends

it is difficult to understand human beings as rational beings because even our rational mind is guided by our emotions emotions are the product of our beliefs which are based on faith without much logic and reason behind them

when you understand the language of the faith of another person you can connect with him not only intellectually but also emotionally a common faith builds relationships and binds people

i give you comfort i give you peace i give you joy i give you hope i give you life

jesus kept talking to her

i give you strength i give you love i give you power i give you me

jennifer started jumping up and down and hugging jesus

sovereign lord your saving help is my shield

let the living live while there is breath

trials teaches a man better than tales

love me while am living

love me while i am living

a loving family is the fruit of life

faith is the seed of faithfulness

misfortune may pave the path to fortune with faith

hope holds the heart of the spirit in a steadfast state

explore eternity of existence with eagerness

life is neither a fun nor a feast but faith

god and the seasons could always be counted on    if only men were so reliable

set me as a seal upon thine heart read harry as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death    the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehement flame

the light from the cabin drew him like the beacon of a lighthouse pulling in a weary sailor it shone for miles over the rolling land

we dont get to pick our background hoke she told him one time but we can sure enough pick our future

children grow wings abigail you got to let em or they wont be strong to face whatever lies before them

james was standing on the ground he and hoke had packed hard with their foot trafficarms crossed admiring the work of their laborwhen the idea seeded and planted in his mind

brotherly love is a blessings of life

no amount of darkness can ever put out the smallest flicker of light

when we count our blessings we find the best comfort

when i count my blessings i find the best comfort in a blessed existence

what a privileged to pray

just because god does not remove the thorn doesnt mean hes not using it for our good and his glory

the kingdom of god lies within thee

peace is a state of being that is not reflective of what is transpiring around me but is reflective of what god is doing within me

faith isnt for the faint of heart

both courage and naivete

are required to grasp its art

you must look the other way

when all the omens seem to say

you will not get what you desire

so though it may be cliche

i put my faith in fire

if we return unto god he will not reject us

rock bottom is lower than i thought

there is nothing to look forward to

so for now i just have faith and

ill let it guide the way until i can

stretch my wings wide and fly again

it’s not about the magnitude of the thing that i fear rather it’s about the magnitude of my attitude about the thing that i fear

you cannot judge a guy by his cover but by the story he is writing for himself

it is the storm that i watch so that it will not catch me unawares when i should be watching god in the storm so that he can catch me in the waves

and perhaps that was the test of faith to know and not to say to live with knowing and let the truth live only in ones head

belief and faith in religion fragrances and breezes the humanity within the human otherwise the gorillas exist on the planet too however religion completes human quality and dignity

why don’t you have a mate benny he mock shuddered can you imagine how mean a woman would have to be in order to put up with me the thought scares me outta my boots

when in pain pray

remember the time of repentance is now do not wait till there is no remedy

when we believe and walk in the light of gods trustworthiness we can hardly miss finding him to be so

faith is the bridge between god and ourselves

now i need the courage to disclose my secrets and believe god will take care of me no matter what the results are of the truth emerging i want to trust he can use it for good in my life    somehow

faith for those few that are chosen even though many are called elohim meant it for everybody to enter but they dare not walk through the narrow difficulty so they give into lifes delicacies that cant fulfill and leads to misery and slavery

the eternity of existence is the sacredness of faith

what is god but a being with more power than those below them can comprehend with understanding more vast than others can imagine if you do not believe such a being exists above you then surely you are a god talkamar

fast is a royal feast

praise my allrighteous god lord you are beyond description of what i can put in words the human language with all its most beautiful intensified descriptive words cant express an inch of your amazingness

im only running forward lighting up the dark within

anxiety is freedom’s possibility this anxiety alone is through faith absolutely formative since it consumes all finite ends discovers all their deceptions

i want you to know that finding gods grace laced through the seasons of your heart

begins with resting in who he is

builds by rehearsing the truth he says about you

blossoms as we respond in faith to those truths and

is sustained by remembering his provision

darkness is the place where god is not therefore if i’m sitting in a bunch of darkness i’m living without much of god

there is more to life than both cold facts and blind faith

religion without sense is like a car with no wheels you can be in it but it won’t take you anywhere we must be logical and goodnatured if we want it to take us places for the greater good

a believer is walking with the lord if he is constantly doing his will

the approval of the holy ghost is what the scriptures call being born of the spirit

the lord has prepared a plan where you have grace if you abide in the lord’s will

if you want to reach god that journey starts on earth after that it is too late

you cannot have the holy ghost without the resurrected jesus

if you know the lord as being on the cross you are dead already it is as though the lord is still in the grave

when a believer receives the holy ghost that person has received the power of god in him

so lets make a deal i will try to do the best i can to do good in the world i will serve others and i will work against suffering but i have to keep asking these questions about your justice and mercy and i cant forget about science

lets just keep talking about this you an i i dont ever want to be away from you again i cant do that anymore

an overcomer is a person that has been through various trials and has subdued the enemy

you cannot tell the lord how to bless you that is a lack of understanding in the things of god

the lord has given to believers in him everything that they need to have a fresh experience with him on a daily basis

if you thought that you have to pray so that the lord can protect you from the enemy you were deceived you receive the lord’s protection as an entitlement as a citizen of the kingdom of god

the holy spirit puts the super into our natural

the holy spirit puts the super into our natural

a harlot is a person who has refused to fully give himself to the lord he is not willing to trust the lord and is seeking to gain from the lord and from the world

if you are a religious person know that you are in a quest that will only lead you to death

the enemy is subtle he does not want the oppressed to know how active he is

the lord is not going to make it difficult for you to do his will he will rather help you do his will

the opposite of faith isn’t doubt the opposite of faith is certaintybeing humble before god means accepting that you may not possess the only path to him

habits form much more than our schedules they form our hearts

there is no greater need than gods grace

love has a healthy disregard for the impossible

it is your faith that will make you stand firm

with inner strength the soul can be still in the storm

in the storm you can only be still

to continue working hard and being patient

soon everything will fall into place

never under estimate a person with a prayer and a plan✍

fight for your own salvation with holy faith

it is your own faith that you will stand firm

the lord will not reward a person for doing the enemy’s will

blessings are gifts that are as a result of loving god

the lord will not bless a person who does not love him

a person who is blessed is the one that has been doing the lord’s will without ceasing

the lord has been seeking for men who are able to do his will

a man who needs god in his life is the one that will seek the lord so that he will live by the lord’s commands

the lord is not going to lead you to hopelessness

the lord will always give you desires that are in his will at the time of his calling upon you

if you are in obedience to the lord you will start experiencing blessings upon your life

if you are a prophet you will need the gift of the word of knowledge even before the gift of prophecy is given to you

the lord is not going to curse anyone without a cause

a humble person is a person who has been gifted by the lord to have favour before both god and man

when you desire anything that is not from the human spirit it is called lust

the lord will use your human spirit to communicate with you through the holy spirit

we prayed until our faith passed into an exhaustion that numbed us to sleep

if you lived my life you wouldn’t believe in coincidence i shouldn’t even be here

the distance of two breaths is the only moment of life we have

this moment is a miracle

love is a sacrificial labour

contemplation is a spiritual practice that has the potential to heal and connect us to the source of our being

protest is not a sign of rebellion or disconnection—at least it shouldn’t be quite to the contrary protest should demonstrate love and investment it should be a sign that we are so invested that we are not willing to settle or surrender

we protest because something or someone we care about is being hurt or diminished protest is not the action of an outsider or someone who is walking away it is the responsibility of relationship—those who refuse to disconnect

the greatest stance that i can take has nothing to do with standing rather it has everything to do with dropping…to my knees

contribute fear to the cause and the effect shall be illness contribute faith to the cause and the effect shall be healing

the future is a blank canvas  rise up and salute the sun

faith is the conqueror of dreams

she took a leap and built wings on the way down

if you wish to venerate gd begin by venerating the earth

so many of us are struggling suffering in the loneliness

we are all fighting something we are all suffering in our own silent way

sometimes when we think its the end of the road

is when we learn to fly

he would be permitted to say to the moment abide you are so fair and to share goethe’s faith  for it was no mere confidence in fame but a cosmic faith the traces of my earthly daysno aeons can impair

remember sister you come from a line of ancient blood your skin is armor your beauty is a blade and your voice rings with steel go to your marriage knowing our ancestors will always guide you

can i go to heaven if you dont and if i do go someplace where my paradise is detached from your eternity where the hell am i

with prayer life is a paradise

there is no paradise like praying

there is no kind teacher like tribulations

treasures are right before our eyes yet many miss gems searching for pearls at the bottom of the sea

i laid down my faith

now life makes more sense to me

religion is more than a source of conflict or a calculated way to stay out of hell religions are treasure chests of stories songs rituals and ways of life that have been handed down for millennia

the spirit is as much a jealous lover as the ego both guard their path with an uncompromising passion but for very different reasons

and though i dont know how todays story will end i remember faith thanks god in the middle of the story

it’s never a fool’s errand to have goals bigger than what we are rather the fool’s errand is believing that there’s no such thing as a god who’s bigger than what our goals are

might we remember what god has saved us from in the past so that we might be saved from our fear of the future

we are the embodiment of the intention that is love which is why love is ultimate reality

the most honorable and biggest reward that you could ever receive in life will be when you meet jesus and his words well done good and faithful servant

if god started it with a vision he will finish it with a harvest

tis better to have an abundance of hope than an absence of faith

if i take into consideration the scope of my sorely limited vision i slowly begin to realize that the less i can see something the greater it actually might be and maybe that’s what vision is all about

for many their dream is simply to survive until tomorrow and in these situations my prayer is not that god would alter their circumstances nor change their heart rather it is that they would invite god into both

impossible is a fact when it comes to people but when it comes to god it’s nothing but bad fiction

learning to have healthy conflict with each other over political challenges is of utmost importance in fact it is a spiritual imperative

if you sing you will not be sorrow

the healing of the heart takes place in the bliss of praise

worship heals all wounds

jesus is my joy

blessed is the nation who fear god

the sovereign lord is my salvation

all you can do in regard to your own life is choose the best path that you believe in

may the blessings of god be upon us from the beginning of the year to its end

it is the person of prayer who shakes the world and it is when our knees hit the ground in prayer that the shaking begins

a mans act according to his belief

fear not

if we know our god we shall do great exploits

full revelation of jesus christ leads to repentance

until you realize you are a sinner can you seek to be saved from the evil of sin

if you wish to be saved from the evil of sin call on the saviour the lord jesus christ

forgiveness belongs to the heavenly father

without hope we are helpless

a mans belief may influence his behaviour

with prayer a man may find the hidden power to progress

selfknowledge is na action for those who are aware of the powers of faith

success leaves clues do not lose your faith on the way you will encounter some obstacles make a commitment and go with it an assumed commitment wins any battle

the name given to all accomplishments is faith in you if you believe you can you can if you put faith in yourself you will attain magic if you feel in your right to go get better things and commit yourself to it nothing can stop you

the pursuit of a holy faith is power of life

the spirit of love is the work of faith

god forgives so we may learn to fear him

righteous faith is to do what is right

god is a faithful god

all things are possible to the one who even wounded was able to find his faith

we stumble in sin because we do not know the scriptures

pray until you can pray

the truth i was beloved of god

finally i could stop trying to force someone or something else to fill that role

mothers hugs and children sun and rising garden of reviving love cross and jesus body meditation and thought prayer and forgiveness

believing is the indomitable consequence of when we acquire true faith

joan of arc was not stuck at the crossroads either by rejecting all the paths like tolstoy or by accepting them all like nietzsche she chose a path and went down it like a thunderbolt

people rivers of belief believe in faith in a living god in changing and in love while there is overcoming there will be evolution especially where there is pain

at what point will i look beyond the rank pessimism of my own attitude and step beyond the jaded opinions of a culture gone sour in order to see that the opportunity for good will always outweigh the schemes of evil

did start to believe in other thing as soon as your faith in other things have weakened when you kept believing your mother welcomed you by the arms just as your luck

there is no such thing as ‘my truth’ or ‘your truth’ he said there is only one truth you’ll live to find that out

the faith i put into something i want is the same faith i think about when wanting it

bear the ills of life without being bitter

all things are possible to the one who even wounded was able to find his faith

without hope there is no faith without faith no hope will hold

a childs faith overthrows dragons their thirst for happiness eliminates all impossibilities

there is no courage without faith there is no love without hope

love is the law of life

suffering is the first step towards sanctification

the greatness of god displays his glory

the blessings of being is the breath of life

repentance leads to times of refreshing

prayer is a plea for mercy

no matter the difficulty do not give up

with prayer your shall preserve thy soul

put your heart and soul into whatever you do – but you won’t be able to do so until you have complete faith in whatever you are doing

are you happy

i think i may be going to be happy

remember things do not force forge or fashion they fall into place

faith operates in the atmosphere of love

what you hear is what determines the level of your faith

the man who has no faith in anything is unreasonable and the man who has no reason is incapable of faith

god take what he would she said and he did and he did and he did

courage is not the absence of fear

its to feel the fear and do it anyway

there is no such thing as false hope there is only hope

can you see god you havent seen him ive never seen the wind i see the effects of the wind but ive never seen the wind theres a mystery to it

the man who has no faith in anything is unreasonable and the man who has no reason is incapable of faith

as soon as fear replaces faith god can no longer answer our prayers or fight on our behalf because his promises will not work apart from faith

the story of america is the story of an adventure that began with deep faith big dreams and humble beginnings

almost everybody needs ideas to live by including hope and faith in order to tolerate the hardships of existence

if it were believable we wouldn’t have to stretch ourselves to believe it therefore because god refuses to leave us trapped in the smallness of ourselves he says things that are unbelievable so that we have no choice but to be stretched

when the storms of life hit you have to anchor down with your feet firmly planted on the ground the winds will blow the trees will shake but you my dear will not break

in many ways the aspect of the story of christ that we both find so compelling and relatable is god’s choice to experience the discomforts of being human as a sign of his love for us …

salvation is to be set free from the evil of sin

lack of prayer is the lost paradise

are you in pain

do not panic pray

what is spiritual can only experience in the spirit of faith

hope sees what we can’t and because we can’t hope asks us to believe that it can

faith is believing in something that i am not and since the vast majority of this existence is made up of what i am not i’m left wondering why is faith so difficult

the only explanation that i can come up with to explain the passion that i have to do what i cannot is the existence of a god who can

god’s faith in me always dwarfs my faith in him

people usually do not trust others because they see others as different from themselves they subconsciously identify themselves with both the positive and negative traits of their character

never give up on yourself even if others start giving up on you

selfconfidence doesn’t require tailored expressions at all times instead it expresses itself in different interesting ways

what we need to do is simply have faith in what we are and find our worth accordingly

have faith in your abilities and in your own uniqueness honor your truth and intuitions it will help you stay firm when others try to bring you down

as individuals we hardly have any control over the world at best what we can do is try controlling ourselves

i can’ certainly sounds better than ‘i can’t’

for only by being truthful about how we got here can we begin to imagine another way

fundamentalism is rooted in arrogance it thrives in fear and control and darkness

without a deep convictionhow can there be a change

god isnt looking for perfection he is seeking men and women with faith greater than fear

as i stand cloaked in some seemingly perpetual darkness desperately hoping for a scant ray of light i ask why has the sun never risen and i realize that it rose a long long time ago i just refused to open my eyes sufficiently to see it

prayer is the power of life

it runs counter to the narratives of greed dehumanization stockpile consumerism and the power that enforces them

our creating is a part of the unfolding generative process of god’s goodness filling the earth our desire to create is an imprint of the divine designed into the fabric of our existence artists and creatives feel this acutely

when we open the book of psalms we are opening the heart of what it means to be human

we must never forget that creatives are possibility makers

the oldest story is one of making god created god made god formed

the oldest story is one of making god created god made god formed

art is powerful it has both the ability to create chaos and to unify we respond to art on an emotional level and it moves us to rethink how we go about our living in the world and living with each other

let adversity reinforce your principles and values not destroy them hold on to them like a strong tree holding on to the ground and his roots against the winds and tempest the storm will pass

on the back of a quarter it says trust in god have you

there is a far greater purpose for us and the world more than we can see or some would like us to see

we must carry on and trust infinitely the power of the soul

when you believe beautiful things will happen if you have the faith of a bird seed or believe in parrots who talk

god justice the rule of law and do you never find those to be in conflict

if i can’t find something worthwhile in my own reflection how am i ever going to see anything worthwhile in the face of another maybe i can solve all of this by seeing the face of jesus in everyone starting with myself

when you stop trying to force the bible to be something its notstatic perspicacious certain absolutethen youre free to revel in what it is living breathing confounding surprising and yes perhaps even magic

to recognise ourselves in each other

is to build the bridge towards compassion and love

could it that the impossible is compelling because we have just enough god within us to know the impossible to be achievable and just enough of ourselves within us to know that we have to rely on him to do it

in life when god calls you answer

in life when people count you out count on god and count your blessings

when the world stands against you break out your spiritual pepper spray  the promises of god

the change is a fickle thing it never works the way you want it to be hell you can only control one end of it the other end is loose and free and that other end is going to drive you nuts

it is in boldly unleashing our faith that we effectively leash our fears

i am terrified by the horrors that lurk all around me but it would do me good to remember that those same horrors are terrified by the god who resides within me

i do not feel obliged to believe that the same god who has endowed us with senses reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use and by some other means to give us knowledge which we can attain by them

people are what matters to me the most and if they need their religion to cope with their struggles of life then ill defend their right to faith with all the might in my veins no matter how many intellectual scholars speak ill of me

faith comes by hearing the quality and originality of what you hear birth your future

if i understand death as a temporary loss that is irrevocably swallowed up by the eternal existence within which it occurs i suddenly realize that it is the death of something that enriches the life of everything

prayer penetrates the underside of heaven and sends the full force of an invisible realm hurdling against the adversaries that are too naïve to understand what’s about to descend upon them

if you take a chance so will others on you

choose the positive because its all good be honest be open stop and think see the red flags let go of ego now make a healthy choice

nothing is more powerful

than faith in ourself

beating the impossible never starts when we reach for the stars rather it starts when we fall to our knees

should all the hoards of mankind assemble as one and bring the full force of their numbers against us we must remember that one man standing alone with god remains an immovable majority

regrets and mistakes help us identify areas of growth they are not meant to be dwelled on do not let them undermine your potential

my faith is in the unknown in all that we do not understand by reason i believe that what is beyond our comprehension is a simple fact in other dimensions and that in the realm of the unknown there is an infinite power for good

faith is invulnerability it feeds on stubbornness self motivation and an endless stream of will his body is mortal but the spirit of faith cannot be killed faith is oxygen that feeds the brain helping him to think sensibly

faithfully pray and god will answer our prayer that’s the part i was struggling with but then he added that god will always let us know what he wants us to do god will let you know

be carefulmind who you open up to not all sympathies are real besidesyou dont need sympathy you only need grace

id rather know a higher level of truth than continue to live a lie

great peace have those who love your law and nothing can make them stumble psalm

i had spent an entire life praying for a miracle and none had come and now i looked at the stuffy chapel of my ancestors and saw vanity and greed heard the call to prayer and thought of power smelled incense and wondered at the waste of it all

should all the hoards of mankind assemble as one and bring the full force of their numbers against us we must remember that one man standing alone with god remains an immovable majority

we have cast surrender as weak however if surrender to god makes us everything we could never be on our own then weakness would in fact be the unwillingness to surrender

hold onto your miracle

its just a spark right now

guard it from the wind that blows

ignore the tongues that wag and the clock that drags so slow

day you day the spark to a flame will grow

on a day unexpected the miracle in life will show

and whats god if not a puppeteerone who makes us danceone who craves and demands attention

when i reflect on the legacies left behind from my childhood i am indebted to acknowledge the role my mother grandmother and godmothers played in my spiritual formation and personal development

god is neither intimidated by the depth nor the height of your troubles nor is he blind to them he will show up in due time

a setback is often a prerequisite to your success not a life sentence

my heart yearns to be your heir

but my prayer remains unheard

speak to me that i may hear

and i will know that you can hear

for i need to see you here

your voice i wait to hear

your presence i seek to be near

that i may not live with fear

and i will always be your heir

and never wander like the deer

when expectations become desperation

may your might be my light

that i may see you as my guide

and do all things in your might

as i journey on with thy light

may i know who you really are

that i may know who i’m really are

as i stand between here and there

in a world that seeks to keep me here or there

so i may not be your heir

when all hope is gone

and all otherwise thoughts have come

may i smile for what you have done

as you overcome condemnation with redemption

and provide all needs for glorification

there comes a point in our lives when we must decide for ourselves will we surrender to the god of the universe and place our trust in him as our god or will we fight against him

you can live without god but to do so is to live without living

it is almost always better to take a chance and hope that your life will get better instead of ending it

of course god exists but god is no more a man than you are a snowflake

as we begin a new year let’s discard what was jaded let’s put on in its place the beautiful garments of faith hope and love

patience is a virtue they say faith is for the strong they say but i say patience and faith are for the rebels it takes radicalism to stare into eternity and not blink

the higher the stakes the stronger the faith

what chains can hold belongs to men the rest is gods

a family that eats together grows together

she looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond her situation of something not round nor before her

prayer is the humble man laying prostrate before an infinite god and although it may seem utterly ludicrous a man such as this is one of the most powerful men that you will find anywhere on the face on the earth

where you plant your feet determines your feats

more times than not the word impossible is more about my attitude and less about the reality of the situation

perhaps courage didnt come in the way you would most expect it wasnt brave heroics or pushing yourself to get through hard times

no courage was surrendering yourself to god and letting him guide you

the lines of the protagonist of my book

there is always hope

what would it take she asked for you to see a miracle instead of a coincidence it would take a miracleobviously silence said picking up her knife instead of just a coincidence

one life force connects to the holy other

always have faith to see it through

losing my faith was like losing a job i never wanted in the first place

if we were to understand all the ways of god and his workings then we would be above mortal man and god would not be god

faith is belief with its boots on

i don’t define darkness as the absence of light rather i define it as the absence of god and in that sense it’s never dark

i felt like my own heart had been flung out into the night with nothing to save it but faith in raolcan

my god my bright abyss

into which all my longing will not go

once more i come to the edge of all i know

and believing nothing believe in this

whenever i find myself losing faith in humanity i come back to the classical music they are a great reminder that we are also able to produce beautiful things made out of strong and barely controllable emotions

mental slavery of religious leader is more dangerous and blind than the slavery of political leader

because the political leader promise to turn the country into gods heaven

but religious leader promise to take followers directly into gods heaven

in walking with god it’s not about knowing the facts rather it’s about knowing the god who knows the facts

hope is a crazy thing a courageous thing faith is a bold irrational choice

faith in its forming of images of the ultimate environment never finds analogues that fully or with complete accuracy bring out and express its knowing

it wasnt the clothes that made this face this woman different it was something behind her eyes something in the set of her jawa hope or belief or convictionthat a life is not a thing unalterablei suppose it was something like faith

all art is rooted in whatever is the foundation of everything

only if we share christs death on earth will we share his life in heaven

all human creativity depends on something deeper than itself

one atom is capable of producing an atomic explosion that can unleash unfathomable destruction what if this nearly infinite potential exists in everything

faith has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with belief

how do we explain god maybe we explain him as unexplainable

to appeal to the ethos pathos and logos is naught lest the soesos appeals for the faith of the parts of the whole in their spirit

the only real practical measure of my appreciation for the goodness and mercy of god to me is the extent to which i am in turn prepared to show goodness and mercy to others

your physical position does not determine your spiritual condition through faith our spiritual position determines our physical condition

some days are sweetened with pure but fleeting joy just keep keeping on

some days consist of a kind of sorrow that tries to break you just keep keeping on

some days are filled with bright warm light that clearly shows the path to follow just keep keeping on

some days are filled with calm and peace just keep keeping on

some days are filled with a violent commotion that does its best to disrupt our innermost harmony just keep keeping on

some days we must just take a rest until we can once again keep keeping on

some days are filled with hope and faith and the recognition of a journey we wouldnt trade for anything and so we keep keeping on

we all are struggling with the tension of believing or expecting things which we cannot prove

the higher the intelligence the more faith and the less credulity gabriel rejects

more than we but outbelieves us all

god had shown her that he was not simply overseeing her journey but that he was her journey the realization had not taken away the pain but had brought her a tremendous amount of peace

much of our effort to do things for the lord is really the resurgence of our desire to dominate and make things happen in our own strength

the father made men curious some say to test our faith it is my own abiding sin that whenever i come upon a door i must needs see what lies upon the farther side but certain doors are best left unopened

it was that initial leap of utter faith that initial lurch into motion that had my limbs locking up

the high septon was the true king of westeros in all but name

a belief is your brain’s selfmaintenance mechanism

in god’s providence we have four gospels for jesus christ is too great and glorious a person to be captured by one author or one perspective

the purpose of a belief is selfpreservation

if you have faith in all the trinities and apostles in the world and still have no faith in yourself there is no salvation for you

we are to be like christ in his incarnation

woman get to the throne room shun the phone booththe solution is in the throne room

souls are won for christ by tears and sweat and pain especially in prayer and in sacrificial personal friendship

the lyrics that i sing in my head dictate the attitude of my heart and because that’s the case i’d prefer the music of god to the songs of men

if you can dream it or imagine it then you can do it

i know god will not give me anything i cant handle i just wish that he didnt trust me so much

the gods hate man’s arrogance the septons teach us and the sevenpointed star says that pride goes before a fall

religion can always be put to sleep

faith cant

people are doing the best that they can even if it appears they are not

it is the man without vision who sees only an ending yet it is the man of faith who sees an ending as the very place from which a thousand beginnings will be birthed

with purity of heart you can overcome any problem

explore the eternity of your existence

god is not present everywhere by being identical to everything in the universe as in pantheism god is not dispersed through the universe like an invisible gas instead god is present in the universe by sustaining and affecting every part of it

people who say literature doesnt matter there are three books from the middle east that are still shaping the world many centuries later

prayers maybe most of them go unanswered you two you’re too young too fortunate to know that you will prayers go unanswered not god’s fault people keep getting in his way

holiness is the holy fire

holiness is a holy fire

holiness is the only weapon capable of pulling down the stronghold of hell

just as jesus performed what in his culture was the work of a slave so we in our cultures must regard no task too menial or degrading to undertake

dont give up on your faith just to please someone who has no faith at all

that is like giving up a treasure to please someone who has none

any movement or sound is a profession of faith

as the millstone grinding is explaining

how it believes in the river

no metaphor can explain this

but i cannot stop pointing to the beauty

every moment and place says

put this design in your carpet

i want to be in such a passionate adoration

that my tent gets pitched against the sky

let the beloved come

in front of the tent

when the ocean surges

dont let me just hear it

let is splash inside my chest

i am the prayer

doubt can paralyze you can make you not want to do anything but if you learn to channel it to turn those feelings away from yourself and out at the world you can doubt whats impossible

dont seek to become better than any other man be just and be good

for god measures not individuals achievements nor goals

god will judge you by your heart so everything you do

do it in a hearty manner

you have to believe me without proof thats what faith is — believing without proof

i envied her for her faith which had kept her strong and helped her resist the same pressures i had surrendered to … this woman i realized loved god so much that she feared disappointing him more than she feared death

pray the way you likebut with faith and believe in your prayerswe have to realise that while praying we are dealing with great power which resides within usany and all techniques which enable us to direct our flow of this power can be applied

i think i can show them the path out i understand now that it’s not a question of faith or hope it exists and we can find it it’s going to take some time though

for this is the cause why we be not all in ease of heart and soul that we seek here rest in those things that are so little wherein is no rest and know not our god that is allmighty allwise allgood for he is the very rest

the man who honors all the gods honors none at all

one touch one kiss and a leap of faith  the heart will forever be claimed

in life there are bound to be difficult times dont lose hope keep trying

my dry heart soaks in a dance of raindrops

absorbs the water and inhales the smell

i am back from heaven and content

i live i love i laugh…again

excerpted from healed by rain chapter resilience

i’ll pray to god to give me strength and patience

i’ll feel no pain no vengeance no regrets

and i will learn to love again…myself this time

excerpted from my kind of resilience chapter resilience

i’ll celebrate the waltz of stars in endless harmony

i’ll dream with my angels in far away lands

and i will send love letters to my future self

excerpted from my kind of resilience chapter resilience

i’ll feel the magic in the blissful daylight

i’ll listen to the cheerful songs of nature

and i will heal my soul with joy and love

excerpted from my kind of resilience chapter resilience

i’ll take the sadness in my eyes and bury it into depths

i’ll withstand with courage every shadow of my harmful past

and i will never lose again just learn and win

excerpted from my kind of resilience chapter resilience

i chose to

explore the senses of this delightful universe

breathe the sensations of my body with every move

abandon myself in flow and feel compassion

become aware of my existence

and thank lord for his blessings on me…

excerpted from mindfulness chapter resilience

start the day with praise

live the rest with righteous deeds

and ends them with thanksgiving

i thought nothing cant stop the pleasure of sinning

until i praise god and sing thanksgiving

i chose to

float in contentment and forgive all the deep pains

accept the shadows of my queer past

encounter faith and that magic love from within

enrich my spirit with graceful emotions of who i am

listen to the essence of life and collect its charm

cultivate the fascinating practice of spiritual wellbeing

excerpted from mindfulness chapter resilience

you must have complete faith in your love because true love is pure and honest do not ever spoil your love by doubting it

urgent haste will not make things better

for it takes patience and time for a series of actions

the length of life is the same amount of your chances

trust is never enough when it does not contain confidence

faith is what you need a prerequisite for hope and love

heart doesnt really breaks it is only a feeling

painful but that is how the process of giving you a heart of a better shape

dont be trick by wrong saying or false advice

just pray and ask wise counsel to our lord

a gold ring will never looks beautiful if it wasnt burn melted struck and fashioned first

postmoderns will not swallow ideology just because someone said it tastes good cynicism is often their obstacle but also it protects their hearts from further betrayal they can sniff a sham a mile away

just because you go into it with your eyes wide open doesn’t mean you see what’s coming

what does it mean to practice faith well while our works cannot save us our habits can strengthen our faith

the righteous will claim sole domain on judgement the righteous are the first to make hands into fists the first to shout down dissenters the first to bully others into compliance

keep it simple keep it real

faith is embracing the invisible simply because the invisible is the precursor to everything that is visible therefore to lack faith is to lack everything

the ego wants to rule but the heart will quietly prevail

trying to mix the right shade of blue to paint the ocean sky not quite sure how it will turn out jumping into something new here like a big ocean of newness

it matters not which route we take traveling the path towards healing what matters is that we arrive at our destination

when we start attracting the right people and opportunities into our life we just have to be thankful that the universe is functioning properlyand that we are functioning as we were designed to do so

sometimes you just have to have faith in your own ideas if you dont someone else will why should it be them and not you the only difference is who is willing to take a chance

following the light in the sky this christmas season it illuminates hearts hidden by egos

energy healing is like defragmenting your hard drive the scattered pieces of yourself become whole again

hold on keep trying dont give up even when you think you cant

the pursuit of peace and happiness does not require status power possession or event diligent spiritual practice

it simply require unquestioning faith in whatever god or forces you believe control your destiny

and the ability to hold unconditional indiscriminate love within your heart

you are being called to be an agent of the divine will you accept your mission

there will be no end to theological book publishing because the bible is the living word and as we study it our hearts minds and soul evolves especially from a simple to a more complex around it

everything is always in relationship in fact you could almost say that everything is made of relationship in a sense

you are as strong as you believe yourself to be

good works are not the cause of our salvation good works are the evidence of our salvation faith in christ always results in good works obedience to god is the mark of true saving faith

demons have faith but they tremble

trust is what i give to others out of the hope that they will give it back to me but too often the return on such an investment is that it doesn’t return

frankly speaking i could care less if my plans succeed however i do care if god’s plans do therefore none of myself and all of god is the plan

you can’t lose faith

but you can confuse it

by not using it

do we really think if we do not pray the appropriately worded prayer god may not hear us and we will not receive an answer

but in the midst of all that uncertainty and lack of clarity there lies a wild beauty a hope possibility the promise of something bigger than us happening just beneath the surface that we can’t see

living in the kingdom of god is a matter of living with gods action in our lives

i pray each day that change comes and that more help be made available here in the us to burn survivors and their family members i also pray that it does not take another war to open peoples eyes and move their hearts

the essence of discipleship is union with christ which means identification with him in both his sufferings and his glory

sometimes no is the most loving gentle answer god can give

in no way does god’s absence call his existence into question to the contrary his absence calls into question my unwillingness to surrender to his existence

are you then the god of white people and if we who are brown worship you do we receive your blessings as white men do

i pray that you be not white that you be without color and that you be in all men because goodness cannot be encased only in white

feeling yourself as a beautiful person trust yourself love yourself love others and above all love god

god is just as merciful in the things he does not allow as he is in the things he does

sometimes the blessing is in the prayer not being answered

religion is an ancient method of governing

keep the faith

following jesus may be personal but it is never private

according to jesus examples discipleship is not a program we launch it is a lifestyle we embrace

the first step in achieving anything is the belief that you can

i will always look for what my eyes cain’t see

faith in our time can seem like signing on the dotted line of a prefab doctrine composed of absurdities

music melts the soul misery

if they wish to love god they be prepared to do so no matter what his intentions god is not just god is not kind god is not merciful and understanding that is essential to true devotion

this is what i’m for this moment fade by kailin gow

if the god who crafted each of those

twinkling stars cared for him like the bible promised everything

would work out he’d just have to have faith  brandon

kingdoms come and go but the word stays true  kailin gow fearless fairy tales series
