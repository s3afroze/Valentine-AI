born out of compassion for all beings

wisdom but we cannot escape the necessity of love and compassion

for temple or church for mosque or synagogue no need for complicated

philosophy doctrine or dogma our own heart our own mind is the temple

the doctrine is compassion love for others and respect for their rights and

dignity no matter who or what they are ultimately these are all we need

so long as we practice these in our daily lives then no matter if we are

learned or unlearned whether we believe in buddha or god or follow some

other religion or none at all as long as we have compassion for others and

conduct ourselves with restraint out of a sense of responsibility there is

no doubt we will be happy

pity the nation that is full of beliefs and empty of religion

pity the nation that wears a cloth it does not weave

and eats a bread it does not harvest

pity the nation that acclaims the bully as hero

and that deems the glittering conqueror bountiful

yet submits in its awakening

pity the nation that raises not its voice

save when it walks in a funeral

boasts not except among its ruins

and will rebel not save when its neck is laid

between the sword and the block

pity the nation whose statesman is a fox

whose philosopher is a juggler

and whose art is the art of patching and mimicking

pity the nation that welcomes its new ruler with trumpeting

and farewells him with hooting

only to welcome another with trumpeting again

pity the nation whose sages are dumb with years

and whose strongmen are yet in the cradle

pity the nation divided into fragments

each fragment deeming itself a nation

the classroom remained silent

langdon winked open your minds my friends we all fear what we do not understand

the way is not in the sky the way is in the heart

forgive me for being so ordinary while claiming to know so extraordinary a god

and tasted the eternal joys of heaven

am not tormented with ten thousand hells

in being deprived of everlasting bliss

out of  men one will read the bible the other  will read the christian

christians are hard to tolerate i don’t know how jesus does it

i like the silent church before the service begins better than any preaching

most world religions denounced war as a barbaric waste of human life we treasured the teachings of these religions so dearly that we frequently had to wage war in order to impose them on other people

since alice had never received any religious instruction and since she had led a blameless life she never thought of her awful luck as being anything but accidents in a very busy place good for her

the idea of god infinity or spirit stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception

shepherd book what are we up to sweetheart

gods gifts put mens best dreams to shame

even when god seemed to have abandoned me he was watching even when he seemed indifferent to my suffering he was watching and when i was beyond all hope of saving he gave me rest then he gave me a sign to continue my journey

like when you sit in front of a fire in winter — you are just there in front of the fire you dont have to be smart or anything the fire warms you

god is the color of water water doesnt have a color

your beliefs will be the light by which you see but they will not be what you see and they will not be a substitute for seeing

but fate as merlin always taught us is inexorable life is a jest of the gods merlin liked to claim and there is no justice you must learn to laugh he once told me or else youll just weep yourself to death

there is no religion without love

and people may talk as much as

they like about their religion but

if it does not teach them to be good

and kind to man and beast

it is all a sham

see this is why im not religious i couldnt possibly keep my mouth shut long enough to get along with everyone else

people who fit don’t seek the seekers are those that don’t fit

a persons character is shown through their actions in life not where they sit on sunday

why worry about minor little details like clean air clean water safe ports and the safety net when jesus is going to give the world an extreme makeover planet edition right after he finishes putting satan in his place once and for all

i held my heart back from positively accepting anything since i was afraid of another fall and in this condition of suspense i was being all the more killed

there once was a time when all people believed in god and the church ruled this time was called the dark ages

science can teach us and i think our hearts can teach us no longer to look around for imaginary supporters no longer to invent allies in the sky but rather to look to our own efforts here below to make the world a fit place to live

was there ever a more horrible blasphemy than the statement that all the knowledge of god is confined to this or that book how dare men call god infinite and yet try to compress him within the covers of a little book

yet the ivory gods and the ebony gods and the gods of diamondjade are only silly puppet gods that people themselves have made

it is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil if they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui

it’s a strange myth that atheists have nothing to live for it’s the opposite we have nothing to die for we have everything to live for

god is the supreme uncreated light of which wisdom is born but there was never a time when gods wisdom did not exist

hobbies of any kind are boring except to people who have the same hobby this is also true of religion although you will not find me saying so in print

we are the bibles the world is reading we are the creeds the world is needing we are the sermons the world is heeding

dont measure the size of the mountain talk to the one who can move it

and why does this same god tell me how to raise my children when he had to drown his

science adjusts its views based on whats observed

faith is the denial of observation so that belief can be preserved

be a man what good is religion if it collapses under calamity think of what earthquakes and floods wars and volcanoes have done before to men did you think that god had exempted us he is not an insurance agent

some of us look for the way in opium and some in god some of us in whiskey and some in love it is all the same way and it leads nowhither

i was thinking about how people seem to read the bible a lot more as they get older and then it dawned on me—they’re cramming for their final exam

you cant teach an old dogma new tricks

if god is for us who can be against us

this most beautiful system of the sun planets and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being

this being governs all things not as the soul of the world but as lord over all and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called lord god παντοκρατωρ or universal ruler

so india’s problem turns out to be the world’s problem what happened in india has happened in god’s name

the problem’s name is god

faith is at one and the same time absolutely necessary and altogether impossible

myth is what we call other peoples religion

a true opium of the people is a belief in nothingness after death  the huge solace of thinking that for our betrayals greed cowardice murders we are not going to be judged

republicans are for both the man and the dollar but in case of conflict the man before the dollar

he who has rejected his demons badgers us to death with his angels

the mind of god is greater than all the minds of men so let all men leave the gospel just as god has delivered it unto us

i am striving to give back the divine in myself to the divine in the all

those who are without compassion cannot see what is seen with the eyes of compassion

my father chose my name  and my last name was chosen by my ancestors  that’s enough i myself choose my way

my country is the world and my religion is to do good

hope is a passion for the possible

he who defends with love will be secure heaven will save him and protect him with love

the trouble with being a god is that youve got no one to pray to

to my way of thinking there is every bit as much evidence for the

existence of ufos as there is for the existence of god probably far

more at least in the case of ufos there have been countless taped

and filmed and by the way unexplained sightings from all over the

world along with documented radar evidence seen by experienced

military and civilian radar operators

there were a lot of gods gods always come in handy they justify almost anything

gods dont like people not doing much work people who arent busy all the time might start to think

doubts are the ants in the pants of faith they keep it awake and moving

dont you love jesus well i thought an i thought an finally i says no i dont know nobody name jesus i know a bunch of stories but i only love people

in the bible it says you have to forgive seventy times seven i want you all to know im keeping a chart

i want jesus to come back and say thats not what i meant

i think it is very good when people suffer to me that is like the kiss of jesus

man is manifestly not the measure of all things this universe is shot through with mystery the very fact of its being and of our own is a mystery absolute and the only miracle worthy of the name

anyone who says he knows gods intention is showing a lot of very human ego

i knew then that i hadnt stopped believing in god id just stopped believing god cared there might be a god clary and there might not but i dont think it matters either way were on our own

i studied every page of this book and i didnt find enough love to fill a salt shaker god is not love in the bible god is vengeance from alpha to omega

i wouldnt burden any decent system of faith by participating in it im not agnostic just nonpartisan theological switzerland thats me

the immature think that knowledge and action are different but the wise see them as the same

i think religion is a neurological disorder

have faith in god and in yourself that will cure all hope for the best expect the best toil for the best and everything will come right for you in the end

in order to know who you are you need to know god is

jesus was not the man he was as a result of making jesus christ his personal savior

islam expect every muslim to do this duty and if we realise our responsibility time will come soon when we shall justify ourselves worthy of a glorious past

religion is the opium of the poor

it seemed there was always a close correlation between true believers and high body counts

faith is not so much something we believe faith is something we live

men take care not to make women weep for god counts their tears

we know enough at this moment to say that the god of abraham is not only unworthy of the immensity of creation he is unworthy even of man

the fact that my continuous and public rejection of christianity does not worry me in the least should suggest to you just how inadequate i think your reasons for being a christian are

the secret of a good sermon is to have a good beginning and a good ending and to have the two as close together as possible

i respect you as a person too much to respect your ridiculous beliefs

whole life is a search for beauty but when the beauty is found inside the search ends and a beautiful journey begins

all the cunning of the devil is exercised in trying to tear us away from the word

if there is no laughter jesus has gone somewhere else if there is no joy and freedom it is not a church it is simply a crowd of melancholy people basking in a religious neurosis if there is no celebration there is no real worship

listen god love everything you love  and a mess of stuff you dont but more than anything else god love admiration

you saying god vain i ast

naw she say not vain just wanting to share a good thing i think it pisses god off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and dont notice it

what it do when it pissed off i ast

oh it make something else people think pleasing god is all god care about but any fool living in the world can see it always trying to please us back

when one loses the deep intimate relationship with nature then temples mosques and churches become important

if god would have wanted us to live in a permissive society he would have given us ten suggestions and not ten commandments

but to mean it when i say that i want my life to count for his glory is to drive a stake through the heart of self  a painful and determined dying to me that must be a part of every day i live

men are made for happiness and he who is completely happy has the right to say to himself i am doing gods will on earth

are your convictions so fragile that mine cannot stand in opposition to them is your god so illusory that the presence of my devil reveals his insufficiency

o god — please give him back i shall keep asking you

pakistan not only means freedom and independence but the muslim ideology which has to be preserved which has come to us as a precious gift and treasure and which we hope other will share with us

do what you do only for gods sake start for gods sake work for gods sake and act within the sphere of gods good approval

the story of my family  changes with the teller

reason is a whore the greatest enemy that faith has it never comes to the aid of spiritual things but more frequently than not struggles against the divine word treating with contempt all that emanates from god

if you want to be reminded of the love of the lord just watch the sunrise

the religion of one age is the literary entertainment of the next

in the year  a person can have sufficient intellectual and material resources to build a nuclear bomb and still believe that he will get seventytwo virgins in paradise

come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light

i was born a heretic i always distrusted people who know so much about what god wants them to do to their fellows

if goodness has causes it is not goodness if it has effects a reward it is not goodness either so goodness is outside the chain of cause and effect

religious people fear hell  spiritual people have walked thru it

your cravings as a human animal do not become a prayer just because it is god whom you ask to attend to them

if merely feeling good could decide drunkenness would be the supremely valid human experience

please god im only fourteen years old a teenager have mercy be loving

i was says god for eons and look at what it got me you

and olvos said to them why have you done this my children why is the sky wreathed with smoke why have you made war in far places and shed blood in strange lands

and olvos was silent

mayonnaise one of the sauces which serve the french in place of a state religion

morality is a matter of money poor people cannot afford to have morals so they have religion

that we shall die

yes theres really only one question that can be answered genry and we already know the answer  the only thing that makes life possible is permanent intolerable uncertainty not knowing what comes next

where questions of religion are concerned people are guilty of every possible sort of dishonesty and intellectual misdemeanor

pray to god but row towards shore

people no longer try to decipher the mystery of life but choose instead to be a part of it

spiritual realization is theoretically the easiest thing and in practice the most difficult thing there is it is the easiest because it is enough to think of god it is the most difficult because human nature is forgetfulness of god

if god created us in his own image we have more than reciprocated

but for me the sweetest contact with god has no form i close my eyes look within and enter a deep soft silence the infinity of gods creation embraces me

im sorry if any of you are catholic im not sorry if youre offended im actually just sorry by the fact that youre catholic

therefore since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us be thankful and so worship god acceptably with reverence and awe for our god is a consuming fire

the rabbit of easter he bring of the chocolate

the church should just stay out of peoples pants

don’t be disheartened by the forces of evil nothing can happen that god hasn’t allowed even resistance is all part of grand orchestration the devil always has you right were god wants you

i dont believe in an afterlife so i dont have to spend my whole life fearing hell or fearing heaven even more for whatever the tortures of hell i think the boredom of heaven would be even worse

i will not attack your doctrines nor your creeds if they accord liberty to me if they hold thought to be dangerous  if they aver that doubt is a crime then i attack them one and all because they enslave the minds of men

i attack the monsters the phantoms of imagination that have ruled the world i attack slavery i ask for room  room for the human mind

i can only say that i am nothing but a poor sinner trusting in christ alone for salvation

god’s word is not just to be heard and repeated it is to be breathed lived and emulated with each action

once you have surrendered yourself you make yourself receptive in receiving from god you are perfected and completed

when man is with god in awe and love then he is praying

what we do in every other area of our lives other than religion is rather than respect somebodys beliefs we evaluate their reasons

the bible looks like it started out as a game of mad libs

my mind tells me ill never understand god

my heart tells me im not meant to

man…who lives in three places – in the past in the present and in the future – can be unhappy if one of these three is worthless religion has even added a fourth – eternity

it all depends on what people youre talking about helping thats the wonderful think about just about every religion on the planet  theyre all so incredibly selfish

in the beginning man created god and in the image of man created he him

a belief is not true because it is useful

he saw that science had become as great a hoax as religion that nationalism was a farce patriotism a fraud education a form of leprosy and that morals were for cannibals

i dreamt of worldly success once

no gods or kings only man andrew ryan

how dismal it is to see present day americans yearning for the very orthodoxy that their country was founded to escape

the purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of europe in blood for centuries

letter objecting to the use of government land for churches

don’t tell me about your god with your words show me about your god with your actions

i try to deny myself any illusions or delusions and i think that this perhaps entitles me to try and deny the same to others at least as long as they refuse to keep their fantasies to themselves

we choose our next world through what we learn in this one learn nothing and the next world is the same as this one all the same limitations and lead weights to overcome

reply to the diet of worms april

kindness has no religion religions are like narrow tracks but kindness is like an open sky

god not only loves the obedient  he enlightens them

there is nothing inhuman evil or irrational which does not give some comfort provided it is shared by a group

faith is a fine invention

when gentlemen can see

but microscopes are prudent

in an emergency

like those in the valley behind us most people stand in sight of the spiritual mountains all their lives and never enter them being content to listen to others who have been there and thus avoid the hardships

dont follow a defeated foe follow christ it is costly you will be an exile in this age but you will be free

when asked why i dont believe in god i reply quite simply vaginas

indeed its futile to try and use holy scripture to support any political position i deeply distrust anyone who does just look at what an islamic republic is like

for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is everlasting life in christ jesus or lord

nell did not imagine that constable moore wanted to get into a detailed discussion of recent events so she changed the subject i think i have finally worked out what you were trying to tell me years ago about being intelligent she said

the constable brightened all at once pleased to hear it

they believe it the constable said because they have been indoctrinated to believe it

yes some of them never challenge it– they grow up to be smallminded people who can tell you what they believe but not why they believe it others become disillusioned by the hypocrisy of the society and rebel– as did elizabeth finklemcgraw

which path do you intend to take nell said the constable sounding very interested conformity or rebellion

neither one both ways are simpleminded– they are only for people who cannot cope with contradiction and ambiguity

what we call rational grounds for our beliefs are often extremely irrational attempts to justify our instincts

the first quality of an honest man is contempt for religion which would have us afraid of the most natural thing in the world which is death and would have us hate the one beautiful thing destiny has given us which is life

you must worship the self in krishna not krishna as krishna

obviously all religions fall far short of their own ideals

who are your favorite heroines in real life the women of afghanistan iraq and iran who risk their lives and their beauty to defy the foulness of theocracy ayaan hirsi ali and azar nafisi as their ideal feminine model

there are few things more dangerous than inbred religious certainty

the tempter or the tempted who sins most

if you gave jerry falwell an enema he could be buried in a matchbox

politics the art of using euphemisms lies emotionalism and fearmongering to dupe average people into acceptingor even demandingtheir own enslavement

we must remember that the test of our religious principles lies not just in what we say not only in our prayers not even in living blameless lives  but in what we do for others

what we want is not more little books about christianity but more little books by christians on other subjectswith their christianity latent

no idea is above scrutiny and no people are beneath dignity

religion is for those who dont want to go to hell and spirituality is for those who have already been there

people go to church for the same reasons they go to a tavern to stupefy themselves to forget their misery to imagine themselves for a few minutes anyway free and happy

circular letter to my friends in italy

religions just a welloiled profitdriven denial of the randomness of it all

i have church on sunday

of course you do

you’re welcome to come along

thanks but i’m allergic to incense

that’s a shame

it’s the bane of my existence

beth and jake

the danger is that in reaction to abuses and distortions of an idea well reject it completely and in the process miss out on the good of it the worth of it the truth of it

i guess if i had to pick a spiritual figurehead to possess the deed to the entirety of earth id go with buddha but only because he wouldnt want it

what i wanted to express very clearly and intensely was that the reason these people had to invent or imagine heroes and gods is pure fear fear of life and fear of death

sometimes the crime follows the punishment which only serves to prove the foresight of the great god

thats what my grandmother used to say said brutha automatically

indeed i would like to know more about this formidable lady

she used to give me a thrashing every morning because i would certainly do something to deserve it during the day said brutha

a most complete understanding of the nature of mankind

living in a world such as this is like dancing on a live volcano

be brave be free from philosophies prophets and holy lies go deep into your feelings and explore the mystery of your body mind and soul you will find the truth

you got to realize youre the devil as much as youre god

isnt this enough just this world just this

i am for freedom of religion and against all maneuvers to bring about a legal ascendency of one sect over another

the christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake

aum or om is not related to any religion because om was practiced before the birth of all the religions of the world

science is observing truth in the light of head religion is observing truth in the light of heart humanity is using both the lights and education is developing that humanity

eskimo if i did not know about god and sin would i go to hell priest no not if you did not know eskimo then why did you tell me

well so it must be for as man saw reality so it became

you never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion    only man behaves with such gratuitous folly it is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not as yet quite intelligent enough

the gods too are fond of a joke

as soon as a religion comes to dominate it has as its opponents all those who would have been its first disciples

when you arent sincere you need to pretend and by pretending you end up believing yourself thats the basic principle of every faith

as for mother eve  i wasnt there and cant deny the story but i will say this if she brought evil into the world we men have had the lions share of keeping it going ever since

they are not mad theyre trained to believe not to know belief can be manipulated only knowledge is dangerous

thats the funny thing about religion it doesnt matter what you say youre going to upset someone

you believe in god demanded billy karma

i believe in thirtyseven separate and distinct gods answered argyle proudly that puts me thirtysix ahead of you

it makes you a pagan

it makes you a man of limited vision said argyle

though i was born a hindu i solemnly assure you that i will not die as a hindu

without suffering theres no happiness so we shouldnt discriminate against the mud we have to learn how to embrace and cradle our own suffering and the suffering of the world with a lot of tenderness

we should have a state in which we could live and breathe as free men and which we could develop according to our own lights and culture and where principles of islamic social justice could find free play

all i require of a religion is that it be tolerant of those who do not agree with it

once youve condoned faith in general youve condoned any crazy shit done because of faith

remarks to the greater houston ministerial association september

the anatomy of conflict

no man is great enough or wise enough for any of us to surrender our destiny to the only way in which anyone can lead us is to restore to us the belief in our own guidance

if you have to say or do something controversial aim so that people will hate that they love it and not love that they hate it

we are not human beings on a spiritual journey we are spiritual beings on a human journey

what’s the good of being true to your religion on the outside if you don’t change what’s on the insidewere it really counts

to be a christian is to live dangerously honestly freely  to step in the name of love as if you may land on nothing yet to keep on stepping because the something that sustains you no empire can give you and no empire can take away

everything of value that people get from religion can be had more honestly without presuming anything on insufficient evidence the rest is selfdeception set to music

the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my shield and the horn of my salvation my stronghold

religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise every expanded prospect

letter to william bradford jr april

to a bornagain atheist like myself it is clear that each of us has multiple selves talents perceptions but to the roman catholic unity is all

it is a better world a place where we ate responsible for our actions where we can be kind to one another because we want to and becauseit is the right thing to do instead of being frightened into behaving by the threat of divine punishment

if there was a god id still have both nuts

so may the outward shows be least themselves

the world is still deceived with ornament

in law what plea so tainted and corrupt

but being seasoned with a gracious voice

obscures the show of evil in religion

what damned error but some sober brow

will bless it and approve it with a text

hiding the grossness with fair ornament

there is no vice so simple but assumes

some mark of virtue on his outward parts

have patience all things are difficult before they become easy

national identity is the last bastion of the dispossessed but the meaning of identity is now based on hatred on hatred for those who are not the same

in our loss and fear we craved the acts of religion the ceremonies that allow us to admit our helplessness our dependence on the great forces we do not understand

aim high aim at the highest and all lower aims are thereby achieved it is looking below on the stormy sea of differences that makes you sink look up beyond these and see the one glorious real and you are saved

why i cant help wondering is god thought to need such ferocious

defence one might have supposed him amply capable of looking

after himself

there seemed to be some correlation between devotion to god and a misguided zeal for marshmallows

the shadowmaker shapes forever

the trouble with communism is the communists just as the trouble with christianity is the christians

being a vampire is not a curse it’s a disease tessa filled in but they still can’t enter hallowed ground then does that mean they’re damned

that depends on what you believe said jem and whether you believe in damnation at all

but you hunt demons you must believe in damnation

i believe in good and evil said jem and i believe the soul is eternal i don’t believe in the fiery pit the pitchforks or the endless torment i do not believe you can threaten people into goodness

truth in matters of religion is simply the opinion that has survived

down with hell and heaven and all the religious fuss

infinity pleased our parents

he is not supposed to reason hence so long as you are in the hindu religion you cannot expect to have freedom of thought

deliverance is not for me in renunciation i feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight

i expressed these ideas long before the behaviorists led by pavlov in russia and by watson in the united states proclaimed their new psychology this apparently mechanistic conception is not antagonistic to an ethical conception of life

people who change their religion should face the death penalty

as for biblical or religious theory i don’t ever want to fight about the details of the story i want to live the reality of the message

i wonder that religion can live or die on the strength of a faint stirring breeze the scent trail shifts causing the predator to miss the pounce one god draws in the breath of life and rises another god expires

for all works and things which are either commanded or forbidden by god and thus have been instituted by the

supreme majesty are musts nevertheless no one should be dragged to them or away from them by the hair for i can drive no man to heaven or beat him into it with a club

for me religion is like a rhinoceros i dont have one and id really prefer not to be trampled by yours

black and white

i was born into

but with so many other

religions and

how do i know which

is it not

my birthright

to seek out the light

to find truth

after surveying all the proof

am i supposed

to love

or fight

and why do all those who

try to guide me

always start by dividing

and multiplying me –

from what they consider

wrong or right

there were no walls

for whoever beams truth and light

and how can one speak on lights behalf

lf all they do

but talk white

finaly my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil

the mentally disturbed do not employ the principle of scientific parsimony the most simple theory to explain a given set of facts they shoot for the baroque

some folks are happier not being saved

what people really believe doesnt feel like a belief it feels like the way the world is

there are hardly any excesses of the most crazed psychopath that cannot easily be duplicated by a normal kindly family man who just comes in to work every day and has a job to do

he who does not reflect his life back to god in gratitude does not know himself

do not worry in the least about yourself leave all worry to god  this appears to be the commandment in all religions

the problem with religion because its been sheltered from criticism is that it allows people to believe en masse what only idiots or lunatics could believe in isolation

when you see a man with a great deal of religion displayed in his shop window you may depend upon it he keeps a very small stock of it within

he was very religious he believed that he had a secret pact with god which exempted him from doing good in exchange for prayers and piety

your least favorite virtue or nominee for the most overrated one faith closely followed—in view of the overall shortage of time—by patience

the faith is not the problem bernadette the problem is the faithful

the average man who does not know what to do with his life wants another one which will last forever

you can have jesus in your spirit and have an outrageous mess in your soul and if you dont know what thats called its called religion

saying someone is religious is heard in most of america as a compliment a reassuring affirmation that someone will be moral ethical and after a few glasses of wine a freak in the bedroom

without the support from religionremember we talked about itno father using only his own resources would be able to bring up a child

the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake an almost fanatical love of justice and the desire for personal independence  these are the features of the jewish tradition which make me thank my stars that i belong to it

still amazes me that people spend more time researching a new vehicle than they do the religion they entrust their souls to

when people have invested their identities into clichés the only counter argument they have is being offended

they will become godly when they will have god in their hearts

today evolution of human intelligence has advanced us to the stage where most of us are too smart to invent new gods but are reluctant to give up the old ones

and if you would know god be not therefore a solver of riddles

rather look about you and you shall see him playing with your children

and look into space you shall see him walking in the cloud outstretching his arms in the lightning and descending in rain

you shall see him smiling in flowers then rising and waving his hands in trees

neither pagan nor mahamedan nor jew ought to be excluded from the civil rights of the commonwealth because of his religion quoting john lockes argument

what im asking you to entertain is that there is nothing we need to believe on insufficient evidence in order to have deeply ethical and spiritual lives

you dont get to advertise all the good that your religion does without first scrupulously subtracting all the harm it does and considering seriously the question of whether some other religion or no religion at all does better

she was a fool and so am i and so is anyone who thinks he sees what god is doing writes bokonon

i cant understand why people use religion to hurt each other when theres already so much pain in the world

you can disagree with another persons opinions you can disagree with their doctrines you cant disagree with their experience

faith is an organ of knowledge and love an organ of experience

he that has doctrinal knowledge and speculation only without affection never is engaged in the business of religion

there are many sources of spirituality religion may be the most common but it is by no means the only anything that generates a sense of awe may be a source of spirituality science does this in spades

i always like a dog so long as he isnt spelled backward

mine was a patchwork god sewn together from bits of rag and ribbon eastern and western pagan and hebrew everything but the kitchen sink and jesus

in the midst of the affliction he counsels strengthens confirms nourishes and favors us more over when we have repented he instantly remits the sins as well as the punishments in the same manner parents ought to handle their children

the aim of all christian education moreover is to train the believer in an adult faith that can make him a new creation capable of bearing witness in his surroundings to the christian hope that inspires him

man created god in his image intolerant sexist homophobic and violent

true religion should be able to respond to the dark melodies the faulty and hideous sounds that echo from the heart of men

nobody understands the nature of the church or the ringing note of the creed descending from antiquity who does not realize that the whole world once very nearly died of broadmindedness and the brotherhood of all religions

a man must be prepared not only to be a martyr but to be a fool it is absurd to say that a man is ready to toil and die for his convictions if he is not even ready to wear a wreathe around his head for them

we are not as christcentered and crosscherishing as we should be because we do not ponder the truth that everything good and everything bad that god turns for the good was purchased by the sufferings of christ

a religion that takes no account of practical affairs and does not help to solve them is no religion

the white folks like for us to be religious then they can do what they want to with us

the most difficult dilemma for a person is perhaps when his heart testifies to an inevitable reality yet his tongue will not proclaim it when his mind screams in acceptance of truth but he cant bring himself to state it

common men talk bagfuls of religion but do not practise even a grain of it the wise man speaks a little even though his whole life is religion expressed in action

i couldnt get him out of my head still cant i spent three solid days thinking about him the more he bothered me the less i coul forget him and the more i learned about him the less i wanted to leave him

you will judas my brother god will give you the strength as much as you lack because it is necessary—it is necessary for me to be killed and for you to betray me we two must save the world help me

judas bowed his head after a moment he asked if you had to betray your master would you do it

jesus reflected for a long time finally he said no im afraid i wouldnt be able to that is why god pitied me and gave me the easier task to be crucified

what looks like politics and imagines itself to be political will one day unmask itself as a religious movement

the death of god left the angels in a strange position

if a believer demands that i as a nonbeliever observe his taboos in the public domain he is not asking for my respect but for my submission

fanatics can justify practically any atrocity to themselves the more untenable their position becomes the harder they hold to it and the worse the things they are willing to do to support it

they say religion is about love but you wonder how much of it really is about fear

let me assure you that my intent is not to offend or merely be provocative im simply worried

there are plenty of good reasons for fighting i said but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too

change is not what we expect from religious people they tend to love the past more than the present or the future

really its like the spirits have made a deal with us

and what is the deal i asked

like a note youd send somebody after you stayed in their house

exactly like that thanks for letting me sleep on your couch i took some beer out of the refrigerator and i broke a coffee cup sorry i hope it wasnt your favorite one

no religion is perfect not after man gets through with it

faith is believing in something you know isnt true

im catholic i dont pray i just ask for forgiveness after

and i nephi took one of the daughters of ishmael to wife well mr goanddo just went and did

believe what you believe and it will be

believe what others believe and they will consume you

if i were asked for a onesentence sound

bite on religion i would say i was against it

when we passed a catholic church i recalled he said you think your dads a good chemist theyre turning soda crackers into meat in there can your dad do that

maybe if i had to boil it down to one easy sentence it would be this i believe in evolution and i believe in god i just havent worked out the details yet

the only thing more dangerous than an idea is a belief and by dangerous i dont mean thoughtprovoking i mean might get people killed

i am satisfied and sufficiently occupied with the things which are without tormenting or troubling myself about those which may indeed be but of which i have no evidence

in every age it has been the tyrant the oppressor and the exploiter who has wrapped himself in the cloak of patriotism or religion or both to deceive and overawe the people

those who would renegotiate the boundaries between church and state must therefore answer a difficult question why would we trade a system that has served us so well for one that has served others so poorly

the maker of the universe with stars a hundred thousand lightyears apart was interested furious and very personal about it if a small boy played baseball on sunday afternoon

the best way to drive out the devil if he will not yield to texts of scripture is to jeer and flout him for he cannot bear scorn

like most modern people i dont believe in prophecy or magic and then spend half my time practicing it

humans are strange … they value punishment because they think it means their actions are important—that they are important … its vanity

fear is to begin with the end in mind there is no end life is eternal live life knowing that the end was your past and the future is only full of beautiful beginnings through an eternity built around god’s love

the only interesting thing about religion is how many people its slaughtered communism and nazism are religions as well make no mistake about it

the liberty of man is not safe in the hands of any church wherever the bible and sword are in partnership man is a slave

science fiction any scientific acclaim that omits god

the morning after the  attackswe began talking about the twin towers attack ruud shook his head sadly about it all he said its so weird isnt it all these people saying this has to do with islam

i couldnt help myselfi blurted out but it is about islam this is based in belief this is islam

god is peace bliss beauty and truth focus your energy on that life will be like that

ill stop eating steak when you stop killing spiders absurdity comparing cows to spiders arachnids are pure evil theyre like a cigarette manufacturer or a terrorist theyre organized religion on eight legs

spirituality is not adopting more beliefs and assumptions but uncovering the best in you

in monasteries seminaries retreats and synagogues they fear hell and seek paradise those who know the mysteries of god never let that seed be planted in their souls

groups create supernatural beings not to explain the universe but to order their societies

grant me o lord my god a mind to know you a heart to seek you wisdom to find you conduct pleasing to you faithful perseverance in waiting for you and a hope of finally embracing you amen

everyone must come out of his exile in his own way

religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich

concerned but not consumed

the essence of science is that it is always willing to abandon a given idea for a better one the essence of theology is that it holds its truths to be eternal and immutable

the bible is the greatest of all books to study it is the noblest of all pursuits to understand it the highest of all goals

the world is charged with the grandeur of god

all religions are based on obsolete terminology

the mahabharata is not a work of religious instruction

it is much greater it is a work of art

it understands men will always fall in the shifting chasm between the tug of the moral and the lure of the immoral

it is in this shifting space of uncertitude that men become men

not animals not gods

it understands truth is relative that it is defined by context and motive it encourages the noblest of men  yudhishtra arjuna lord krishna himself  to lie so that a greater truth may be served

it understands the world is powered by desire and that desire is an unknowable thing desire conjures death destruction distress

but also creates love beauty art it is our greatest undoing and the only reason for all doing

and doing is life doing is karma

you must know the world before you are done with it you must act on desire before you renounce it there can be no merit in forgoing the not known

the greatest book in the world rescues volition from religion and gives it back to man

religion is the disciplinarian fantasy of a schoolmaster

the mahabharata is the joyous song of life of a maestro

in its tales within tales it takes religion for a spin and skins it inside out leaves it puzzling over its own poisoned follicles

it gives men the chance to be splendid doubtridden architects of some small part of their lives duryodhanas who can win even as they lose

faith in god is an opening up a letting go a deep trust a free act of love  but sometimes it was so hard to love

there was a time when people accepted magical experiences as natural there were no priests then and no one went chasing after the secrets of the occult

not a believer in the mosque am i

nor a disbeliever with his rites am i

i am not the pure amongst the impure

i am neither moses nor pharaoh

bulleh i know not who i am

not in the holy books am i

nor do i dwell in bhang or wine

nor do i live in a drunken haze

nor in sleep or waking known

bulleh i know not who i am

not in happiness or in sorrow am i found

i am neither pure nor mired in filthy ground

not of water nor of land

nor am i in air or fire to be found

bulleh i know not who i am

not an arab nor lahori

not a hindi or nagouri

nor a muslim or peshawari

not a buddhist or a christian

bulleh i know not who i am

secrets of religion have i not unravelled

i am not of eve and adam

neither still nor moving on

i have not chosen my own name

bulleh i know not who i am

from first to last i searched myself

none other did i succeed in knowing

not some great thinker am i

who is standing in my shoes alone

bulleh i know not who i am

the body is wiser than its inhabitants the body is the soul the body is god’s messenger

i believe that life should be lived so vividly and so intensely that thoughts of another life or of a longer life are not necessary

since the beginning of time spirituality and religion have been called to fill in the gaps that science did not understand

the laws of physics is the canvas god laid down on which to paint his masterpiece

god is not interested in your art but your heart

jehovahs witness are welcomed into my homeyou gotta respect anybody who gets all dressed up in sunday clothes and goes doortodoor on days so hot their high heels sink a halfinch into the pavement

the trick is to do all the talking yourself pretty soon theyll look at their watches and say speaking of end times wouldja look at what time it is now

far from seeking to

justify as does the church the necessity of torments and

afflictions he cried in his outraged pity if a god has made this

world i should not wish to be that god the worlds wretchedness

would rend my heart

i have always considered myself a person with a gypsy heart and i

surrender my dreams to my soul for its a free sprit who believes in no boundaries of region and religion

he was a wise man who invented god

children know by instinct that hell is an absence of love and they can pick out theirs without missing

do those people who hold up the bible as an inspiration to

moral rectitude have the slightest notion of what is actually written

in it

an honest religious thinker is like a tightrope walker he almost looks as though he were walking on nothing but air his support is the slenderest imaginable and yet it really is possible to walk on it

you could just as well say that an agnostic is a deeply religious person with at least a rudimentary knowledge of human fallibility

im probably  percent atheist and  percent agnostic i dont think anyone really knows youll either find out or not when you get there until then theres no point thinking about it

to regret religion is to regret western civilization

listen to the secret sound the real sound which is inside you the one no one talks of speaks the secret sound to himself and he is the one who has made it all

only a very few can be learned but all can be christian all can be devout and – i shall boldly add – all can be theologians

i think it religion is an art the greatest one an extension of the communion all the other arts attempt

i always tell my western friends that it is best to keep your own tradition changing religion is not easy and sometimes causes confusion you must value your tradition and honor your own religion

anything beyond the limits and grasp of the human mind is either illusion or futility and because your god having to be one or the other of the two in the first instance i should be mad to believe in him and in the second a fool

omnipotentbenevolent simply means that god is allpowerful and wellmeaning

i understand the concept its just    there seems to be a contradiction

yes the contradiction is pain mans starvation war sickness

the camerlengo frowned would he

do you have children lieutenant

chartrand flushed no signore

imagine you had an eightyearold son    would you love him

would you let him skateboard

chartrand did a double take the camerlengo always seemed oddly in touch for a clergyman yeah i guess chartrand said sure id let him skateboard but id tell him to be careful

so as this childs father you would give him some basic good advice and then let him go off and make his own mistakes

i wouldnt run behind him and mollycoddle him if thats what you mean

but what if he fell and skinned his knee

he would learn to be more careful

the camerlengo smiled so although you have the power to interfere and prevent your childs pain you would choose to show your love by letting him learn his own lessons

of course pain is part of growing up its how we learn

the camerlengo nodded exactly

it is interesting to find that people of faith now seek defensively to say that they are no worse than fascists or nazis or stalinists

its time we capture our imaginations for christ

religion is more than rite and ritual

define the word exist and youll know whether god exists

i dont think it is a good mental health practice to fantasize that you know the infinite thoughts of imaginary entities

ive always privately suspected that jesus is in favor of revolutionaries seeing as how he was a bit of one himself

no philosophy no religion has ever brought so glad a message to the world as this good news of atheism

question with boldness even the existence of a god because if there be one he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear

i hate organized religion i hate that people use it to justify their crappy bigoted beliefs

it is easier to change a mans religion than to change his diet

they are trying to make me into a fixed star i am an irregular planet

we have to believe in freewill weve got no choice

to know much and taste nothingof what use is that

all the tales of miracles with which the old and new testament are filled are fit only for impostors to preach and fools to believe

untilled ground however rich will bring forth thistles and thorns so also the mind of man

with the moon walk the religious myth that sustained these notions could no longer be held with our view of earthrise we could see that the earth and the heavens were no longer divided but that the earth is in the heavens

i went to the garden of love

and saw what i never had seen

a chapel was built in the midst

where i used to play on the green

and the gates of this chapel were shut

and thou shalt not writ over the door

so i turnd to the garden of love

that so many sweet flowers bore

and i saw it was filled with graves

and tombstones where flowers should be

and priests in black gowns were walking their rounds

and binding with briars my joys  desires

the garden of love

the danger today is in believing there are no sick people there is only a sick society

sex is like an atom bomb a potent weapon which fascinates and frightens were afraid to let it loose yet we all have our finger on the button

the more profoundly we study this wonderful book the bible and the more closely we observe its divine precept the better citizens we will become and the higher will be our destiny as a nation

god come down if youre really there

well youre the one who claims to care

the very ritual practices that the new atheists dismiss as costly inefficient and irrational turn out to be a solution to one of the hardest problems humans face cooperation without kinship

far better it is for you to say i am a sinner than to say i have no need of religion the empty can be filled but the selfintoxicated have no room for god

never doubt god in the darkness what he has given us in the light

i didn’t want any flowers i only wanted

to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty

how free it is you have no idea how free——

the peacefulness is so big it dazes you

and it asks nothing a name tag a few trinkets

it is what the dead close on finally i imagine them

shutting their mouths on it like a communion tablet

a religious man is a person who holds god and man in one thought at one time at all times who suffers harm done to others whose greatest passion is compassion whose greatest strength is love and defiance of despair

every natural love will rise again and live forever in this country but none will rise again until it has been buried

we ignorant of ourselves

beg often our own harms which the wise powers

deny us for our good so find we profit

by losing of our prayers

to learn a belief without the belief is to sing a song without the tune

you cannot exalt god and yourself at the same time

it seems to me that no matter what religion you subscribe to acts of kindness are the steppingstones to making the world a better placebecause we become better people in it

any civilization where the main symbol of religious veneration is a tool of execution is a bad place to have children

mythology may in a real sense be defined as other peoples religion and religion may in a sense be understood as popular misunderstanding of mythology

weariness that wants to reach the ultimate with one leap with one fatal leap a poor ignorant weariness that does not want to want any more this created all gods and afterworlds

christ died for our sins dare we make his martyrdom meaningless by not committing them

he die one day and then he go above of my head to live with your father

he weared the long hair and after he died the first day he come back here for to say hello to the peoples

he nice the jesus

christianity is a religion in a rush

one thing about great art it made you love people more forgive them their petty transgressions it worked in the way that religion was supposed to if you thought about it

receive this blessing as you go forth this day may the lord bless you and keep you may the lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you may the lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace numbers

life is but a momentary glimpse of the wonder of this astonishing universe and it is sad to see so many dreaming it away on spiritual fantasy

i may grow rich by an art i am compelled to follow i may recover health by medicines i am compelled to take against my own judgment but i cannot be saved by a worship i disbelieve and abhor

a philosopher is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isnt there a theologian is the man who finds it

no one can do everything but everyone can do something

salvation is for the feeble thats what i think i dont want salvation i want life all of life the miserable as well as the superb

common sense is no match for the voice of god

if people but knew their own religion how tolerant they would become and how free from any grudge against the religion of others

allah is the greatest im just the greatest boxer

that which is impenetrable to us really exists behind the secrets of nature remains something subtle intangible and inexplicable veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion

amendment to live by

joy

yourself last

were starting our own religion at last the order of frisbeetarians we believe that when you die your soul ascends to a rooftop and you can never get it back

religion is for man and not man for religion

humans they lived in a world where the grass continued to be green and the sun rose every day and flowers regularly turned into fruit and what impressed them weeping statues and wine made out of water

catholic versus protestant essentially its that kind of fight  and it goes on to this day will we never learn who knows religion shit it

peace sweet peace finally comes to men when they humbly yield to the gentle pressure of the spirit

persecution is not an original feature in any religion but it is always the strongly marked feature of all religions established by law

i have always thought that if womens hair posed so many problems god would certainly have made us bald

you have told me o god to believe in hell but you have forbidden me to thinkof any man as damned

my lack of faith in god is not a dilapidated house

it does not need to be razed to the ground or burned down to cinders

i refuse to be the wounded woman on a cross

that you crucify with your disapproval like nails

i will only be the woman who believes in thunderstorms

the same way lightning loves the tops of trees it strikes

every time it gets tired of being pent up in an unforgiving sky

the only difference is that i believe these are natural weather phenomenons

not god’s belly rumbling or synapses firing

when my doorway is filled with groups of people

i will be the martyr who steps aside to let the arrows

crack through the plaster in my wall instead of piercing my chest

this is not a eulogy to the believer i could have been

this is a battle cry to the believer i always have been

after old nights spent drowning in despair believer

in love as an entire language instead of a single word

just because my beliefs align themselves on a different spectrum

does not mean they are the wrong wavelength or color

and even though i think the universe was created by the big bang

instead of a god with magic dust shooting from his fingertips

my universe does not contain fewer stars

christians they’re determined to rid the land of any who worship the horned one murdering all the druids burning the temples sometimes whole villages and knocking over the standing stones

the lady’s face hardened this god of peace and love certainly likes to bathe the land in blood

wesin not because we want what is evil but because we want what isnt good enough

ive never had much use for religion except when it comes to swearing or begging for mercy

the world viewed philosophically remains a series of slave camps where citizens – tax livestock – labor under the chains of illusion in the service of their masters

we should never wait for science to give us permission to do the uncommon if we do then we are turning science into another religion

now he haunts me seldom some fierce umbilical is broken

i live with my own fragile hopes and sudden rising despair

now i do not weep for my sins i have learned to love them

and to know that they are the wounds that make love real

his face illudes me his voice with its pity does not ring in my ear

his maxims memorized in boyhood do not make fruitless and pointless my experience

i walk alone but not so terrified as when he held my hand

i do not splash in the blood of his son

nor hear the crunch of nails or thorns piercing protesting flesh

i am a boy againi whose boyhood was turned to manhood in a brutal myth

now wine is only wine with drops that do not taste of blood

the bread i eat has too much pride for transubstantiation

i tooand together the bread and i embrace

each grateful to be what we are each loving from our own reality

to me religion is about our dignity not our depravity

on this understanding ethics consists less of rules to be obeyed than of principles for inner selfregulation to promote those aspects of our nature which we recognize as conducive to our own wellbeing and that of others

it is by moving beyond narrow selfinterest that we find meaning purpose and satisfaction in life

he divorced the mother of his children which caused mileva his wife to have a break down and be hospitalized

he was a ladies man and was known to have had several affairs infidelity was listed as a reason for his divorce

he married his cousin

he had an estranged relationship with his son

he had his first child out of wedlock

he urged the fdr to build the atom bomb which killed thousands of people

we need to eliminate the concept of division by class skills race income religion and nationality every human requires food and water to survive and every human has a heart that bleeds loves and grieves

an eternity of wishing to speak directly to my creator  i thought in despair  and this is how he finally contacts me through aol instant messenger

we are not worshipping anyone or anything we are simply communing with creation

sin will take you where you didnt plan to go it will keep you there longer than you planned to stay and it will cost you more than you intended to pay

vampires like virgins or priests are things that women believe in we must never fail to humor them in such matters

you know how it goes

at some point in your life

you fell in love with someone

and had a glimpse of god

then you abandoned life and lover

and started celebrating

your love for god

catholics get on well with tyranny its in the culture

religious people of any serious kind made her nervous they were like men in raincoats who might or might not be flashers

when the aggregates arise decay and die o bhikkhu every moment you are born decay and die

when i was in my single digits i was subjected to the worst torture you can possibly inflict on a child catholic mass

your religious beliefs are your business they are not and should not be the basis for law if you use them as justification to discriminate against others don’t be upset when others decide you’re an asshole

knowledge absolutely sure of its infallibility is faith

be careful what you wish for you never know who will be listening

what each of us believes in is up to us but life is impossible without believing in something

what is seen is not the truth

what is cannot be said

trust comes not without seeing

nor understanding without words

the wise comprehends with knowledge

to the ignorant it is but a wonder

some worship the formless god

some worship his various forms

in what way he is beyond these attributes

only the knower knows

that music cannot be written

how can then be the notes

say kabir awareness alone will overcome illusion

in all times and all countries especially in those countries which are divided within by religious faith there are always fanatics who will be well contented to be regarded as martyrs

i know one thing you dont i know the difference between right and wrong they didnt teach you that at school

rose didnt answer the woman was quite right the two words meant nothing to her their taste was extinguished by stronger foodsgood and evil

you must promise me you cant desire the end without desiring the means

ah but one can he thought one can one can desire the peace of victory without desiring the ravaged towns

they could not understand the advantage of living contrary to their inclinations in this world in order to enjoy a hypothetical wellbeing in another

i dont think its possible to ccall yourself a cchristian and and jjust leave out the awkward bits wilfred owen

you can never talk religion on network tv it makes too many people angry you can talk about sex

the believer in magic and miracles reflects on how to impose a law on nature and in brief the religious cult is the outcome of this reflection

religion is no longer the opium of the people but the vitamin pills of the feeble

same thing with water towers and god i dont have to be a believer to be serious about my religion

i used to think that kid might become a preacher now i dont see how hes going to stay out of prison nobody in this family ever went to prison for sex crimes hed be the first

yes says jesus you never know about these things

he and grandpa are drinking cups of coffee and eating ginger snaps grandpa says when are you planning to return to earth

soon as i finish this coffee say jesus pretty good isnt it

in moments of prayer people tend to pose as a critic and point out percieved flaws in gods art

muslims are the first victims of islam  to liberate the muslim from his religion is the best service that one can render him

whoever has my commandments and keeps them loves me and he who loves me will be loved by my father and i will love him and show myself to him

never trust the translation or interpretation of something without first trusting its interpreter

the worst moment for the atheist is when he is really thankful and has nobody to thank

coincidence is gods way of being anonymous

the faith of religion is belief on insufficient evidence

it is only through us that god lives when we abandon him he dies

churches thrive on martyrdom and persecution

patriotism is a kind of religion it is the egg from which wars are hatched

my uncle sosthenes

both porn and religion distort a person’s perspectives on women

sitting still is a pain in the ass

this is one reason people need to believe in god—because we want someone to know us truly all the way through even the worst of us

theres no god higher than truth

what is the world what is it for

assess it like that and when youre done find an ant and have him assess the cathedrals of europe

no religion except ours has taught that man is born in sin none of the philosophical sects has admitted it none therefore has spoken the truth

and priests in black gowns were walking their rounds

and binding with briars my joys  desires

being lost is the way how else can you be found

religious man was born to be saved psychological man is born to be pleased

in a wellfunctioning democracy the state constitution is considered more important than gods holy book whichever holy book that may be and god matters only in your private life

how do you know its not true if you dont believe in it

dogs are gonna take over the world its a known fact for those who believe it kinda like the bible

i need christ not something that resembles him

if i convert its because its better that a believer dies than that an atheist does

religion is never more tested than when our emotions are ablaze at such a time the timeless grandeur of the law and its ethics stand at our mercy

he prays because he knows he doesnt control it hes at the mercy of it

o allah if i worship you for fear of hell burn me in hell and if i worship you in hope of paradise exclude me from paradise but if i worship you for your own sake grudge me not your everlasting beauty

if the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky that would be like the splendor of the mighty one i am become death the shatterer of worlds

my religion is to live  and die  without regret

if i were to construct a god i would furnish him with some way and qualities and characteristics which the present lacks

do you think there is heaven or hell he signed

‘i don’t know not in the christian way if that’s what you mean i think people have a right to believe in whatever they want i just don’t’…

if someone came in here and gave you positive proof would you do anything different

he has done things that caused me to doubt his wisdom but never his existence

the statement ‘there is nothing more american than an indian’ happens to be a multidimensional paradox try and not say too many of those that might open your mind to ideas that could cause sanity point loss

it amazes me when education religion and family values fail to create a human being

at this time of year its easy to forget the true meaning of christianity  the lies the corruption the abuse

are there any religions on your list that include the slaughter of noblemen as a holy duty

go back to sleep

yes you are allowed

you who have no love in your heart

you can go back to sleep

the power of love

is exclusive to us

you can go back to sleep

i have been burnt

by the fire of love

you who have no such yearning in your heart

go back to sleep

the path of love

has seventytwo folds and countless facets

your love and religion

is all about deceit control and hypocrisy

go back to sleep

i have torn to pieces my robe of speech

and have let go of the desire to converse

you who are not naked yet

you can go back to sleep

when you can flatten entire cities at a whim a tendency towards quiet reflection and seeingthingsfromtheotherfellowspoint ofview is seldom necessary

there is no limit to the amount of intelligence invested in ignorance when the need for illusion runs deep

beware the religion that turns you against another one its unlikely that its really religion at all

you dont have to stop thinking and asking questions to believe in god child if hed wanted a flock of eight billion sheep he wouldnt have given us opposable thumbs much less free will

two or three angels

came near to the earth

they saw a fat church

came and went in continually

and the angels were puzzled

to know why the people went thus

and why they stayed so long within

your daily life is your temple and your religion

when you enter into it take with you your all

religions die when they are proved to be true science is the record of dead religions

you will be at your best forever even now you have good moments occasional glimpses of your heavenly self when you change your babys diaper forgive your bosss temper tolerate your spouses moodiness you display traces of saintliness

we rely on faith only in the context of claims for which there is no sufficient sensory or logical evidence

unfortunately this electric monk had developed a fault and had started to believe all kinds of things more or less at random it was even beginning to believe things theyd have difficulty believing in salt lake city

it is in your hands to make life miserable or happy no religion spiritual leaders or knowledge will ever make you fully satisfied

we are enjoined to love our neighbor not our tribe

the basic idea underlying religion is to create an atmosphere for the spiritual development of the individual

can a mortal ask questions which god finds unanswerable quite easily i should think all nonsense questions are unanswerable

if christ taught us anything it is this  not to let our fear of death keep us from doing the good thing

they religions dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of daylight and scowl on the fatal harbinger announcing the subversions of the duperies on which they live

for love is a celestial harmony

of likely hearts composd of stars concent

which join together in sweet sympathy

to work each others joy and true content

which they have harbourd since their first descent

out of their heavenly bowers where they did see

and know each other here belovd to be

the hindus criticise the mahomedans for having spread their religion by the use of the sword they also ridicule christianity on the score of the inquisition

i have no hesitation in saying that if the mahomedan has been cruel the hindu has been mean and meanness is worse than cruelty

born under one law to another bound

vainly begot and yet forbidden vanity

created sick commanded to be sound

liberty a word without which all other words are vain

creators arent gods they make places which is quite hard its men that make gods this explains a lot

a working knowledge of the devil can be very well had from resisting him

‘what a coldblooded jest’ said he to himself ‘it was not devised by a god’

from that time forth he renounced a better world and never uncovered himself when a name was pronounced and for him the carven saints in the churches became works of art

spiritual pain is when you can’t stand another moment not knowing the real truth and when you finally do know you can’t let go

very well lets consider the objection i doubt that the defender of religion will find it attractive once we explore it carefully

its your serve

i wont put my ignorance on an altar and call it god it feels like idolatry like the worst kind of idolatry

there was a time when skepticism was an act of rebellion since to a degree i both believe in evolution and have faith i can only conclude that as prophesied to have faith will someday be an act of rebellion

he believed in god even if he was doubtful of mens claims to know gods mind but that a god unable to forgive was no god at all

empty words and long praises do not impress god show him your faith by your deeds

no religion is higher than humanity

it does me no injury for my neighbour to say there are  gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg

that’s the biggest purpose of religious gathering permission to look terrible in public we used to go to church to confess our worst behaviour to be heard and forgiven then to be redeemed and accepted back into our community

chuck palahniuk in interview with tmo

the divine voice is not always expressed in words it is made known as a heartconsciousness

religion can only do two things for mankind turn them into monster or stupid

it is an absurdity to believe that the deity has human passions and one of the lowest of human passions a restless appetite for applause

worshiping the devil is no more insane than worshiping godit is precisely at the moment when positivism is at its highwater mark that mysticism stirs into life and the follies of occultism begin

think of god and not religion of ecstasy and not mysticism the difference between the theoretician of faith and the believer is as great as between the psychiatrist and the psychotic

we can either emphasize those aspects of our traditions religious or secular that speak of hatred exclusion and suspicion or work with those that stress the interdependence and equality of all human beings the choice is yours

it is straightforward—and never mind for now about plagues and famines if god existed and if he cared for humankind he would never have given us religion

when the stakes are this high when calling god by the right name can make the difference between eternal happiness and eternal suffering it is impossible to respect the beliefs of others who dont believe as you do

the only thing that guarantees an openended collaboration among human beings the only thing that guarantees that this project is truly openended is a willingness to have our beliefs and behaviors modified by the power of conversation

i’m sure i am wrong about many things although i’m not sure exactly which things i’m wrong about i’m even sure i’m wrong about what i think i’m right about in at least some cases

the natural is so awesome that we need not go beyond it

god has judged me all my life but that is gods privilege my lady not yours

real life seeks the gentle slopes at the back of mount improbable while creationists are blind to all but the daunting precipice at the front

the gods of the realms are many and varied  or they are the many and varied names and identities tagged onto the same being i know not  and care not  which

religion isnt the opium of the people its the hypocrisy

a soft and sheltered christianity afraid to be lean and lone unwilling to face the storms and brave the heights will end up fat and foul in the cages of conformity

and fragile is thy tenure of this world

still haunted by the monstrous ghost of god

to science

as a man casting off worn out garments taketh new ones so the dweller in the body entereth into ones that are new

i dont belive in god i believe inal pacino

the purpose of the gospel is to make bad men good and good men better and to change human nature

faith requires following the power of a whisper

love and religion thought clarissa going back into the drawing room tingling all over how detestable how detestable they are

have you ever thought what a god would be like who actually ordained and executed the cruelty that is in the biblical book of revelation a holocaust of mankind yet so many of these biblemen accept the idea without a second thought

if my god damns people for love but saves them for brutle warfare then that is not the god i know or wish to worship

a sect or party is an elegant incognito devised to save a man from the vexation of thinking

the people who burned witches at the stake never for one moment thought of their act as violence rather they thought of it as an act of divinely mandated righteousness the same can be said of most of the violence humans have ever committed

i believe that people who are devoutly religious within any specific religion have no true respect for the ultimate vastness that is god

the small god in ch

i had failed to make a gift of myself to god

for this reason i tell you when you pray and ask for something believe that you have received it and you will be given whatever you ask for

it is possible i can make very little of myself but this little is everything and better than what i allow to be made out of me by the might of others by the training of custom religion the laws the state

treaty with tripoli art  as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion

be courageous and he shall strengthen your heart all of you who hope in the lord

a fundamentalist is someone who wants to substitute what he believes for what you believe max said and someone who thinks he knows the will of god better than anyone else

when confronted by a ‘believer’ it is easy for me to contrast the views of the skeptic with those of the rationalist i simply reach into my pocket and pull out my change

holding a quarter aloft i say ‘this is a most remarkable coin for it is heavier than all the sins of humanity committed since the beginning of the human race’

i then hold up a nickel and say ‘this coin is even more amazing as it is brighter and shinier than the flames that proceeded from the burning bush discovered on mt sinai by moses’

then i raise a penny and state ‘this portrait of president lincoln is more realistic and truetolife than any portrait of satan ever painted’

and finally i hold out a bright shiny dime and say ‘and this dime is the most amazing of all because it is heavier and contains more precious metals than all the gold bricks in the streets of heaven’

i end with ‘give to caesar what is his and hold the rest of it dear—for it is all you see and touch—and the christian god can take care of all his things for they amount to less than this  cents i hold here in my hand

could it be as one writer puts it that every knock at the door of a brothel is actually a knock at the heart of god

the problem i have with all this religion stuff is that i cant relate to it i think most people got into cos it gave them something to do on a sunday but since all the shops are now open it isnt required as much

i think the attempt to defend belief can unsettle it in fact because there is always an inadequacy in argument about ultimate things

conflict is inevitable but combat is optional

with or without god good decisions can be made but only with god will great decisions be made

it is difficult to imagine a set of beliefs more suggestive of mental illness than those that lie at the heart of many of our religious traditions

rule number two monsignor do not show pity

theology is the effort to explain the﻿ unknowable in terms of the not worth knowing

i dont see i said how people stand being old your insides all dry up when youre young youre so selfreliant you dont even need much religion

since living is believing no one can be completely lacking in faith

not bad not bad at all diotallevi said to arrive at the truth through the painstaking reconstruction of a false text

the healing is my working out my salvation the need constant because my desire for seperateness constantly wrestles with my need for oneness with jesus the search for jesus is bigger deeper and agonizing

leaving your religion and having to invent your own system of values is a big deal after all

i thought this was a perfect illustration of the caprice and cruelty of absolute leadership and began to phrase a little pun about kim jong il being the oh dear leader but it died on my lips

the art of life is to live in the present moment and to make that moment as perfect as we can by the realization that we are the instruments and expression of god himself

do you believe in god doctor

no  but what does that really mean im fumbling in the dark struggling to make something out but ive long ceased finding that original

religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves i am not the kind of person i want to be it must never sink into an assemblage of the selfsatisfied

whose little boy are you

whoever possesses god in their being has him in a divine manner and he shines out to them in all things for them all things taste of god and in all things it is gods image that they see

if i could sister james i would certainly choose to live in innocence but innocence can only be wisdom in a world without evil situations arise and we are confronted with wrongdoing and the need to act

i shall drink to the pope if you please still to conscience first and to the pope afterwards

i had retained little of what is generally called religion except for a visceral conviction that our lives are controlled by some universal mechanism that is greater than ourselves perhaps that was what others called god perhaps not

the only thing that is still free in this world is religion which is why a lot of people find it

as every inquiry which regards religion is of the utmost importance there are two questions in particular which challenge our attention to wit that concerning its foundation in reason and that concerning it origin in human nature

please do not ever think i am without you or you are without me i live with you all the time

the church of england is the only church in the world that interferes neither with your politics nor your religion

i am very close to him sometimes i think i am him with my mood is the weatherbright and sunny forever

dont go taking that gospel stuff seriously its nice to clean you out now and then but it aint for real its like bad whiskey run through you fast and leave you with pain

religion turned some folks belligerent

i figured anybody who talked about church as much as she did was using it a little like cocaine anyhow

but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me

you can believe in whatsoever you like but the truth remains the truth no matter how sweet the lie may taste

i’m an atheist and a militant atheist when religion starts impacting on legislation

all men are prophets or else god does not exist

the language of light can only be decoded by the heart

mist to mist drops to drops for water thou art and unto water shalt thou return

this country is like a college chick after two long island iced teas we can be talked into anything like wars and we can be talked out of anything like health care we should forget the town halls and replace them with study halls

i rest my case

christ did not die to save people but to teach people how to save each other this is i have no doubt a grave heresy but it is also a fact

if atheism is a religion then health is a disease

those who have loved are those that have found god

there is only one language the language of the heart there is only one religion the religion of love

i felt an overwhelming gratitude in my life right now and wanted a chance to acknowledge it i felt that any thanks given to any god all went to the same place anyway no matter what religion you were centered in

come judgment day we may find that mumbo jumbo the god of the congo was the big boss all along

all christian language about the future is a set of signposts pointing into a mist

dont they get afraid then

they have a religion for that

one entry was entitled about god

yes there is one god and he lives in the sky and he hears all of us it is just that here on earth we are confused about how to believe in him but what does it matter as long as we trust he is there

all religions have something to say about sex and it rarely coincides with scientific knowledge of sex and sexuality

any faith that admires truth that strives to know god must be brave enough to accommodate the universe

but its well known that repression makes a religion flourish

why are those who are notoriously undisciplined and unmoral also most contemptuous of religion and morality they are trying to solace their own unhappy lives by pulling the happy down to their own abysmal depths

i maintain that the cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific research

when the stars threw down their spears

and watered heaven with their tears

did he smile his work to see

did he who made the lamb make thee

the tyger

verily knowledge is a lock and its key is the question

immortal amarant a flower which once

in paradise fast by the tree of life

began to bloom but soon for mans offence

to heaven removed where first it grew there grows

and flowers aloft shading the fount of life

and where the river of bliss through midst of heaven

with these that never fade the spirits elect

bind their resplendent locks

faith is a luxury for those who are able to ignore what the rest of us must see every day pessimism distrust and irony are the holy trinity of my religion irony in particular

faith does not offer a strong link between our beliefs and actual states of the world

i really tried or so i thought to avoid lying but it seemed to me that they forced it on me by the difference in their vision of things so that i was always transposing reality for them into something they could understand

the most important lesson that were supposed to be learning right now is how completely lost we are without god if we dont learn this lesson then our lives are going to have zero meaning stronger forty days of metal and spirituality

perhaps the creator of this strange place knows us better than we know ourselves perhaps humanity was meant to eternally ponder the purpose and importance of our own existence if we were assured of either we’d be intolerable creatures

but you must still know to respect other peoples faith

why we dont respect any other delusion we lock up people who believe theyre christ yet were supposed to humour those who believe in him

by definition faith is irrational a belief you hold against the normal rules of evidence

in which case i believe in jedi

in  pope pius xi of all people sent some vatican delegates on a trip to libya with these written instructions do not think that you are going among infidels muslims attain salvation too the ways of providence are infinite

we give up our backs and allow religious myths to apply the rear naked choke to our minds

all governments suffer a recurring problem power attracts pathological personalities it is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible

webelieve that art is religious because it is one of mans highest aspirations there is no such thing as pagan art only good and bad art

but when he has done this let him not say that he knows better than his master for he only holds a candle in sunshine

provided that any of those neighbours sing out of tune or have boots that squeak or double chins or odd clothes the patient will quite easily believe that their religion must therefore be somehow ridiculous

mormons invented themselves just as other religious and ethnic groups invented themselves but mormons did so in such a singularly impressive way that we will probably always remain baffled as to how exactly it happened

one who practices pure religion soon discovers it is more rewarding to lift a man up than to hold him down

i would have stolen it for you had i known you were interested his voice was muffled by the door to the lumber room down the hallway and i heard thumps and a crash

i raised my voice a trifle more than mere volume required im interested because she was both of them come to thatdamians art is infused with mystic symbols and traditions

holmes voice answered two inches away from my ear making me jerk and spray a handful of maps across the floor religion can be a dangerous thing it is true he remarked darkly and went out again

concerning that which cannot be talked about we should not say anything

some people believe the alternative to bad religion is secularism but thats wrong     the answer to bad religion is better religionprophetic rather than partisan broad and deep instead of narrow and based on values as opposed to ideology

if christ were born in bethlehem a thousand times and not in thee thyself then art thou lost eternally

i think one of the things you and i have to learn is that we have to live without the consolation of belonging to a church

of one thing i am certain the religion of the future will have to be extremely ascetic and by that i dont mean just going without food and drink

one night i dreamed i was walking along the beach with the lord many scenes from my life flashed across the sky

in each scene i noticed footprints in the sand sometimes there were two sets of footprints other times there was one only

this bothered me because i noticed that during the low periods of my life when i was suffering from anguish sorrow or defeat i could see only one set of footprints so i said to the lord

you promised me lord

that if i followed you you would walk with me always but i have noticed that during the most trying periods of my life there has only been one set of footprints in the sand why when i needed you most have you not been there for me

the lord replied the years when you have seen only one set of footprints my child is when i carried you

youve been brought up like a gentleman and a christian and i should be false to the trust laid upon me by your dead father and mother if i allowed you to expose yourself to such temptation

well i know im not a christian and im beginning to doubt whether im a gentleman said philip

you are not insane if you believe in things that dont exist you are insane if you are the only one believing in it this is the difference between religion and insanity

i dont know and probably never will know enough about the true nature of the universe to tell anyone else what to believe and ive come to distrust the words of those who have presumed to do so

scientific people unscientific mind why are we dividing the world which could shine between religion and science all what matters is human lives

so many years later there were many who still complained and questioned ‘why must you pick up christians and hindus in your ambulance’ and i was saying ‘because the ambulance is more muslim than you’

the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed

technos and clerics have much in common both take a world that can’t be fully understood and try to explain its fundamental properties

technos work from the bottom up they build a baseline of observations and formulate theories to explain these phenomena nothing is sacred with new observations theories are discarded or modified to fit the facts

technos and clerics how could they not be in conflict

human desire is the criterion of all truth and all good truth does not lie beyond humanity but is one of the products of the human mind and feeling there is really nothing to fear the motive of fear in religion is base

three things cannot be retrieved

the arrow once sped from the bow

the word spoken in haste

the missed opportunity

ali the lion caliph of islam soninlaw of mohammed the prophet

i dont trust catholics i said because they take advantage of you

and protestants he asked with a laugh

i loathe the way they fumble around with their consciences

and atheists he was still laughing

they bore me because all they ever talk about is god

michael had once read to her how god had cast a man and woman out of paradise yet for all their human faults and failures god had shown them the way back in

the cold within

in dark and bitter cold

each one possessed a stick of wood

or so the storys told

the first woman held hers back

for of the faces around the fire

she noticed one was black

saw not one of his church

and couldnt bring himself to give

the fire his stick of birch

the third one sat in tattered clothes

he gave his coat a hitch

why should his log be put to use

to warm the idle rich

the rich man just sat back and thought

of the wealth he had in store

and how to keep what he had earned

from the lazy shiftless poor

the black mans face bespoke revenge

as the fire passed from sight

for all he saw in his stick of wood

was a chance to spite the white

the last man of this forlorn group

did naught except for gain

giving only to those who gave

was how he played the game

the logs held tight in deaths still hands

they didnt die from the cold without

they died from the cold within

i dont think god wants to be worshiped i think the only pure worship of god is by loving one another and i think all other forms of worship became a substitute for the love that we should show one another

god will bring people and events into our lives and whatever we may think about them they are designed for the evolution of his life in us

first the priests arrive then the conquistadores

religion grants its adherents malign intoxicating and morally corrosive sensations destroying intellectual freedom is always evil but only religion makes doing evil feel quite so good

every single human being should be the fulfilment of a prophecy for every human being should be the realisation of some ideal either in the mind of god or in the mind of man

you are one woman in an endless line of women who were chosen to love more passionately than others be committed to justice more fervently than others and seek our maker’s higher expressions more reflectively than others

ankhmorpork is a godless city

i thought it had more than three hundred places of worship said maladict

strappi stared at him in rage that was incoherent until he managed to touch bottom again ankhmorpork is a godawful city he recovered

i need no master to punish me in order to behave as i ought if i did i would be no more than a child who obeys his fathers rules only because he fears the whip and not because he actually means good

those who say religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion is

no egoism is so insufferable as the christian with regard to his soul

the rash assertion that god made man in his own image is ticking like a time bomb at the foundation of many faiths

i figure if there is a god shes good and surged right now about the state of things down here

religion is what an individual does with his solitariness

he wondered reflectively what would happen if you asked a nun where the gents was probably the pope sent you a sharp note or something

youve seen what youve seen youve felt what youve felt ideology is for people who dont trust their own experiences and perceptions of the world

a spirtually illumined soul lives in the world yet is never contaminated by it

charity is no substitute for justice withheld

fanatics are picturesque mankind would rather see gestures than listen to reasons

to be a philosophical sceptic is the first and most essential step towards being a sound believing christian

irreverence is a most necessary ingredient of religion not to speak of its importance in philosophy irreverence is the only way left to us for testing our universe

saying spirituality cannot exist without religion is like saying hamburgers cannot exist without mcdonalds

i dont believe in angels and i have trouble with the whole god thing i dont want to say i dont believe in god but i dont think i do but i believe in people who do

if you want allah to be persistent in granting you the thing you love then be persistent in doing the things he loves

to be frank i find religion rather offensive

yevgeny yevtushenko you atheist

kingsley amis well yes but its more that i hate him

to tell you the truth im something of an atheist

so jesus in the throes of his passion is an image of hope god is on the side of those who suffer

to become truly humanone has to try an release oneself from the shackles of racereligion and nationalitythe quantum of humanism one acquires is inevitably filtered when one limits oneselfashoka jahnavi prasadkant lecture

i wish all those whove found god would tell the rest of us where hes been hiding

learn from the past prepare for the future and perform in the moment moments making your life count for what matters most mike van hoozer

do you know what religion is martin my friend

i can barely remember lords prayer

on the black earth on which the ice plants bloomed hundreds of black stink bugs crawled and many of them stuck their tails up in the air look at all them stink bugs hazel remarked grateful to the bugs for being there

theyre interesting said doc

well what they got their asses up in the air for

hazel turned one of the stink bugs over with the toe of his wet tennis shoe and the shining black beetle strove madly with floundering legs to get upright again well why do you think they do it

i think theyre praying said doc

what hazel was shocked

lets get the hell out of here said hazel

above all we have to go beyond words and images and concepts no imaginative vision or conceptual framework is adequate to the great reality

let us keep in mind that we do not have to go to the scriptures inorder to approach god we do not have to find the right scripture inorder to talk to god

religion is different from everything else because in religion seeking is finding

i cant think why fancy religions should have such a ghastly effect on ones grammar its a kind of intellectual rot that sets in im afraid

i fled him down the nights and down the days

i fled him down the arches of the years

i fled him down the labyrinthine ways

of my own mind and in the midst of tears

i hid from him and under running laughter

when i was a child mama had the best voice of all the members of the church she had loved to sing her words had soared like an angels over the swells of the organ in fact i now suspected her entire theology had been taken from the hymnal

god is a book i can no longer read

all religions are beautiful in the story as you say its when theyre put into practice that they grow ugly

much theological discussion is wasted not because the words used have no possible meaning but because the people who use them dont mean anything by them

being rejected is not the end of your life its a means to an end for your life and that end is your destiny

in this walk to freedom we must without question obtain hearts of honesty and a tongue of truthfulness

if we reject science we reject the common man

frantic orthodoxy is never rooted in faith but in doubt it is when we are unsure that we are doubly sure

now faith is being sure of what we believe in and certain of what we do not see heb

it may be that until now there has been no more potent means for beautifying man himself than piety it can turn man into so much art surface play of colors graciousness that his sight no longer makes one suffer

so ministers say that they teach charity this is natural they live on alms all beggars teach that others should give

similarly money represents originally in accordance with the idea of money  private property for private property  society for private property  private property for society

but christ is alienated god and alienated man god has value only insofar as he represents christ and man has value only insofar as he represents christ it is the same with money

could a being create the fifty billion galaxies

each with two hundred billion stars

then rejoice in the smell of burning goat flesh

if you want to bring the world closer to peace be a peacemaker by creating peace whenever you can if you find yourself engaged in an argument that only stirs anger in the heart quickly make peace and carry on

the most wicked criminals have god on their lips at all times for god is the only one who can stomach them

remember if you dont sin then jesus died for nothing

once a buddha always a buddha sam dust off some of your old parables you have about fifteen minutes

sam held out his hand give me some tobacco and a paper

when you have faith in something a lot of other people believe then you a member of the church said ceas when you have faith in something nobody believes then you a complete wacko

science ask facts and religion ask faith humans are confused between life and death

the only religious opinion i feel sure of is this selfawareness is not just a bunch of amino acids bumping together

know thyself presume not god to scan

the proper study of mankind is man

your mercy is my social status

i hear and behold god in every object yet understand god not in the least

nor do i understand who there can be more wonderful than myself

i am afraid torvald i do not exactly know what religion is  when i am away from all this and am alone i will look into that matter too i will see if what the clergyman said is true or at all events if it is true for me

heaven the biggest waste of our time we ever invented outside jigsaws

we are all atheists about most of the gods that societies have ever believed in some of us just go one god further

that god is in truth the sort of bloodthirsty paranoid who would rend to bits fortytwo children for the crime of sassing one of his priests dont ask me about the front offices policies i just work here

whether we accept it or not this will likely be the century that determines what the optimal human population is for our planet it will come about in one of two ways

juanita believes that nothing is provably true or provably false in the bible because if its provably false then the bible is a lie and if its provably true then the existence of god is proven and theres no room for faith

education is fundamentally religious consequently there is no question about whether a morality will be imposed in that education but rather which morality will be imposed

many people require more than just evidence before they’ll accept evolution to these folks

god is perceived by the heart not by your reason but what is reason your heart simplifying god’s guidance to fit your own needs

i began to believe that god is us and nature beauty and love mystery and majesty everything right and good

so was the holocaust part of gods great plan is that why he allowed it to happen is that why god didnt answer the prayers of all those jews who begged him to make hitler drop dead

why didnt god just make hitler have a heart attack before he could start world war  why didnt he simply prevent hitler from being born how could a god who is supposed to be all good all the time allow something like the holocaust

sorry but there is no religion in the world that could sell me on believing that bullshit

what gave you this idea of an imperfect god

i dont know it seems quite feasible to me that is the only god i could imagine believing in a god whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purposea god who simply is

for when we cease to worship god we do not worship nothing we worship anything

if we are merely matter intricately assembled is this really demeaning if theres nothing here but atoms does that make us less or does that make matter more

i like how you call homosexuality an abomination

i dont say homosexualitys an abomination mr president the bible does

yes it does leviticus

ironic isnt it what religion does to people

i guess its more ironic what people do to religion

the westboro baptist church is no more a church than churchs fried chicken is a church

compassion is the religion of the heart

profound hearts wise minds take life as god makes it it is a long trial and unintelligible preparation for the unknown destiny

must you know that yours will be the better picture before you pick up the brush and paint can it not simply be another picture another expression of beauty

must a rose be better than an iris in order to justify it’s existence

i tell you this you are all flowers in the garden of the gods

ours is a terrible religion the fleets of the world could swim in spacious comfort in the innocent blood it has spilt

what the new mate sports car or unexpected check could never do christ says i can youll love how he achieves it he reconnects your soul with god

religion is a light bulb created by man to help him to see in the dark

whats the truth the truth is what people want liars are basically idealists liars are saints and prophets jesus was a liar

i just wish this social institution religion wasnt based on what appears to me to be a monumental hoax built on an accumulation of customs and myths directed toward proving something that isnt true

a man without reason is no better than a mad dog and mad dogs must be put down for the good of everyone

no single explanation will ever contain the final answer for all time for all hearers there is always always more to learn

let us at least say of religion that it means that every part of the body is infused with mind not that the mind is overwhelmed and drowned in body for the principal attribute of the gods without or within us is mind

heresy is another word for freedom of thought

ive always wondered how much can you do for your fellow man if your hands are constantly stuck together in prayers for them

glory be to him who changes others and remains himself unchanged

holy solitaries is a phrase no more consistent with the gospel than holy adulterers the gospel of christ knows no religion but social no holiness but social holiness

and why im most certainly not  the wall street journal commentary column may

what after all is a halo its only one more thing to keep clean

against logic there is no armor like ignorance

the atheism and nihilism of my earlier years now seems shallow and even a bit cocky

some who grow dull religious straight commence

and gain in morals what they lose in sense

hes never fought with religion what is the point of railing against such beauty such intimate theatre such chime of eternity he can treasure it without believing in it

i dont believe in one holy book i believe all books are holy of course some books are holy shit

one of historys most dangerous games begins with dividing the world into the good guys and the bad guys and ends with using any means necessary to take the villains out

gods will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built so pray for that

the line of communication between god and man is always open unless broken by man himself we are as it were always in the presence of our father in heaven through his holy spirit god is with us always and everywhere

i am accountable

i am correctable

i am transformable

presenting myself a living sacrifice to god

by the love of god

by the word of god

unto all good works

every religion should be in favor of humankind

the better and more realistic test would therefore seem to be in what cause or on what principle would you risk your life

discipline imposed from the outside eventually defeats when it is not matched by desire from within

you can safely assume youve created god in your own image when it turns out that god hates all the same people you do

religion is a salve for confusion and misdirection

it is no longer a question of a christian going about to convert others to the faith but of each one being ready to listen to the other and so to grow together in mutual understanding

thank you for this precious day

these gifts you give to me

my heart so full of love for you

sings praise for all i see

oh sing for every mothers love

oh sing for all the stars above

the peace beyond all fear

prayer is not a means of removing the unknown and predictable elements in life but rather a way of including the unknown and unpredictable in the outworking of the grace of god in our lives

in  the patriarch of constantinople and the pope excommunicated each other

that was the end of holiness for both churches

whether a belief is considered to be a delusion or not depends partly upon the intensity with which it is defended and partly upon the numbers of people subscribing to it

god is universal spluttered the priest

the imam nodded strong approval there is only one god

and with their one god muslims are always causing troubles and provoking riots the proof of how bad islam is is how uncivilized muslims are pronounced the pandit

says the slavedriver of the cast system huffed the imam hindus enslave people and worship dressedup dolls

they are golden calf lovers they kneel before the cows the priest chimed in

while christians kneel before a white man they are flunkies of a foreign god they are nightmare of all nonwhite people

she is standing just behind you just behind your right shoulder

in the silence of the woods polly turned

i cant see her she said

i am happy for you said wazzer handing her the empty mug

but i didnt see anything said polly

no said wazzer but you turned around

not only is this not love i think it is the most diabolical unfairness that was ever taught or devised

basically all the religionssciences and powers of the world boil down to a simple truth the best story teller will win in the end

the presocratic problem

all snap flags

parmenides named his gun the hot power of the stars his gun was one uncreated imperishable timeless changeless perfect spherical spherical was the problem

for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return

the bible when taken metaphorically provides us the truth about god but when taken literally the bible provides as the truth about man

to understand jesus when he stated that he was the way the truth and the life one must first recognize his manner of a walk and believe firmly that his manner is true

he seems to be attracting religions the way a dog attracts fleas

nobody can tell what is right and what is wrong what is righteous and what is evil even if there is a god and i had his teachings right before me i would think it through and decide if that was right or wrong myself

concerning concealment as a symptom of love for krsna

it has been stated although srimati radharani developed a deep loving affection for krsna she hid her attitude in the core of her heart so that others could not detect her actual condition

if you can show people how to build castles make sure you do not neglect building and nurturing your own

scientology does not teach you it only reminds you for the information was yours in the first place

any person who with all the sincerity of heart is in search for god on land or in the sea is worthy of respect

it was masturbation not willpower that made it possible for gazillions of women to walk down the aisle with their reputation and their hymen still intact

some women have been faking orgasms for so long that they sometimes fake one when they are masturbating

this is the reason why atheists protest the god gene and religious will hate and

protest religion as a virus they were blindfolded at an early age and their psychological issues were

the blindfold the facts are often used as weapons rather than information to convey truth

in my experience ideology is a lot like religion its a belief system and most people cling to it long after it becomes clear that their ideology doesnt describe the real world

having a religion doesn’t make a person love or not love others it doesn’t make a person accept or not accept others it doesn’t make a person befriend or not befriend others

being without a religion doesn’t make somebody do or be any of that either

no what makes somebody love accept and befriend their fellow man is letting go of a need to be better than others

let us see rather that like janus—or better like yama the brahmin god of death—religion has two faces one very friendly one very gloomy

the man who counts on the aid of a god deserves the help he doesnt get

as obvious as it is then jesus is bigger than any one religion

id be more willing to accept religion even if i didnt believe it if i thought it made people nicer to each other but i dont think it does

because love wins

and dont waste time worshipping harmony doing good was the worship

everything decided francie after that first lecture was vibrant with life and there was no death in chemistry she was puzzled as to why learned people didnt adopt chemistry as a religion

a moderated religion is as good for us as no religion at all—and more amusing

a religion even if it calls itself a religion of love must be hard and unloving to those who do not belong to it

damn it how will i ever get out of this labyrinth

you have to believe what youre saying if youre going to convince me i just cant break that rule even if i want to

well pray if you like only youd do better to use your judgment

if faith cannot be reconciled with rational thinking it has to be eliminated as an anachronistic remnant of earlier stages of culture and replaced by science dealing with facts and theories which are intelligible and can be validated

scientists seek the lawfulness of events it is the task of religion to fit man into this lawfulness

morality did not begin by one man saying to another i will not hit you if you do not hit me there is no trace of such a transaction there is a trace of both men having said we must not hit each other in the holy place

maybe a new religion will rise now maybe without it man will crumble in cynicism and selfishness because he really needs his gods

im here to tell you there aint much forgiveness in that oldtime religion that particular savior was a mean son of a bitch if you sinned honey he was going to get you no doubt about it

it’s cool when fashion recycles itself it’s not cool when sustainable living does because it means there was and is as i write a period of absolute and possibly irreversible destruction

myths are in factneither primitive nor untrue they are rather a kind of poetry that helps us make sense of the world and our place in it

charles laughingly observedgospel and the blues are really if you break it down almost the same thing its just a question of whether youre talkin about a woman or god

jesus christ says kill me and in  days not only this temple but all temples in the whole world will be out of business this is the most stunning thing any human being has ever said

there are wrongs for which religion makes no provision and of which it has no comprehension

the official was bending over his desk staring at the sergeant

may i ask you a question

have you ever thought you were christ

i cant say that i have but i have considered that god was good to me to let me find what i was looking for if thats what you mean

religion is for those who are scared of hell and spirituality is for those who have been there

whoever treads a path seeking knowledge allah will make easy for him the path to paradise

reported by ibn majah and others fulfilling the conditions of imam al bukhari and imam muslim

the lies western slander which wellmeaning zeal has heaped round this man muhammad are disgraceful to ourselves only

disciples and devotees…what are most of them doing worshipping the teapot instead of drinking the tea

different creeds are but different paths to reach the same god

all simple souls must admire and respect one another saying let us proceed each one along our path to the same goal united in purpose and by means of gods order which in its great variety is in us all

by the very act of arguing you awake the patients reason and once it is awake who can foresee the result

having one king one god one belief they can act singlemindedly

it doesnt matter how many drugs i take im not fulfilled this isnt satisfying theres a spiritual hunger going on everybody feels it if you dont feel it now you will trust me you will

drinking beer is easy trashing your hotel room is easy but being a christian thats a tough call thats the real rebellion

the devil himself can become beauty so we are told to corrupt mankind

faith is not belief in spite of evidence but a life in scorn of the consequences

at the round earths imagined corners blow

your trumpets angels and arise arise

from death you numberless infinities

of souls and to your scattered bodies go

all whom the flood did and fire shall oerthrow

all whom war dearth age agues tyrannies

despair law chance hath slain and you whose eyes

shall behold god and never taste deaths woe

but let them sleep lord and me mourn a space

for if above all these my sins abound

tis late to ask abundance of thy grace

when we are there here on this lowly ground

teach me how to repent for thats as good

as if thou hadst seald my pardon with thy blood

human beings all over the earth have this curious idea that they ought to believe in a certain way and cant really get rid of it

since the order of the world is shaped by death mightnt it be better for god if we refuse to believe in him and struggle with all our might against death without raising our eyes towards the heaven where he sits in silence

everybody was talking about the religious man who committed suicide

while no one in the monastery approved of the mans action some say they admired his faith

faith said the master

he had the courage of his convictions didnt he

that was fanaticism not faith faith demands a greater courage still to reexamine ones convictions and reject them if they do not fit the facts

the mathematicians are the priests of the modern world

every man or woman who loves him they hate him too because hes a hard god a jealous god

nothing is a sin when you obey the orders of a priest

it is the business of a virtuous clergy to censure vice in every appearance of it

catholics form a majority in chile although there are more and more evangelicals and pentacostals who irritate everyone because they have a direct understanding with god while everyone else must pass through the priestly bureaucracy

sermons seldom convert sinners they sometimes goad them into more sin

ask a true scientist a very profound question on his science and he will be

silent ask a true religious person a very simple question on his religion and he will be frenzied

imagination is evidence of the divine and the divine is the imagination of evidence

i want these things because if i didnt i would be dead in the mirrors of those around me i would be nothing i would be an example sunken and easily washed away

but youd get arguments from all kinds of people that the bible has got to be perfect that god would not permit such errors to be made in the holy word

i thought god gave everyone free will which would presumably  and evidently  include the freedom to be incorrect when translating one language into another

stop making me think im believing over here

there is only one allpervading god it has no religion no incarnation it is free from all contaminations

with the gods gone and christ not yet come there was a unique moment from cicero to marcus aurelius when man stood alone nowhere else do i find that particular grandeur

theologians and other clerks

much of human behavior can be explained by watching the wild beasts around us they are constantly teaching us things about ourselves and the way of the universe but most people are too blind to watch and listen

through love tribes have been intermixing colors to reveal a new rainbow world and as more time passes this racial and cultural blending will make it harder for humans to side with one race nation or religion over another

the church and the whorehouse arrived in the far west simultaneously

the laws of god the laws of man

the laws of god the laws of man

he may keep that will and can

not i let god and man decree

laws for themselves and not for me

and if my ways are not as theirs

let them mind their own affairs

their deeds i judge and much condemn

yet when did i make laws for them

please yourselves say i and they

need only look the other way

but no they will not they must still

wrest their neighbor to their will

with jail and gallows and hellfire

and how am i to face the odds

of mans bedevilment and gods

i a stranger and afraid

in a world i never made

they will be master right or wrong

though both are foolish both are strong

and since my soul we cannot fly

to saturn nor to mercury

keep we must if keep we can

these foreign laws of god and man

its the intellectual who transforms the concept of the world into the problem of meaning

gods always behave like the people who make them

these days when christians bicker they exaggerate passion into a legalistic belief and prosperity into a lukewarm belief

lets say i have a mystical soul and a rational brain and like montaigne i am incapable of choosing between them i dont know if i believe in god but i am often tempted to believe

it is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age but if so it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door and this dragon is religion

life is the only thing which can never be replaced when lost

religion is like a rocket use it to raise your consciousness only drop it when you are in your orbit

history would be far different

if we did not tend to hear god

most clearly when we think

he is telling us

exactly what it is

we want to hear

i shoplifted from your height

and got me some

since then

i have been trying

to drop dead

you are all misleading one another and are yourselves deceived the sun does not go round the

earth but the earth goes round the sun revolving as it

goes and turning towards the sun in the course of each

twentyfour hours not only japan and the philippines

and sumatra where we now are but africa and europe

and america and many lands besides the sun does not

shine for some one mountain or for some one island

or for some one sea nor even for one earth alone but

for other planets as well as our earth if you would

only look up at the heavens instead of at the ground

beneath your own feet you might all understand this

and would then no longer suppose that the sun shines

for you or for your country alone

don’t be lookin up at no sky for help look down here at us twisted dreamers

to say that atheism is not a religion is the equivalent of saying anarchy is not really a political creed

the gods not out of mercy have made me strong

challenge the church to do better be more of who christ wants us to be

principles are only tools in the hands of god they will soon be thrown away when they are no longer useful

pious people spoke to god and crazy people imagined that god spoke back

if superstition could contradict science the world may as well be on the back of a turtle but giving into turtle worship was a bridge too far

socrates said the perfect society would be based on a great lie people would be told that lie from the cradle and they would believe it because human beings need to make order out of chaos

through my choices and actions i have learned the most effective way of speaking to god is without saying a word

people who demand signs never believe them when they come

the only relationship where you’ll never have your heart broken is the relationship between you and allah

that was rather interesting mercer said as he filled his coffee mug and passed the thermal carafe to john what do you say for dinner blessed be the serial killers or else the devil would have no one to torment

eve folds her arms schoolgirlishly god expressly forbade it adam said

the snake grins through his fangs admiring eves playacting god is a nice enough chap in his way i daresay he means well but between you and the tree of knowledge he is terribly insecure

insecure he made the entire bloody universe hes omnipotent

our only business is to love god not to ask god for our necessities

religion is so frequently a source of confusion in political life and so frequently dangerous to democracy precisely because it introduces absolutes into the realm of relative values

when god saw fit to bestow such a gift a man with any sense didn’t ask questions

accumulating orthodoxy makes it harder yearbyyear to be a christian than it was in jesus day

faith is the mortar that fills the cracks in the evidence and the gaps in the logic and thus it is faith that keeps the whole terrible edifice of religious certainty still looming dangerously over our world

then why asked the eskimo earnestly did you tell me

the human brain has the unique ability to doubt the reality presented to itself to comprehend the dissonance between ideas and the truth of the surrounding world god knows this and it infuriates him it terrifies him

conversion and zealotry just like revelation and apostasy are flip sides of the same coin the currency of a political culture having more in common with religion than rational discourse

perhaps the hopes i have confessed to are of an illusory nature too but i hold fast to one distinction apart from the fact that no penalty is imposed for not sharing them my illusions are not like religious ones incapable of correction

in order to disprove the assertion that all crows are black one white crow is sufficient

on your quest to spirituality it is often required to suspend your rationality but true spirituality asks that you enhance your rationality

christ came to take away our sins not our minds

or maybe that’s what it’s all about this religion’s substance is its lack of substance

but he had lost god and all his family and friends were staying behind with his imaginary friend a silly dream goes away and takes with it your whole real life

but youve always used words so wordily in crafty defense of your trinity although he never needed such defense before you got him from me as a unity

i fear one day ill meet god hell sneeze and i wont know what to say

a halo is a cock ring for the soul

the church has never been asked to explain anything our speciality along with ballistics has always been the neutralisation of the overly curious mind through faith

in the name of allah the most beneficent the most merciful

all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists

the most beneficent the most merciful

the only owner of the day of recompense ie the day of resurrection

patty believed that parents have a duty to teach their children how to recognize reality when they see it

i had never been into society for me the world was the enclosure of the college and the seminary i had a vague knowledge that there was a something

people didnt really like mcdonalds same as her mum didnt really like catholicism but when you were new in town at least it was a known quantity so thatll be a quarterpounder and a communion wafer mealdeal to go

thats what you get he said nodding towards a group of the men engaged in some closeorder military drill when you give people bibles and guns you should give em either one or the other but not both it just messes up their brains

the story grandpa told us helped me realize that people cannot be divided into groups by ethnicity religion or any other feature only into groups of good bad and indifferent people

spirituality can go handinhand with ruthless singlemindedness when the individual is convinced his cause is just

for hell and the foul fiend that rules

gods everlasting fiery jails

devised by rogues dreaded by fools

with his grim grisly dog that keeps the door

are senseless stories idle tales

dreams whimseys and no more

many buddhist temple priests regard their parishioners as possessions and fear their departure as a diminishing of assets

as long as we were living in the spirit we would continue to be blessed

biblical talmudic or koranic literalists remind me of children wrinkling their noses at belon oysters and asking for more chef boyedee they want the world to be as simple as they are

vanity of vanities says the preacher

vanity of vanities all is vanity

what does man gain by all the toil

at which he toils under the sun

a generation goes and a generation comes

but the earth remains forever

the sun rises and the sun goes down

and hastens to the place where it rises

the wind blows to the south

and goes around to the north

around and around goes the wind

and on its circuits the wind returns

all streams run to the sea

but the sea is not full

to the place where the streams flow

there they flow again

all things are full of weariness

a man cannot utter it

the eye is not satisfied with seeing

nor the ear filled with hearing

what has been is what will be

and what has been done is what will be done

and there is nothing new under the sun

is there a thing of which it is said

see this is new

it has been already

in the ages before us

there is no remembrance of former things

nor will there be any remembrance

of later things yet to be

among those who come after

there either is a god or there is not there is a design or not

i remembered robyn telling me the story of shadrach meshach and abednego and how theyd survived when the king chucked them in the furnace and an angel or someone went in with them the furnace blazed all around them but they didnt burn

i do not believe that to be religious in the best authentic sense a man has to destroy his love life and mummify himself body and soul

god is not a celestial prison warden jangling the keys on a bunch of lifershes a shepherd seeking for sheep a woman searching for coins a father waiting for his son

fear is the polio of the soul which prevents our walking by faith

wallace stevens turns to the idea of the weather precisely as the religious idea turns to the idea of god

believers can have both religion and science as long as there is no attempt to make a nona to make reality unreal to turn naturalism into supernaturalism

god formed an alliance based on the world as it is full of flaws whereas prayer calls god to account for the world as it should be

i know i know moore said mad beliefs like that eh must be some metaphor right must mean something else shook his head what an awfully arrogant thing what if faiths are exactly what they are and mean exactly what they say

stop trying to make sense of it and just listen dane said

and what moore said if a large part of the reason theyre so tenacious is that theyre perfectly accurate

the divine is always abominable

houses under the sea

fundamentalisms strident denunciation of its opponents is a sign of its weakness its dogmatic authoritarianism is a pathological mutation of faith

faith does not imply a closed but an open mind quite the opposite of blindness faith appreciates the vast spiritual realities that materialist overlook by getting trapped in the purely physical

when in reading gaol he told me that the warders in the dock had been gentle and kind but the visit of the chaplain in his first prison began with these words

mr wilde did you have morning prayers in your house

i am sorry i fear not

you see where you are now

in  alone two hundred heretics hadin one of the greatest euphemisms in the history of languagerelaxed that is burned at the stake

dogs of god columbus the inquisition and the defeat of the moors

so if i state in order to pray i am following an innate instinct that is no weaker than the sexual drive  in fact even stronger the two are alike insofar as foul things can happen when they are suppressed

wherein lies happiness in that which becks

our ready minds to fellowship divine

a fellowship with essence till we shine

full alchemiz’d and free of space behold

the clear religion of heaven

we believe that religions are basically the same…they only differ on matters of creation sin heaven hell god and salvation

you just dont have faith frank repeated

well i hope i never get it its like being hit by a hammer in the head

eanna love us adaon preserve us morian guard our souls

i think it was at this point that i decided i would rather remember mailer as the author of harlots ghost and the armies of the night

the oldtimereligion and todays cuttingedgereligion have one thing in common  theyre both religion i want neither

the woman who preaches has poison religion let the respectable ones go

religion has a way of making people into idiots is what my father says

on the exoteric level the traditions are irreconcilable on the esoteric experiential level of the heart reigns an eloquent reverential silence

whether divine or human it is precisely the imagination that fashions and recognizes the universe as meaningful abiding and valuable that is to say as real

more people have died in the name of religion than have ever died of cancer and we try to cure cancer what makes us take up arms against those who pray to the same god with different words

what is it about our specific belief in god and his wishes that makes us so angry at the specific beliefs of another what is it about the teachings of our respective deities that makes us more right than the next person or more wrong

i hallowed out my bible to put another smaller bible inside

god withholds himself from no one who perseveres

it seems to me some people just go around lookin to get their faith unsettled that has been the fashion for the last hundred years or so

same idea he says im jewish because everyone before me was and youre catholic because spanish assholes forcibly converted your ancestors hows that a choice

there are no perfect human beings and even those who we pray such as allah buddha jesus krishna among others were not perfect

the limit of man s knowledge in any subject possesses a high interest which is perhaps increased by its close neighbourhood to the realms of imagination

one of the strengths of the belief in antinous was its appeal to the most sensitive and inward of mystical natures as well as to the exuberant joyous and ecstatic sides of human experience

what did those people teach you he asked me one night mystified what exactly do catholics believe

jason was aghast thorns he whispered but thats the most dangerous part of the rose

the divine voice is not always expressed in words it is made known as a heartconsciousmess

perhaps it is natural for the god of the poor to be akin to the god of the dead for there is something about poverty that smells of death

for what is religion if not a kind of madness and what is madness without a touch of religion

the haggadah was made to teach and it will continue to teach and it might teach a lot more than just the exodus story

what do you mean

manz formerly one of zwinglis closest allies held that there was no biblical warrant for infant baptism refusing to recant his views he was tied up and drowned in the river limmat

like a small stone deflected off a larger one my brother had spun off toward the almighty though to my mind the events of that morning could just as well have cast him the other way

most of witchcraft is just being present

we are no longer so lacking in fantasy as to uphold the existence of a god

domestic society being confirmed therefore by this bond of love there should flourish in it that

again this subjection of wife to husband in its degree and manner may vary according to the

different conditions of persons place and time in fact if the husband neglect his duty it falls to the wife to take his place in directing the family but the structure of the family and its fundamental law

established and confirmed by god must always and everywhere be maintained intact

when law and duty are one united by religion you never become fully conscious fully aware of yourself you are always a little less than an individual

there is nothing like being told to go fuck yourself by the same person who was only days before praying on your behalf

belief in immortality is harmful because it is not in our power to conceive of the soul as really incorporeal so this belief is in fact a belief in the prolongation of life and it robs death of its purpose

our lord is a magic lord as we all desired and magical things have sought him from over there and they all obey his hests

it is so said all but gazic and gazic rose up in a pause of their gladness

many strange things he said have entered our village coming from over there and it may be that human folk are best and the ways of the fields we know

i dont ridicule religion it ridicules itself

first knowledge is the knowledge of god

let me get under your skin i want to know what your fears taste like i want to consume

the fremen have a simple practical religion he said

nothing about religion is simple

if the way of wisdom was easy anyone would have walked in wisdom is not a whore she is a shy mademoiselle so only those who strives wins her heart

if one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child then one million of you are a million times guilty

the lord is god

no crime is a means to an end no crime can be rationalized

if one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty

don’t act based on religion always have a purpose and focus

don’t just bring religion to people but also change their value system

there is a huge difference between living a christian life and living a religious life

i am not a man of god i am too little to be that but once in a while i like to believe in that thing called destiny

ones true religion is what one cares about most

cleanliness begins with the love for godliness

take principles not just religion to people

the gods seldom

but so quickly

one day i realized without god nothing matters so i asked him into my heart

i love the freedom of my wings i love the empty space above the ground i rejoice in my freedom freedom is my religion peace is my god love is my worship

the most boring and unproductive question one can ask of any religion is whether or not it is true

tim minchins musings on tony the first fish ever to have feet

girls aside the other thing i found in the last few years of being at school was a quiet but strong christian faith – and this touched me profoundly setting up a relationship or faith that has followed me ever since

i am so grateful for this it has provided me with a real anchor to my life and has been the secret strength to so many great adventures since

but it came to me very simply one day at school aged only sixteen

as a young kid i had always found that a faith in god was so natural it was a simple comfort to me unquestioning and personal

but once i went to school and was forced to sit through somewhere in the region of nine hundred dry latinliturgical chapel services listening to stereotypical churchy people droning on i just thought that i had got the whole faith deal wrong

maybe god wasn’t intimate and personal but was much more like chapel was … tedious judgemental boring and irrelevant

the irony was that if chapel was all of those things a real faith is the opposite but somehow and without much thought i had thrown the beautiful out with the boring if church stinks then faith must do too

the precious natural instinctive faith i had known when i was younger was tossed out with this newly found delusion that because i was growing up it was time to ‘believe’ like a grownup

i mean what does a child know about faith

it took a low point at school when my godfather stephen died to shake me into searching a bit harder to refind this faith i had once known

life is like that sometimes it takes a jolt to make us sit and remember who and what we are really about

i was devastated

i remember sitting up a tree one night at school on my own and praying the simplest most heartfelt prayer of my life

blow me down … he did

to me my christian faith is all about being held comforted forgiven strengthened and loved – yet somehow that message gets lost on most of us and we tend only to remember the religious nutters or the god of endless school assemblies

this is no one’s fault it is just life our job is to stay open and gentle so we can hear the knocking on the door of our heart when it comes

this really is the heart of what i found as a young teenager christ comes to make us free to bring us life in all its fullness he is there to forgive us where we have messed up and who hasn’t and to be the backbone in our being

faith in christ has been the great empowering presence in my life helping me walk strong when so often i feel so weak it is no wonder i felt i had stumbled on something remarkable that night up that tree

i had found a calling for my life

growth comes from god to those with surrendered yielded hearts

religion starts with desolation and ends with misery

but you do believe don’t you rose implored him you think it’s true

and heaven too rose said with anxiety while the rain fell interminably on

oh maybe the boy said maybe

it will take centuries to disconnect people from an addiction like religion no matter how bad and disastrous it could be but addiction is the worst of all

new rule theres only one thing to say about the christian film and television commission giving me the bigoted bile award and naming religulous the numberone most unbearable movie of  thank you you hate me you really hate me

stand in the divine rain and seeds of wisdom will grow in your soul

if religion has nothing to do with poverty and misery then why the muslims are the largest charity takers of the world

freedom of religion is not enough we need the extinction of it because no one has turned to be a religious by their own choice

if one knew the truth how could there be freedom if hell and paradise were in the middle of the marketplace everyone would be a saint

america isn’t perfect but there’s not a better place in the world for people of any faith

the only successful philosophies and religions are the ones that flatter us whether in the name of progress or of hell damned or not man experiences an absolute need to be at the heart of everything

free will either you follow the word of god or youll be punished with eternal hellfire thats the same kind of choice an abuse boyfriend gives you either you do exactly what i say or ill beat the shit out of you

it never before happened that the rich ruling and more educated minority which has the most influence on the masses not only disbelieved the existing religion but was convinced that no religion is no longer needed

some people have a heart to do evil and they don’t care if you’re muslim or christian

a christian telling an atheist theyre going to hell is as scary as a child telling an adult theyre not getting any presents from santa

mankind accepts good fortune as his due but when bad occurs he thinks it was aimed at him done to him a hex a curse a punishment by his deity for some transgression as though his god were a petty storekeeper counting up the days receipts

there is no beyond there is only here the infinitely small infinitely great and utterly demanding present

i will raise up prophets to make conflicting pronouncements that inevitably will be garbled in transcription resulting in mutually exclusive definitions of orthodoxy from which the openminded will flee in dismay

many of us are confessional giants but ethical midgets

a man who believes everything can be explained by science is just as ignorant as someone who believes everything can be explained by religion

the more he needs god the more deeply he comprehends he is in need of god and then the more he in his need presses forward to god the more perfect he is to need god is nothing to be ashamed of but is perfection itself

lets be sheep of god not sheep of men

if jesus came back and saw what was going on in his name hed never stop throwingup

you know said jehangir breaking the silence its only muslims who use the term innovation to mean something bad

the sad thing is that so many people in the belief that the universe is organized to suit and influence them are willing to sacrifice even the slight cranial capacity with which evolution has equipped us

if you want to get anywhere in religion you got to keep it sweet

prayer aint weakened by distance

yesterday is the last day of the past tomorrow is brimming with hope so today is meant to lived large enjoy your moments

when we remember our identity in christ it changes the way we see these relationships because we no longer base our worth on the approval of others but the approval we have already received from our father through the work of his son

the thing i hate about religion is they ban what they have done and force us to do what they haven’t done

and the voice of god was in the whirlwind after all said thor

religion is the servant of the vanishing science of the existence disappearance belongs to the chaos and the devil existence to the god

to quit religion is to start walking in the space don’t be afraid you don’t fall into the void because you can hold onto god and science

for god’s sake take the religion out of your life or all kind of absurdities will take the reason out of your life keep god get rid of religion god love and science the magnificent trinity all you need is these three things

i dont like to hear cut and dried sermons no—when i hear a man preach i like to see him act as if he were fighting bees

everyone claims to be okay with freedom of religion but the moment you mention god there is a strange tension that fills the air if there was a th sense that would be it

you frighten me when you say there isnt time

i dont see why christians have been expecting the imminent end of the world for millennia

but it keeps not ending

so far so good

destiny waits in the hand of god shaping the still unshapen

you were the one who threatened us with an inquisitor the bishop reminded him with a smile

the speakers smile was just as chilly and youre the one who told the people i was satan and they shouldnt talk to me

you were baptized

from the authors concluding historical note

truth without love isnt

for me the existence of nonexistence of god is a nonissue

at the heart of my argument is the view that religious faith far from being inevitably on the side of the status quo should on principle hold this world to higher standards

sin is a gravitation

christianity contains within itself a germ hostile to the church dietrich bonhoeffer

i wonder how appropriate it is to try to argue someone into the kingdom many apologists hotly deny any such charge but i dont believe them the tenor of almost all apologetics literature makes it plain that this is their intent

my god can do it

my god will do it

my god wants to do it

my god has done it

the wise men posit questions to which they may not always find immediate answers but through their reflections god stimulates man in his search for truth  which in the last analysis is a search for god himself

when god becomes routine rather than revival its time to switch things up

but when i make a good taxidermy mount i feel like i beat god in a small way as though the almighty said let such critter be dead and i said fuck you he can still play the banjo

saying that you are moral because you believe in a god is like saying you are an economist because you play monopoly

i do not concern myself with gods and spirits either good or evil nor do i serve any

why do many believers insist on repeatedly pointing to the crimes of th century dictators who led officially atheistic societies as some sort of evidence of their gods existence it makes no sense

if god created shadows it was to better emphasise the light

submitting seemed to me a lot like giving up if god gave us the strength to bail the gumption to try and save ourselves isnt that what he wanted us to do

the church may update its techniques and methods but it is always in service of the institutional organism this is one of the reasons why the pedophile priest issue is and will remain an endemic disease in the catholic church

pure intuitive faith differs as much from fanaticism as fire from smoke or music from mere noise those who confuse the two are like the deaf

if religion is the cornerstone of morality how come i so often find myself explaining why i don’t hate god to someone who’s expressed hatred for atheists scientists feminists gays intellectuals and all other forms of infidels

what is the difference between a cathedral and a physics lab are not they both saying hello we spy on whales and on interstellar radio objects we starve ourselves and pray till were blue

how do you give something away with the knowledge that you will get it back in three days and then claim it to be the ultimate sacrifice

old religious dogma attempts to convince you that you are on a journey to god then makes you pay tolls along that roadway

religion is not a bridge between god and man it is the great wall of china between them

time will come and some people will be proud of themselves that they have never believed in any religion this honour will be belonging to the clever people of the society only for the others merely the deep shame will remain

petronius says that ‘mundus vult decipi  the world wants to be deceived’ that is very true otherwise there wouldn’t exist any religion

when men follow justice the city blooms the earth bears rich harvests and children and flocks increase but for the unjust all nature is hostile the people waste away from famine and a whole city may reap the evil fruit of one mans ill deeds

religion now has degenerated and it has turned into a wolf it has opened its mouth to show his ugly teeth its spreading fear instead of love and science has hidden in a corner like a lamb trembling with fear

supposing there is no life everlasting think what it means if death is really the end of all things theyve given up all for nothing theyve been cheated theyre dupes

by starving the sensibility of our pupils we only make them easier prey to the propagandist when he comes for famished nature will be avenged and a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head

my religion is no way of knowing me

of all the religions in the world perhaps the religion of liberty is the only faith capable of purity

for every one pupil who needs to be guarded from a weak excess of sensibility there are three who need to be awakened from the slumber of cold vulgarity

what good is all this freethinking modernity and turncoat flexibility if at some gut level you are still a christian a catholic and even a priest

christians rejected the need for proof to support belief in god yet dismissed proof altogether when it was there

hundreds of hysterical persons must confuse these phenomena with messages from the beyond and take their glory to the bishop rather than the eye doctor

the assumption of no god cannot be proven by science  scientific faith

under the thelián sky beyond the great unknown c

zoroastrianism oh there’s never been but a few hundred thousand of them at any one time mostly located in iran and india but that’s it the one true faith if you’re not a zoroastrian i’m afraid you are bound for hell

the man looked stunned and shocked its not fair

the demon gave a mirthful laugh well it was fair when you were sending all the chinese to hell who had never heard of jesus wasn’t it

the realm of god is dangerous you must enter into it and not just seek information about it

im dating myself but this was before jesus christ we worshiped a god named sashatiba who had five eyes including one on the adams apple

duke looked where hawkeye was pointing in one corner kneeling on the dirt floor with his elbows on his cot a bible in front of him his lips moving slowly and oblivious to all about him was major jonathan hobson

it dont look like him duke said

science can destroy religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets no one ever demonstrated so far as i am aware the nonexistence of zeus or thor but they have few followers now

lord i believe help my unbelief is the best any of us can do really but thank god it is enough

so finally we tumble into the abyss we ask god why he has made us so feeble but in spite of ourselves he replies through our consciences i have made you too feeble to climb out of the pit because i made you strong enough not to fall in

one centurys saint is the next centurys heretic  and one centurys heretic is the next centurys saint it is as well to think long and calmly before affixing either name to any man

it is not objective proof of gods existence that we want but whether we use religious language for it or not the experience of gods presence

the will of life and death

never share the same motivation

we all know that love is the ultimate motive to die for

but let’s not kid ourselves

we all know the ultimate motive to rise back from the dead is vengeance

strange are the pictures of the future that mankind can thus draw with this brush of faith and these manycoloured pigments of the imagination strange too that no one of them tallies with another

our father we have killed him and we will kill him again and our world will kill him and yet he is there it is he who listens at the door it is he who is coming it is our father who is about to be born through jesus christ our lord

and what is hell can you tell me that

and should you like to fall into that pit and to be burning there for ever

no sir

what must you do to avoid it

i deliberated a moment my answer when it did come was objectionable i must keep in good health and not die

there is always the poet the lunatic the lover there is always the religious man who is a queer mixture of the three

beyond islam and unbelief there is a desert plain for us there is a passion in the midst of that expanse the knower who reaches there will prostrate there is neither islam nor unbelief nor any where in that place

all right so you believe in santa claus and ill believe in the great pumpkin the way i see it it doesnt matter what you believe just so youre sincere linus

the servant who really studies his master gradually becomes like his master gradually learns that he himself is the one who in the end does all the work and has all the power

we could all use the power of prayer now and then but it seems to me that the people who are sure they have a direct line to heaven are most often calling collect with bad news

organized religion is no longer good news for most people but bad news indeed it set us up for the massive atheism agnosticism hedonism and secularism we now see in almost all formerly christian countries

a man and woman in search of something are always blown apart but its the same wind that blows them

tell me something do you believe in god

snow darted an apprehensive glance in my direction what who still believes nowadays

it isnt that simple i dont mean the traditional god of earth religion im no expert in the history of religions and perhaps this is nothing newdo you happen to know if there was ever a belief in animperfect god

snow hesitated but his attitude no longer showed any of the wary reserve of recent weeks

there was manicheanism

nothing at all to do with the principles of good and evil i broke in immediately this god has no existence outside of matter he would like to free himself from matter but he cannot

snow pondered for a while

i kept on

we already have snow said sarcastically novas and supernovas according to you they are candles on his altar

if youre going to take what i say literally

what gave you this idea of an imperfect god

i dont know it seems quite feasible to me that is the only god i could imagine believing in a god whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purposea god who simply is

when the male organ of a man stands erect two thirds of his intelect go away and one third of his religion

the most powerful force ever known on this planet is human cooperation — a force for construction and destruction

i dont differentiate much except in degree between people who believe in religion from those who believe in astrology magic or the supernatural

human beings are copartners with deity in the project of being this is the basis of all magic

so it is said adso but many tend to believe that its a fable an invention of the pagans

what a disappointment i said i would have liked to encounter one crossing a wood otherwise whats the pleasure of crossing a wood

the humble sage by virtue of true knowledge sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brāhmaṇa a cow an elephant a dog and a dogeater

by reading quotes i realized that some of them containing simple words but this simple words could change our lives

how if we read the holy quran that has the best words  it will change our lives and our death

thank god that i was born muslim

i need just be a bayonet a bayonet named diving punishment i wish id been born a storm or a menace or a single grenade no heart no tears just as a terrible galed have been good if by doing this i become that then so be it

in the name of god they stole her time and her freedom putting shackles on her heart they preached about gods kindness but preached twice as much about his wrath and intolerance

should one continue to follow the faith of a group thats cast him out shouldnt it stand to reason that if he was true to that faith that the group should have been true to him is it unreasonable to ask forgiveness of one who is allforgiving

the sight of her made him understand why hed lost his faith in god

faith which does not doubt is dead faith miguel de unamuno philosopher and writer

all of the worlds religions have important things to teach us and they are not as different from each other as some would have you believe

a belief which leaves no place for doubt is not a belief it is a superstition jose bergamin author

religions are often stateprotected nurseries of pseudoscience although theres no reason why religions have to play that role in a way its an artefact from times long gone

the orgasm has replaced the cross as the focus of longing and the image of fulfillment

from the house of unbelief

to true religion

is a single breath

from the world of doubt

to certainty

is a single breath

enjoy this precious single breath

for the harvest

of our whole lives

is that same one breath

the worship of power is an old religion

ah well i suppose thats the problem with trying to make others follow your own beliefs what starts out as spiritual ardor too often becomes arrogance and bigotry

the sailors the next time they visited these islands the only things still there would be herds of goats or pigs

oyster is telling this story

the sailors called this seeding meat

oyster says does this remind you of anything maybe the ol adam and eve story

looking out the car window he says you ever wonder when gods coming back with a lot of barbecue sauce

the god i believe in isnt short on cash mister

but above all it will confer an inestimable benefit on morality and religion by showing that all the objections urged against them may be silenced for ever by the socratic method that is to say by proving the ignorance of the objector

to every armageddonist every earth lover must keep saying with all the sincerity and affection we can muster may god make this world as beautiful to you as it has been to me

no i said simply i hate no one i want only to be left in peace to understand the mysteries of the universe in my own way

god goes with thoughtless people

but it was a religion which enabled him to despise himself and everyone else without despising the universe thus allowing him at once in argument or conversation to the advantages of the pessimist and the optimist

the quran is gods song not ours not even muhammads to allow such a song to pass through ones body however imperfectly is to discover that the instrument is transformed by the music

god is as real as a station wagon

if a man cannot serve two masters neither can christianity or several thousand of them as the case may be

the catholic chruch as threatened your life  do you not want revenge have you not sold your hatred to the pretestant cause to work against the church that has hunted you

no i said simply i hate no one i want only to be left in peace to understand the mysteries of the universe in my own way

god has already laid out for us the mysteries of the universe or as much as he permits us to understand you think your way is better

better than these wars of dogma that have led men to burn and fillet one another across europe for fifty years yes i do

then what is it you believe

i looked at him i believe that in the end even the devils will be pardoned

ben laughed you think all religions are scams dont you

yes i suppose i do epstein said but the religions are mostly scamming themselves that they scam others is usually a sideeffect

never underestimate the ridiculous things that have been done in the name of religioussemantic obscurity

the quintessential emblem of religion  and the clearest manifestation of the perversity that lies at its core  is the sacrifice of a child by a parent

there is little hope of the repentance and redemption of certain some until they have committed one or another of the many wrong things of which they are daily through a course of unrestrained selfishness becoming more and more capable

the belief that the world was created yesterday seems to hold great appeal to those born at that time

no one is as murderously islamophobic as islamists are

god is merciful cant we all be on the right track of faith but just using different roads

do not exalt any path above god there are many paths that lead to god so people are capable of finding and following the ways that suit them provided they do not stand still

well it just figures younger told him like a man explaining his religion

earth is a homicide victim we lose our children there are wars disease and god comes strolling by like a cosmic billie burke

you heard him say it pains the only evil i know about you heard that

the monk nodded solemnly

and that society is the only thing that determines whether an act is wrong or not that too

dearest god how did those two heresies get back into the world after all this time hell has limited imaginations down there the serpent deceived me and i did eat

on close inspection we shall find that religion and not fear has ever been the cause of the longlived prosperity of an absolute government

the best proof that he will never cease to love us lies in that he never began

making fun of bornagain christians is like hunting dairy cows with a high powered rifle and scope

the theist tells us that the truth is god exists

the atheist tells us that the truth is there is no god

while the truth tells us we dont know

im a religious man he said i dont believe in a particular

god but even so one can have a faith something beyond

the limits of rationality marxism has a large element of

builtin faith although it claims to be a science and not

merely an ideology this is my first visit to the west until

now i have only been able to go to the soviet union or

poland or the baltic states in your country i see an

abundance of material things it seems to be unlimited but

theres a difference between our countries that is also a

similarity both are poor you see poverty has different

faces we lack the abundance that you have and we dont

have the freedom of choice in your country i detect a kind of poverty which is that you do not need to fight for your

survival for me the struggle has a religious dimension and

i would not want to exchange that for your abundance

i am fashionably unimpressed with the material world i am moved by the beauty of aspiration and i hope that i can elevate myself to the standards i have imposed on others

but what is this kindly old gentleman to me and what am i to him just one more member of the race of unfortunates one more shade to go with the many he has seen one more figure to add to his total of executions

maybe we should create a happy god day and make it the one day of the year you cant kill each other

ive still got the bible i stole that night from my revival from some hotel on

some say god exists outside creation if in fact he did breath in adams nostrils he became part of humanity and creation

substance of your belief has nothing to do with the size of the book you use or how often you open it

why would you accept the jesus of the bible if you have rejected the bible of jesus

the most important question i ever asked a priest was where are the bingo dobbers at

atheism is the opium of the mathematicians atheism is the religion of mathematics

the best ideal is the true and other truth is none all glory be ascribed to the holy three in one

science is not about making predictions or performing experiments science is about explaining

oh sometimes i like to put the sand of doubt into the oyster of my faith br cadfael

we hold the future still timidly but perceive it for the first time as a function of our own action

many things the gods achieve beyond our judgement said the sorrowful girl what we thought is not confirmed and what we thought not god contives

if you cant test it its not theorics  its metatheorics a branch of philosophy so if you want to think of it this way our test equipment is what defines the boundary separating theorics from philosophy

mahound comes to me for revelation asking me to choose between monotheist and henotheist alternatives and im just some idiot actor having a bhaenchud nightmare what the fuck do i know yaar what to tell you help help

i wrestled through many sleepless nights after god became real to me i can only describe this period of my life as  years of mental agony

proof is the hallmark of religion

its better to have a million small religions with each one containing a great truth than one great religion containing a million small truths

the tendency to turn human judgements into divine commands turns religion into one of the most dangerous forces in the world

to heck with praying i shouted bail dammit bail

conventionality is not morality selfrighteousness is not religionappearance should not be mistaken for truth narrow human doctrines that only tend to elate and magnify few should not be substituted for the worldredeeming creed of christ

it was she who had saved us she declared by staying up all night praying you get down on your knees and thank your guardian angel she said and thank me too

dad squeezed my shoulder well darling he said maybe the angel was you

surrounded by your glory what will my heart feel

will i dance for you jesus or in awe of you be still

will i stand in your presence or to my knees will i fall

will i sing hallelujah will i be able to speak at all

i can only imagine

i can only imagine

the world of fundamental religion does not recognize even the slightest variation in meaning should this meaning fall outside its own definition of truth

other translations may engage the mind but the king james version is the bible of the heart

gods are but greater demons the cishaurim said hungers across the surface of eternity wanting only to taste the clarity of our souls can you not see this

i have taken all my good deeds and all my bad deeds and cast them … in a heap before the lord and fled from both and betaken myself to the lord jesus christ and in him i have sweet peace

whereas cognitive constraints on negative emotions can reduce distress freeing positive emotions from such constraints can enhance religious experience

i consider that the chief dangers which confront the coming century will be religion without the holy ghost christianity without christ forgiveness without repentance salvation without regeneration politics without god and heaven without hell

i think that gnosticism is about discovering the way that god has turned into you and then realizing that if you can describe how it is that god turned into you you can reverse the process

when religious groups in a conflict eliminate the personal element and perceive themselves as representatives of collectives heir actions tend to become more radical and merciless ch by jaco cilliers p

to whom life is an experience to be carried as far as possible

i have not meant to express my thought but to help you clarify what you yourself think

you are not any more different from me than your right leg is from your left but what joins us is the sleep of reason—which produces monsters

there is a purpose in lifeto raise men nearer to the likeness of god whoever seeks that ideal daily finds joy and in no other way can true joy be found

criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower

true freedom which is full joy is the complete recognition of law and adaptation to it bondage comes from ignorance of law or opposition to it

no man  can be so stupid to deny that all men naturally were born free being the image and resemblance of god himself

i must not like the quietists reduce all religion to a denial of any specific action despising all other means since what makes perfection is gods order and the means he ordains is best for the soul

the prayer of a trained theurgist is like the majestic flow of a large river but an ignorant and weak person can produce only something similar to an irregular trickle from a halfclogged tap

let it be stated clearly that mysticism is an arational type of experience and in some degree common to all men

it is an intuitive selfevident selfrecognized knowledge which comes fitfully to man it should not be confounded with the instinctive and immediate knowledge possessed by animals and used by them in their adaptations to environment

the best religion or practice is the one that makes us better

the padres set great store by addressing prayer to personal gods genuine prayer exists only in religions in which there is a god as a person and a shape and endowed with a will

that was stated by a famous protestant the anarch does not want to have anything to do with that conception as for the one god while he may be able to shape persons he is not a person himself and the he is already a patriarchal prejudice

the better men know the lord the better may the eternal truths we learn be applied in our daily lives

if we talk about the living oracles and want to pay respect to them how shall we do this shall we do it by never reading their wordsby paying not attention to that which they say that is a very poor way of doing

like all religious people christians repress remember and retell their core stories selectively they emphasize this episode at the expense of that episode in keeping with their own biases and the preoccupations of their times

it is the business of man to become acquainted with the material universe in all of its manifestations so far as may be possible in order to provide a foundation of knowledge on which the reasoning mind of man may increasingly build

their rustic faith was well served by a flotilla of light aircraft a powerful radio an ultramodern hospital and fourwheeldrive vehicles  in short all the equipment that a battalion of crusaders dropped behind enemy lines needed

the best existential analysis of the human condition leads directly into the problems of god and faith

writing my own novels in the si never imagined that in ten years science and rationality would require explanation and defense in a world rocked and ruled by religious fervor

some people do polarizing the religion against science

i use both to solve a problem with two different kind of approach

belief must be something different from a mixture of opinions about god and the world and of precepts for one life or for two piety cannot be an instinct craving for a mess of metaphysical and ethical crumbs

wallace stevens turns to the idea of the weather precisely as the religious man turns to the idea of god

my mother was a good catholic  she went to mass twice a week at st marys in richmond but my father was an orthodox eclectic

xas sighed but i dont want to talk about god why do i sometimes i feel god is all over me like a pollen and i go about pollinating things with god

sobran opened his eyes and xas smiled at him soban said i did think that you talked about god to persuade me you werent evil but ive decided that for you everything is somehow to the glory of god whether you like it or not

i feel that yes my imagination was first formed in gods glory but i think god didnt make the world so i think my feelings are mistaken

most of the book deals with things we already know yet never learn

the reason why the continental european is to the englishman or american so surprisingly ignorant of the bible is that the authorized english version is a great work of literary art and the continental versions are comparatively artless

there is a faculty in man that will acknowledge the unseen he may scout and scare religion from him but if he does superstition perches near

but that which fanaticism formerly promised to the elect science now accomplishes for all men

a great many small failures have brought me to this

dark room where against the teachings of the church

i lie in the forgiving dark with you and we kiss

and loosen our clothing and feel the hot urge

the slow unbuttoning unclasping until at last

we lie revealed the fine sensation

of you on my skin a slender woman as vast

as montana and i am now heading west

on a winding road through the dark contours

of mountains and into a valley coming to rest

in a meadow that i recognize as yours

this is what i drove across north dakota to find

this sweet nest and put all my failed life behind

a solemn day barring a stay by sup ct  with my final nod utah will use most extreme power  execute a killer mourn his victims justice

i just gave the go ahead to corrections director to proceed with gardners execution may god grant him the mercy he denied his victims

we will be streaming live my press conference as soon as im told gardner is dead watch it at wwwattorneygeneralutahgovlivehtml

my statement to harris that his book contains much to admire is specious hyperbole in the end of faith harris rails against religious fundamentalism which seems obvious as well as against religious moderates which seems intolerant

science is a trigger of changes of civilization

religion is the failsafe of science performance

religion has a good place and it has its good people

faith he had learned that night in front of the flickering television was most glorious when it was most untouched by reason

the turmoil and dislocations confronting presentday society will not be solved until both the scientific and religious genius of the human race are fully utilized

when the highest value in a community is loyalty to the greater cause meaning the continuity of the status quo all means to this end are imbued with religious significance and are thereby justified hasidic noir

the language of intrinsic human rights represented a significant advance beyond the previous language of world religions in terms of its universal applicability and its thiswordliness

it is evident as a matter of logic that since they world religions disagree not more than one of them can be true

there is only one religion  it is a way a man dies

there is in us all that line that prevents us from fully understanding those who are different

you may substitute knowledge for superstition without satisfying the needs that drive people into superstitions arms

the doctrine of the material efficacy of prayer reduces the creator to a cosmic bellhop of a not very bright or reliable kind

gods were preserved but languages were exterminated thus was the conqueror’s will

if you are on the path and see the buddha walking toward you kill him

on the church vaulting above was the clockface of eternity void of number and serving as its own hand only one black finger was pointing and the dead wanted to tell the time by it

the heart of their walsingham witnesses religion seemed to lie in disproving the religion of others

the clothes have no emperor

give a man a fish and he will eat for a day teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime give a man religion and he will die praying for a fish

i prayed you felt safe full of joy and content that when i whispered i love you you knew what i meant

i pray all that you do brings love and brings light

i think that all things  in their way reflect heavenly truth the imagination not the least

your beliefs shape your life when you allow someone to speak into your life you give them power to coauthor your life story and destiny if you believe what they say then those things will mostly likely come to pass

regret is one of the most common symptoms of the illusion of free will

life is indeed short so eating dessert first is an appropriate religion for many

in eras of intense uncertainty a nations people retreat into the tribes in which they feel the most secure

the golden rule applies to everyone not just the living

people are just people some of us hold the same beliefs some of us do not

god cares not what clothes we wear for they can neither show nor hide who we really are

if there is not one god how do different gods answer prayers

religion seeks to lift us from everyday matter towards spirit while magic seeks rather to bring spirit down into everyday matter while religion often reflects a quest for meaning magic is more about sowing seeds of meaning

religion and science are paths of denial in the sense that a scientific statement should be one capable of being disproved while a religious statement should be capable of being disbelieved

i wasted all of my

outrage on my fucking religion

it should have been wasted on god

cut out the middle man

religion is the nurture of backbiting tales vomited by authoritarians eaten by subalterns

religion is poetry the great abuse of religion is that so many should treat it like prose

among other things culture is the decision as to how a corpse is to be returned to the soil

not believing in something does not protect you from it

slán agus beannachtai dé oraibh goodbye and god’s bleesing be on you provided you aren’t wearing a rainbow pin

god doesnt hate you for what youve done wrong he loves you for what youre trying to do right

an astronomically overwhelming majority of the people who could be born never will be you are one of a tiny minority whose number came up be thankful that you have a life and forsake your vain and presumptuous desire for a second one

theology is a study of the series of disagreements that are the worlds religions atheism fundamentally disagrees with these disagreements that preceded it

as we love god wish to see him develop a sense of belonging and work for him faith blossoms to produce refuge in him refuge is about leaving everything to god

god accepts whatever is offered with love whether it is a meal a piece of clothing a chant mantra a thought or the soul jiva

differences between humans are not a reason to be separated but to unite and share what we know in our ways

if egyptian pyramids where in india they would be temples and mummies would be prayed as gods

an atheist would not stand against any religion or worships but he rather helps you understand the science behind it

whenever i read the term belief system somewhere between my eyes and my brain it becomes coping mechanism

i am the problem myself

i am the solution as well

i am the defeated myself

i am the conqueror as well

i am the atheist myself

i am the believer as well

i am the life myself

i am the death as well

i am the god myself

i am the devil as well

i am the problem myself

i am the solution as well

i am the defeated myself

i am the conqueror as well

i am the atheist myself

i am the believer as well

i am the death as well

i am the god myself

i am the devil as well

if you have been converted easily or following religion of your ancestors dont think you are an innocent you are a monkey with a fragile identity

things only exist because other things exist else nothing will exist

my life is what i make of it

humor is next to godliness

when one considers such ancient times ones only recourse is the language of poetry thus legends myths creation accounts history all are no more than stories shaped to justify the present appearance of things

todays religions where once books for education its just that people eventually forgot to get the knowledge from the books and started to pray it

people got creative creativity became stories stories became books books became religions characters became gods religions became differences differences limited the creativity in people

the god of the philosophers disappeared behind the world because he was described in the third person and not addressed in the second

that word is nazi nobody cares about their motives anymore

what if god doesnt want me to be big things for him like at all what if he just wants me to talk to him and know him and live an ordinary live where i love him and my neighbours well

facts about jesus that i told kimberly to annoy her

jesus was a socialist

jesus was a refugee

jesus was opposed to the accumulation of wealth

jesus was silent on the issues of homosexuality and gay marriage

jesus was a brownskinned middle easterner who wore sandals to the dinner table

jesus was a friend to prostitutes

islam is growing faster not because of terror it is because of truth  peace

the reality of the gospel is greater than reason

the big difference between chaos and shalom is rhythm chaos is unpredictable and unrhythmic it has no set cadence but shalom is more like a dance that depends on the rhythm in music

hurry is violence on the soul

americas state religion is patriotism a phenomenon which has convinced many of the citizenry that treason is morally worse than murder or rape

faith is full assurance of gods faithfulness

we have not free but caged will

religion and nationalism as well as any custom and any belief however absurd and degrading if it only connects the individual with others are reduced from what man dreads isolation

salvation is saving from sin

what if god doesnt want me to do big things for him like at all what if he just wants me to talk to him and know him and live an ordinary live where i love him and my neighbours well

there is a document that records gods endless dispiriting struggle with organized religion known as the bible

i could see mount sodom beyond the distant shores where the goat had been chosen as a sacrifice to redeem the wicked tribe

answers are easier to come by and less reliable than questions if religion is an answer if political ideology is an answer then literature is an inquiry great literature by asking extraordinary questions opens new doors in our minds

loyalty is usually a vice when it comes to things such as beliefs

food disciplines are part of every great religion psychologically theyre almost inevitable and extremely practicalreligious discipline is nothing but a permanent psychic shelter

people make a priest even though he must be ordained by a bishop

i only trust people who live with reality and karma to guide them most religions pay little or no attention to either

it is the effects on the world of successful active germline replicators that we see as adaptations

the encyclopedias are empty there are people who trick you and deliver emptiness with a smile while others rob you of your selfrespect you need to remember who you are

you showed me that my past didnt make me unworthy to receive the nearness of god in the elements i could stand before the table of grace a whole person  deeply flawed and still incredibly valued handmade by a loving god

on her first day at the school her mother had explained to her she was about to enter the devils lair filled her satchel with two hundred copies of the watchtower and instructed her to go do the lords work

how odd i had expected to find a cross mcgilliveray said

with a wary expression he let go of the bag so that alan could tuck it

back into his shirt the white mans cross is offcenter there is no

sense of being centered and the directions lead off to nothing which

is why all white men all christians are so unhappy and want to have

dominion i saw the old roods the celtic crosses of your people in the

long ago which had circles around the center but the directions go

beyond the circle they must have been close to the truth in those

days but even so they never really knew peace

the church planted the seeds of servility in republicans and trump simply watered them they had been looking for their godking for a long time

religion and nationality are made up categories all we are are human beings flesh and blood

there is no such thing as a jewish or muslim or christian person we are all one flesh

man passes from the work to the producer of the work and he sees that an allbeauteous maker wants to make himself known and acquainted through the miracles of his own art and he responds with knowledge and belief

the world is a guest house man is to remain there only for a short time and is charged in this brief life with gathering all the supplied necessary for eternal life

any kind of extreme in any religion is dangerous its just a way to control and violate the basic human rights of others they diminish god in our world

religion offers the masses two things a roadmap for life and an escape route from death

religion does have a tendency to cling to power that is the nature of the beast it lends spiritual credibility to barbaric acts is given protection and sustenance in return

both sets are mad yazz

religion is a bludgeon in the hand of the oppressor to suppress the oppressed

if monkeys were religious before evolution we would never have coming down from the trees of africa

the blackboard which was to serve for demonstrations was represented by a very elegant young priest who i suppose celebrated the law of falling bodies as a mass is celebrated

sure way to pull down any faith or religion is to overpopulate to the extent that humanity goes for a toss but humanity will win eventually as faith is the byproduct of humanity

it takes a certain amount of intelligence and bravery to live your life without someone constantly telling you how to live it

most people do not know or cannot accept what they are and that this present reality is all that there is the past is just a memory and the future merely an expectation there is only one continuous present moment the now

this explains concepts such as religion the afterlife and reincarnation

it explains why women butcher their bodies with cosmetic surgery and breast implants

it also explains why people make unrealistic promises when they marry though they are not swans are not biologically monogamous

they deny primal instincts such as violence hate and war naturally exist inside them for they are the great pretenders

like most scientists i am not a dualist but i am nevertheless easily capable of enjoying vice versa and laughing gas

if our effort to know god more clearly is not an effort to love him more dearly it will be fatal

everything exists because other things exist

social media will prove to be the death bed of all religions

faith is to believe and knowledge is accomplished through death

what is religion

its a doctrine that prescribes a way of living built on rituals created to give a sense of security

was it true

no but it was a way for the priests to gain control and unfortunately it divided people …

his expression made me think of oldtimey illustrations of god severely paternal bestowing the kind of love that weighs and measures before it find you worthy

regarding spirituality some have knowledge some have faith but many have neither

the most detestable wickedness the most horrid cruelties and the greatest miseries that have afflicted the human race have had their origin in this thing called revelation or revealed religion

if this person i kept telling myself was one of god’s chosen salesmen on earth then there must be something very wrong about the whole business

faith is life and knowledge is death

i don’t know what is more frightening a creature on a small planet worshipping itself and its world as if infinity did not exist or a creature who burns its fellow beings because the infinite does exist

faith is to suspect something is there and knowledge is to encounter it

islam isnt about ayats and hadiths and niches and lamps its about us all of us allah’s too big and too open for my islam to be small and closed

to desire heaven is to delight in holiness

on religion – oxymoron – definition a combination of contradictory or incongruous words such as cruel kindness broadly something such as a concept that is made up of contradictory or incongruous elements

this is whats become of us i am

confused by mourning and he is the sun

that goes to sleep on top of me undone

by moonrise lover all i speak is iambs

and slant rhyme that devil lamb

of light called hope is sacrificed and none

too pleased with having lost its bleat the stone

has rolled away but gods not gone and damn

it im no fan of the weather here it rains

too often bones of doves and angel down

until the ground stains red with sighs and blood

it is wet and cold will you explain

again the why of all there is and how

he caught me in the act discovering god

i ain’t against gods and goddesses in their place but they’ve got to be the ones we make ourselves then we can take ’em to bits for the parts when we don’t need ’em anymore see

i believed he would once again embrace the knowledge that there is no pure evil no pure good only purity

and i say a final last prayer this one in gratitude that there are people in the world who will protect kids with a fire that makes them sprint after cars fight systems curse with rage

its enough to make you believe

maybe not in symbols maybe not in gods but certainly in people

he would continue to believe in it whatever the facts turned out to be what else was the meaning of belief

whats more absurd than one person telling another how to live

books are big enough and powerful enough to define and contain identityaaron lansky

the patriarchy hurts everyone and patriarchy isnt rule by men its rule by fathers most men will never be the fathers theyre just sons and sons gets sacrificed to keep the old man in port and cigars

the way i understand things the bible may have been thought out by god but it was written down by men and like everything men write down such as the newspapers they got the main story right but some of the details wrong

many of us dont experience god because weve grown lazy and bored we expect to receive the benefits of religion without putting anything into it

the word of god is also like vitamins you don’t want it but you need it in order for you to be strong

science and religion really don’t have much to do with each other

the world is mad

if i tell the truth

they rush to beat me

if i lie they trust me

hindus claim ram as the one

then they kill eachother

knowing not the essence

my religion is love that i have learned from my religion

euthanasia is against my religion so i decided to murder her

climbing a mountain whether metaphorical or physical in order to segregate oneself into spirituality is not spirituality at all if you must hide the candle flame from the darkness then it is not really a candle flame is it

war between religions and science will never end because they speak difference languages there is a lack of communication between them

what if rich did not have to mean wealthy and whole did not have to mean healed what if being people of the gospel meant that we are simply people with good news god is here we are loved it is enough

if when i die i come face to face with god i will allow him to seek my forgiveness

there is no god noone directs the universe

for centuries it was believed that disabled people like me were living under a curse that was inflicted by god i prefer to think that everything can be explained another way by the laws of nature

god realized that he had no concept of the skills required to run an organization of this magnitude

witchcraft is not inherently a religion thought it can be for some witchcraft is more of a spirituality or rather how one relates to the world of spirit and that’s going to be unique and individual for each witch

god just isnt in you

hes in everything

institutional spiritual life needs you more than you need institutional spiritual life why because the former cannot live without you

i was brought into this world

from a prayer palms together

but never once did you expect me

to be your biggest regret

any type of violence is against god against religion against spirituality against humanity and against nature maturity comes only through nonviolence love and allinclusiveness

you have learnt so much

and read a thousand books

have you ever read your self

you have gone to mosques and temples

have you ever visited your soul

you are busy fighting satan

have you ever fought your

you have reached into the skies

but you have failed to reach

whats in your heart

the weird thing about the bible is that almost everything in it is a metaphor

so that’s also church right

i know this might seem blasphemous but my priest tells me its okay to ask questions even if they seem bizarre

having faith is great but beliefs are so dangerous some people end up selling their souls to the religions

love for you

is larger than the usual romantic love it’s like a religion it’s

love of god he said slowly searching for words is not always

the same as love of good i wish it were that simple we know what

is good it is written in the commandments but god is not

contained only in the commandments you know they are only an

infinitesimal part of him a man may abide by the commandments

and be far from god

when man is at his best he outweighs the worth of god as a whole

im different i dont see any differenceindifferences

i offer the book relying on the maxim of rabbi tarfon in ethics of the fathers the work is not yours to finish but neither are you free to take no part in it

it brought tears to my eyes because for the first time in my life i was experiencing unconditional love

a human being possessed by a belief and not eager to pass it on to others is a phenomenon alien to the earth where our mania for salvation makes life unbreathable

in fact a religion has two aims one is to really make those who are good and go up through cultivation obtain the proper way the other is to maintain the morality of human society on a quite high level

you dont know me you never knew my heart no man knows my history i cannot tell it i shall never undertake it i dont blame any one for not believing my history if i had not experienced what i have i would not have believed it myself

your humanity is your divinity

in the spiritual path if you are dependent on any person or organisation you can’t grow at some point in time you need to drop all dependency and walk alone with all humbleness and sincerity in the silence of mind eternity arises

a belief in nothing is just as much a belief as a belief in something

god is in every particle in the universe no religion no prophet can make division on it

what it was he had chiefly gained a fascination with the complexity of the intellectual bastions which men could construct to withstand the tides of disbelief his own disbelief had remained unshaken

as mortals called on god on angels and saints as they chanted while telling their rosary raphael was pronouncing the only names that were sacred to him and would not burn his tongue to utter raphael was calling on his family

i have a thirst for revolution

there is only one thing we should teach our children

to learn by themselves

idolatrous frenzy is that something like traditional religion asks bangs

yeah it is says sweetie im a pagan catholic moving on

she has decided to appear to nobody but the feckless

there is no history or evidence that god from two religion fought each other

you either believe that you know or you just believe

no one is wrong unless what you take from religion is aggression

the difficult we do now

the impossible takes a little longer

spiritual metamorphosis not religious conversion

politics is not going to save this world science and technology are not going to save this world religion and spirituality are not going to save this world  what will is our understanding of which belongs where and to what extent

making a movie on humanity caste is yet to be finalised

there are two ways to dehumanize the first is to strip people of all virtue the second is to clear them of all sin

there are so many different faiths how do you know the holy book you have been brought up with is the true one and if all the others are wrong what makes you think your holy book isn’t wrong too

religion has not civilized man  man has civilized religion god improves as man advances

the biggest religion in the world is not christianity or islam its illogic

the only clear line i draw these days is this when my religion tries to come between me and my neighbor i will choose my neighbor jesus never commanded me to love my religion

the person of faith cannot accept reason as the arbiter of truth without giving up on faith

religion is the fuel which is used to set peace on fire

first whenever a man talks loudly against religion always suspect that it is not his reason but his passions which have got the better of his creed

this is a sad story of three brethren kings hijackers of the mind who obviously need no wings three snatchers of religion three monarchs with ambition

what is it that we seek through greed if it isnt the abandonment of our souls

failing to understand the dogma of our faith had always been my goto excuse for never trying to maybe i wanted too much to reign in the center of my own world leaving no room at the inn for divine suppositions

the sons of mary seldom bother for they have inherited that good part

but the sons of martha favour their mother of the careful soul and the troubled heart

and because she lost her temper once and because she was rude to the lord her guest

her sons must wait upon marys sons world without end reprieve or rest

it is their care in all the ages to take the buffet and cushion the shock

it is their care that the gear engages it is their care that the switches lock

it is their care that the wheels run truly it is their care to embark and entrain

tally transport and deliver duly the sons of mary by land and main

his life he said was much less important than his soul  wolf

i don’t believe god will punish you for looking differently at the pattern of life god is good it’s man who is evil  ware

you see how it shocks and horrifies you our religion is based on the holy books and you cannot conceive that they’re not perfect you’re afraid that if one lie exists the entire fabric could be rotten  ware

i am well aware of how i distract myself from the mundanity of life

the old myths lie about the gods but they tell the truth about people

to feel nothing to know nothing to be nothing to have nothing no wonder man invented heaven

as long as we blame others for our issues and don’t take personal responsibility we remove ourselves from god’s provision and his correction forgiveness and restoration
