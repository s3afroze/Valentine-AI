thank you mr secretary general unicef executive director excellencies and distinguished guests from across the world

my name is kim nam jun also known as rm the leader of the group bts it’s an incredible honour to be invited to an occasion with such significance for today’s young generation

our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their action and enthusiasm we truly have the best fans in the world

i would like to begin by talking about myself

i was born in ilsan a city near seoul south korea it’s a beautiful place with a lake hills and even an annual flower festival i spent a happy childhood there and i was just an ordinary boy

i would look up at the night sky in wonder and dream the dreams of a boy i used to imagine that i was a superhero saving the world

in an intro to one of our early albums there is a line that says my heart stopped…i was maybe nine or ten

i had one sanctuary and that was music there was a small voice in me that said ‘wake up man and listen to yourself but it took me a long time to hear music calling my name

even after making the decision to join bts there were hurdles most people thought we were hopeless sometimes i just wanted to quit

i think i was very lucky that i didn’t give it all up

i’m sure that i and we will keep stumbling and falling we have become artists performing in huge stadiums and selling millions of albums

but i am still an ordinary twentyfouryearold guy if there’s anything that i’ve achieved it was only possible because i had my other bts members by my side and because of the love and support of our army fans

i would like to say one last thing

so let’s all take one more step we have learned to love ourselves so now i urge you to speak yourself

i would like to ask all of you what is your name what excites you and makes your heart beat

tell me your story i want to hear your voice and i want to hear your conviction no matter who you are where you’re from your skin colour gender identity speak yourself

find your name find your voice by speaking yourself

i’m kim nam jun rm of bts

i’m a hiphop idol and an artist from a small town in korea

like most people i made many mistakes in my life

i have many faults and i have many fears but i am going to embrace myself as hard as i can and i’m starting to love myself little by little

what is your name speak yourself

in a thousand years nobody will remember the naysayers and meek worshippers but your work will write your name upon the very fabric of time in golden engravings

youre not what people or situations call youyou are what you answer

write what you cant say feel what you cant explain

dont complain if youre facing hard moments in life challenge yourself to face it challenge yourself to beat it

life is not days or years past or probable future life is now life is countless moments of now

every single one of that moments

is a point in time in which you decide

what you choose to make your life to be

we are not twigs being carried down the current of a river

we are the creators never at a mercy of some outside forces so stop finding excuses and feeling small you will seek that feeling only when youre trying to avoid responsibility

we are free to choose

but yes that requires courage

it requires stepping out of the comfort zone and actually working hard for what matters most

it requires responsibility

it requires a leap of faith into the unknown

so when writing the story of your life

are you the one whos holding the pen

hold your ground and walk your path

deaf to misconceptions fears and doubts

of those who dont dare to live their own lives

walk your path fearless like a lion

and tender like morning dew

what is my goal

what is my task

what is my path through life

must be this trail

bringing hope to strife

i was born with memory

of the future world

the one of love and reverie

the one that once got sold

i cried and shrieked

when losing sight of you

that i was to walk through

rivers they again will flow

skies just open roads

hearts of men again will glow

i am the light of the world which descended in the swamp of lie and cleaned it i am the hair of the woman washing your feet and the eyes crying for your wounds

to think about not thinking is essentially the human condition the fall active unconsciousness

to live is to be and to see is to accept to think is to deny and to desire is to doubt

to create and build is the longest growing branch of our tree for most people it never bears leaves or fruit because it never gets enough sunlight

words are the root of disease unconscious thought active or autonomous are anesthesia for the terminal illness of self or the ego

to attempt to manifest what you want without passion is like dressing up a corpse

things you say no to and the things you say no to knowing define each moment

your body is a reflection of your amount of peace with the universe

as our eyes are open we see all that we have created everything we see and or experience is mirror of our conscious omnificence good or bad

measurement is an illusion

if you spend enough time in the future or past you will realize neither exist or existed

answers come from solving problems with new problems must everything have an answer

do you need to know that you are happy to be happy

thoughts are a way of concealing the truth

if we live to change the world we lose our life if we let the world be our life will change the world

between the love

and the lust

between the feelings

and the hormones

between the heart

and the body

love feelings and the heart

i want you to stop looking at the world in such a judgmental and horrible way perhaps it’s not the right way

life can be a dream life can be a beautiful mess but people make it hard with too much of ego jealousy anger and aggression

the one who tells you

you are not beautiful

the one who cannot

see the good in you

the one who cannot

cheer you up but

instead plays with

your heart is broken

they are all broken

don’t break yourself for any

they tell you

that the world will love you back

if you love yourself enough

i am sorry to say

it doesn’t really work in that way

know your worth

when someone treats you like

you are ordinary

know your worth

when he fails to appreciate you

know your worth

when he tells you that

he no longer needs you

know your worth

when she cannot love you fully

know your worth

they tell you

that the world will love you back

if you love yourself enough

i am sorry to say

it doesn’t really work in that way

don’t forget to

raise your voice

when their words

hurt your soul

don’t forget to shove

when they try to hush you

if every time you look

at yourself and

all that you can see is

the ruined mascara

dry lips and burning eyes

that’s the proof for you

to pack your bags and leave

if they bury you

with the roses and

burn you alive

with their words

that’s the proof for you

to pack your bags and leave

don’t forget to

raise your voice

when their words

hurt your soul

don’t forget to shove

when they try to hush you

damn the tunnels and fuck those who wait for the light at the end of it

just stop wasting your time and learn to be your own kind of light …

it needs efforts to catch time on time

success can not be defined until purpose is known

if only we realize who we are and who god is we will find everlasting happiness

forget the mist and forge the sun comes out everyday

make every day your lifes work make every moment your lifes work

expression should not be selfseeking true art in any form illuminates presence freedom and submission to truth

nothing that is perfect can be taught

when you have no one to help your helpless

growth occurs at the intersection of thoughtful encouragement and action

complete and uninterrupted awareness of one’s self beyond the scope of material form and removed from worldly creation is pure consciousness to be is to simply be

when you are your only competition in life the only person you ever have to prove anything to is yourself

we are divine energy simplicity and complexity made to be

your unconscious mind is like a program that is constantly searching for problems to solve

there is no such thing as tomorrow it simply does not exist

when we choose to spread negativity the bad vibes or focus too much on spreading rumors and gossiping about the other person it doesn’t show who that other person is but it shows who we are to the world

love yourself as you are instead of focusing too much on the outer beauty one must always choose to value the inner beauty your skin and the hair color doesn’t really matter none of them defines who you truly are

life is strange life can give you everything even when you don’t desire for anything and life can take away your entire happiness when you need it the most

count your blessings focus on what you’ve got spread the positive vibes

if someone ever tells you that you are not beautiful tell them that you feel pity seeing their colorless mind and heart

life can be unpredictable life can be tough and cruel life can be unfair sometimes life can be worth living and life can take away everything and can change at any moment life can also be beautiful sweet and amazing

always remember that you can only wake up a person who is sleeping it is impossible to wake up a person who is pretending to be asleep

its about creating a path together

throwing away the rocks on the difficult roads

and continuing the journey

its about building a future together

without failure there’s no learning without failure there’s no discovery without failure there’s no progress

society creates societal values and mores for all to follow at least in public most however deviate from these values and do so privately

happiness based on happenings are fleeting

you can see the crap in life or you can see the cool

there is nothing powerful than selfbeliefs

happiness is a state of mind

its living with peace and joy

its being able to laugh and smile

playing with life like its a toy

world domination means conquering the space around you finding happiness in your everyday because there is no real world just the one you create

we all have different dreams and different worlds we want to dominate your favorite food is someone elses phobia your dream job is someone elses worst nightmare your perfect world is unique to you

your perfect world is powered by passion

find the things that light you up

you can put your foot on the path to exactly what you want this second when you open that book or go online today you are carving out a direct link to your perfect world

figuring out what you dont want is just as important as knowing what you do want

dont be afraid of not being perfect it might be what makes you amazing

you cant make anyone do anything but you can knock on doors until the right one opens

we are all on the same planet but not in the same world

no one can tell you how the world is  because the world is defined as you go

listen to the part of you that is made of the same stuff as stars the same stuff as shakespeare that part knows for sure that you are special that your life has a purpose greater than anything you can imagine thats the part worth listening to

what if like superman everyone is born with powers to discover and grow into and what if like batman everyone has resources to uncover and utilize

seize the wind i whispered dont become the kite that never flies

motivation is the fuel of your life so never let it run out

life means a struggle to makes it better

he knew that just by gazing at those flowers something from within him started to live again

for a long time he tried to convince himself that he was content for a long time he tried to ignore another kind of hunger within him a hunger that could never be satisfied no matter how much he ate

you reminded me of what i lack sometimes its the right place to begin

begin what the boy asked

the right place to begin looking for what you need to find

i know we cant do anything about those who couldnt even say theyre sorrybut maybemaybe we can do something about how we feel inside

you say those things because you haven’t felt what i felt don’t you know how painful it is to be abandoned by your dearest friend

it’s true i have never been abandoned by my best friend even so i think no one is really exempt from being hurt i was hurt tooand you may not know how i felt likehow it felt liketo be abandoned by your own mother

he had always held on to his pain as though it were the biggest pain in all that world but now now he felt he could no longer hold on to it his awareness of the boy’s pain somehow made him forget about his own

look herethis shell is unique i think i could gather all the seashells in the world and i would still fail to find another one like this as beautiful as this in the same way i think that’s how you are

even if you can’t see any proof right now you must believe sometimes you must believe first before you can see

create memories to last more than one lifetime

without faith it is impossible for you to become great

im very blessed to be where im at today i get to show kids that they dont have to be stereotypes and judged i want to be the role model i never had and i hope one day my followers will help me be that

like the tortoise stick your neck out to succeed

if you are paying someone to motivate you seriously you should rather pay to a psychiatrist

it’s just a drama we come and we go why fear why worry just enjoy the show

treat people nice because youll never know who can be your breakthrough in disguise

❄ its not just about who is real to your face its also about who stays loyal behind your back

in that moment the flare that i sent leaves him and the negative energies that you released on the earth know this and they make use of it to destroy the released potential all the masters who lived in the world dealt with it

you’re all so quick to point out what you can’t do the time has come to learn what you can

without faith where is the force of being

tears teaches a man to trust in truthful god

you may see me as the skin but i am the one that lives within

greatness and success belong to those who believe in their being

assessment is about teachers and not about students

dont wait to be rich or famous to change the planet youre doing it now

you can make people feel good with a smile or a thoughtful gesture you have that infinite power holding the door for someone can change their day kind words can change their life

the way you handle fear determines the results you have in life if you are equipped with knowledge you can overcome fear

when you smile at someone if they dont smile back then they needed your smile more than you

if eggs can grow into great creatures you can too

its not always easy however dig deep and choose to forgive forgive yourself and others to reclaim your energy

choose to be the beautiful unique you and not compare yourself with others stay in your lane and replace competitive energy with a picture of success for you

don’t dim your light because others think it’s too bright

never leave till tomorrow which you can do today

and even if you’re not here to stay i’m happy the universe allowed your soul to stop by

the best way to appreciate your job is to imagine yourself without one

im not where i need to be but thank god im not where i used to be

not always starting from a ends you in z sometimes you have to continue with aa and create any word of your own

why look at the ground when you can stare at the stars

love the one that blooms in your presence

i came to realize the what matters the most is how we live and love during our years on earth it matters not how much wealth we accumulate for the sake of wealth but we can think of wealth as an enabler to spend quality time with our beloved ones

my goal is to create a life i dont need a vacation from

practice believing in you choose you

love being you

simplicity is a gift you give to yourself

start with love then add laughter

share your voice instead of being quiet think of and share something meaningful and relevant that adds to the conversation remember you rock

try your best or choose your best its your choice

when you look back on your life what will truly matter to you

first take care of you then you can better care for those around you release your guilt and take care of you

its not whether you have the willpower its whether you are ready to choose your best

if we are better rested take care of ourselves and become a priority in our lives we can gain the internal strength to choose a healthier lifestyle

while others look at her surface a true friend searches for her depth

there are going to be people who dont like your book and that idea may stop you from writing but remember that there are people in the world who will like your story and want to hear what you have to say write for them

remember you too are a beautiful swan

being human means being flawed imperfect messy but you cant beat yourself up for that and i dont think you can beat other people up for it either

the mess in your head

the chaos in your heart

and the flames in your eyes

for you were never meant to

be loved in pieces

or even understood

you are a piece of art

and a piece of art is only meant to be admired desired and

kept away from anyone or anything that may mess with such kind of

survival is for those who are flexible they are smart enough to adapt and they never give up

if you spoke to your friends the way you speak to yourself  would you have any friends left

most people stand in the same place until it becomes dangerous to stay there then they act

exceptional people act today to write their story

i will work hard and harder as my luck is not on good terms with me i will replace it so simply

it’s amazing how something beautiful can

suddenly change the way you feel how it can

comfort you and heal you and give you peace

you dont always need a plan sometimes you just need to breathe trust let go and see what happens

another gate of success was widely open for her a reckless step led to an unexpected career sometimes that’s what we hope for after every mistake we make

if you want to succeed you have to adapt to changes not to memories

that’s kind of you it means i am not good enough

even good is not a degree you acquire naturally he replied

the cost of being wrong is less than the cost of doing nothing

do is a word of infinite actions

you have life and liberty but you have to get up off your butt to pursue your own happiness its not going to be handed to you

if you are on the right path it will always be uphill

i can talk to anyone who understands art

if you want to be successful in this world you have to follow your passion not a paycheck

always keep in mind that those you choose to surround yourself with can become a strong influence in your path

the essence of universe has three words the patience the faith and the journey for the unknown destiny

either your purpose is running your show or your process is

until your senior leaders’ calendars align with the purpose culture change isn’t happening

why have they failed to see this the night before

was it because of the darkness or was it because

of the shadows cast from his own heart

determined and stubbornly positive thats me

it was like being able to breathe again as though he has forgotten how it was like being able to believe that light still exists and because it does maybe he could still believe in hope maybe he could still find a way

believe in yourself and the world will be at your feet

i trick myself into doing things that i believe i cant do otherwise

to achieve your goals you must learn to trick yourself into doing things that you believe you cant do otherwise

you see black and white when i have millions of grey shades

some people want it to happen some wish it would happen others make it happen

progress is impossible without change and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything

ability is what you are capable of doing motivation determines what you do attitude determines how well you do it

children are not a lifelong sentence but a lifelong reward

the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones that do

happiness is not pleasure  it is victory

consistency is key pick up one rock a day one day you will look back and realize you moved a mountain

if you forget how far you have come reflect adjust the rearview mirror keep your eyes on the road ahead

never let success go to your head and never let failures go to your heart

if your ship doesn’t come in swim out to meet it

a winner is a dreamer who never gives up

love doesnt mean career money or success

it goes beyond all mundane needs to impress

you can even find your passion and your bliss

but without love theres just so much you miss

entrepreneurship is a lonely road to greatness

excuses are barriers between dreams and actions

life isn’t won and lost on the first day

be strong – be god – and keep moving never to back down no matter the circumstances

the only thing you’re entitled to in life is nothing

don’t demand respect earn it don’t expect loyalty build it

sometimes in life bad things doesnt really mean its entirely bad but it rather gives space for the right option

the glory in all achievement is a product of an unforgettable story

in life we grow within the abundance of love

the wise sees the relevance of the future within it possibilities and perseveres to ensure inheritance

despite stormy wind my hairstyle is perfect yet

the highway of atmosphere in the early morning is very pure for your soul experience the bliss

a lot of people dream and while they are busy dreaming the powerful engaged people are busy doing

nobody cares how many times you failed once you succeed and be a brand illuminating present doesnt allow folks to recall your dark past

dont tell us whos your friend and who is notfor no one in the universe can be a permanent enemy

people told henry ford he couldnt do it people told thomas edison he couldnt do it people told andrew carnegie he couldnt do it people told jesus christ he couldnt do it

they all have in common they were told they couldnt do it and they all have something else in common they all did it

feel proud of yourself

people not always recognize what we have done most of the time they just see what we havent

we meet people for two reasons to give them the opportunity to change us or to give them a chance to change themselves

love yourself in such a way you never lose yourself in any instance

you can create a healthy body a loving relationship a magnificent life and ultimately carve an ultimate you with your thoughts

get your bike go on a ride

do things that give you happiness increasing your respect in yourself

you cant motivate someone until and unless youre motivated the motivated person can help you by his successful stories while a demotivated person can motivate you his failure experience

when things are not happening as planned just stop worrying and take an unplanned break to regain yourself

life fuck me oftentimes but i never take it as rape because i enjoyed the fuck

love is the art of the unspoken word

you can cross the shore without getting wet but you cant get through life without tears

even those fallen leaves dance on the musical wind cadence

big goals provide the road map for our lives the compass that tells us we’re moving in the right direction

you can’t be the only superhero around here i can do that too – hope danielles

work hard to get what you need or accept whats coming to you after all you have no right to complain trying nothing for what you needed

rules are for suckers

life is not fully lived until you are willing to die for your dream

failure is the first success

that red leaf is so much more than an ordinary leaf it is a day in my life

and quantities are limited

whether it be a frantic monday or a draining wednesday each day is a leaf drifting down down down

it might not be a vibrant red leaf that takes my breath away but its a leaf that will never be on my tree of life again

you see when we set goals that feel safer and achievable we are caving in to our own preconceived notions of what we are capable of we’re not pushing past our comfort zone we’re just settling for status quo

even then understanding my life was nothing but an illusion individual parts put together could never account for all the factors of a lifetime or account for the mind and its different forms of consciousness

fate im bringing a tough time to you

me im waiting

fate i will fuck you once again

me ha ha do it hard than the last time if you can

me can you define yourself

fate the mighty didnt give me an identity

me how would you like to work on ones life

fate i dont have a certain way i always like to work as per ones will

destiny is not written until you accept things to happen

no one gets a free pass none of us are guaranteed a perfectly pleasant journey free of hardship struggle and pain

dont worry about anything

if something is meant for you it will come to you somehow there is nothing to worry just give it some time

if its not meant for you it will never come to you your worry never makes a sense there

but your will power is something that let the things falls for you

your will power is everything that let the things fall for you

dont worry about anything

if something is meant for you it will come to you somehow there is nothing to worry just give it some time

if its not meant for you it will never come to you your worry never makes a sense there

but your will power is something that let the things fall for you

life is all about lows and highs like a sound wave you will be bored hearing a tune with a single note modulations makes the tune beautiful ups and downs make our life crazy

what can give you everything could cost you everything

go get some work keeping yourselves busy could solve many problems

you cannot expect gratitude from people who live in the opportunistic world

there is nothing original about advising others to be original if one hasnt done anything original oneself

its more important you see a hero in you than others see a superhero in you

to be a powerful guy you should control that power and know how to use it wisely

none can predict ones real nature when everything goes in a perfect way

maturity is knowing everybody has their own persception and they are right when we see them from their perspective

if you will not say never someone else will

let your fear of regret be stronger than your fear of failure

when we set goals that feel safe and achievable we are caving in to our own preconceived notions of what we are capable of

a few lionhearts must sacrifice their life forgetting fame fun and fortune so that the rest of humanity can live

always strive to do the right thing even when it isn’t a popular choice by doing so you become a better person

always seek the light even in the darkest atmospheres… that’s how we become victorious

you get what you focus on in life

try not to waste energy worrying if others get you as long as you get yourself that’s all that matters

like anything in life spending time around good things will eventually make us good being around inspiring things leads to inspiration and so on be the artist of your own picture and make it a masterpiece

evil mind leads to evil action

you and only you are responsible for your happiness

let your dream become a goal break it down into tiny pieces and that becomes your plan of action now go do it and your dream becomes your reality

the world is always brimful with love just venture it

with inner strength the soul can be still in the storm

lack of self control leads to sin

we must give freedom to our soul to fly every single day of our life

or there will come a day when we will completely forget that we have wings

observation is awakening to revelation of life

dont be a cowfly up your young life

courage doesn’t mean we are never scared courage is action in the face of fear

the world doesn’t stop and neither will we

not yetim not done yet

everyone is mad for something i am mad for everyone

why doesnt something extraordinary happen to me because darling you are the extraordinary that happened to the world

it’s an act of courage whenever you make the decision to accept responsibility for every choice and decision you make

when you take ownership you don’t have to worry about what happens to you or how other people might treat you or what obstacles might come your way because ultimately you are in control

fear is a funny thing the very instinct designed to protect us also holds us back

you dont need to know everything you just need to know yourself

remember you will on no occasion be criticised by somebody who is doing more than you you will only be criticised by someone doing far less or nothing or unable to reach what you are achieving

whatever your calling its already rooted within you and those roots can be trampled or tugged at but never removed they grow stronger only when tended nurtured and most important shared with others

wherever you are make sure you’re there

when the vision of your dreams gets blurry remember to readjust your lens

i pretend im not afraid all the time he said

trust yourself you know more than you think you do

be strong

be brave

be true

a man is only as weak as his doubts weigh him down

i believe that life holds a specific purpose for you and the most important thing you can do is find it

destination seems to be far for the ones who dream big rather than the ones who stood firm and obstinate for their passion

a bird sitting on a tree is never afraid of any breakage in the branches as because he keeps the trust on his wings rather than on the branches stay alert and always believe in yourself

if you forget how far youve come reflect adjust the rearview mirror keep your eyes on the road ahead

there is never only pain

if you change your perspective youll change your path

choice is thicker than blood

i am the brilliant idiot who can answer almost anything except what my soul wants to ask me

the love for your pack is the main reason that moves the world forward

time is a trained healer

the key to success is to align passion with purpose then make your goals to achieve your purpose

all girls are beautiful if you do not see it you are not looking at what matters most  the heart

when god gives you a mountain of struggles to climb it’s because he wants you to see the view from the top

the future is a blank canvas  rise up and salute the sun

being encourages in pain

they are inked all over my skin

the words i wish that i could have said

the things i wish that i could have changed

the wounds the scars the struggles and all the names of those who once did me wrong

the way i have it all written on my body has strengthened that soul of mine within

it makes me unstoppable and much more proud of my journey how far i’ve become and of the woman i grew up to be…

fear is not weakness it reminds us that we are human—with limitations we are not gods but instead of hiding our fear what if we faced it for in facing what makes us afraid we become stronger

when things dont go according to plan plan according to how things go

dear god mommy is going through a really hard time i see the way shes given up i know you can change everything around for her i just know it

be wise and break the silent treatment before it break down your relationship beyond repair pride repels love ask the devil he will tell you

whenever you believe yourself learned you dont learn anymore

be somebody who is very hard to replace

activate the reset button in your life  clear out old things taking space that dont meet the requirements of your internal hard drive

do you know why i talk less

just because when i say a word i make sure that its heavy enough

a person cannot get through the fog in front of him if first he does not get past the fog he sees when he looks inside him

if you fail to build you the company you used you to sell its products or services will definitely drop you when your value has diminished and nothing will remain of you except youve built more values into you

find someone who knows you are not perfect but treats you like you are

dont start your day with the broken pieces of yesterday every morning we wake up is the first day of the rest of our life

why do we always find men at work signs and not women

because our ladybosses are always at work regardless of what their job is

no they dont need coat of arms around them

if you are unsure which age group to write for start with the story thats burning within

if you cant start today you wont begin tomorrow

be the best of your being

every mistake is a stepping stone to build well your soul

if we do not know our biblical history we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes generation after generation

our world may not be the world we look forward to some days and thats okay there is tomorrow and tomorrow is a new world

most entrepreneurs have to go to hell before finding heaven

sadness can block out the light so you have to be faster for the light and if darkness catches up just keep running

if sadness blocks out the light you just got to run faster to the light and if sadness catches up just keep going

dust settle not humans

its only seeds sown today that can be harvested tomorrow

the second level is safety and security home a sanctuary a safe place

like not being shot at or having lions attack you they hadnt had much of level two either even kakuma hadnt been safe a refugee camp couldnt feel like home

the third level is social a sense of belonging

since theyd been together they must have felt like they belonged but perhaps not on a larger scale having been displaced from home and living in someone elses country

once a person has food shelter family and friends they can advance to the fourth level which is ego selfesteem

happiness hard to define yet obvious when present most of us struggled our entire lives to achieve it perhaps what had brought some of us to a mentoring class that night

the more time you spend judging others the less time you spend building your dream

worrying is an inkblot over lifes wonderful itinerary

and the moon said to me  my darling daughter you do not have to be whole in order to shine

go as far as you can see when you get there youll be able to see farther

it is better to explore a gainful uncertainty than to sit in a painful certainty

courage is lifes only measure

too tired of living under the same sky with their old faces

so sick of being in the same room with their echoing voices

they made my soul heavy as much as they corrupted my mind

they forced me to see my world in their colors as if i were a colorblind

a walking dead is what they made of me but i cannot take this anymore

i’ll find my way back home to the old me

to the beautiful dreamy little girl i’ve been before…

success is the achievement of the goals and the dreams that satisfy your inner self

every man has the ability to wheel into existence his own success

failure when taken constructively is a great source of selfknowledge  i love myself

let us do better

the goal of life should be to die with your memories not your dreams

god doesnt always gives us what we want

he always gives us what is good for us

dont beeg for the respect unless you have the ability of achieving it

there are no trips to your past that are free

theres nothing called best theres always room for better

all hypotheses are worth exploring even the crazy ones

never mind just trust the process

how do you determine if a man is successful is it by the assets he currently owns or his abilities to wheel into existence everything he does not own

i’ve given up on many things through my life

one life itself

but never on myself…

nothing is easy but who wants nothing

embrace the importance of curiosity certainty is the opposite of growth dont live life as if you have everything figured out read be curious and always be open to change — because after all where has your current thought process gotten you

we live in a real life comic book  good vs evil the enemy who we focus on makes a difference in our daily actions and words

the enemys agenda is to build a vicious cycle of confused people who infect society with its evil ways ultimately destroying lives

we only have  choices in life and what we choose matters here now and in the next life

the holy bible is the sustainable solution to all problems

everyone deserves to live out their best life the practical and most cost effective way to accomplish anything in life is to focus and study the name of jesus

awareness is an awakened state of mind that shows us what we need to see in order to conduct our lives free from emotional pain and suffering

awareness is required for no two people are the same no two interactions are going to be the same therefore you have to be in tune with what is going on moment to moment

we often forget that as human beings it is in our nature to give and create so step out of your comfort zone and changing your mindset do what we do best and connect

we must free ourselves from this prison that restricts our personal desires by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty

take time to feed your soul and keep the mindbodyspirit connection strong

in a world full of people what could be more beautiful than knowing how to form healthy relationships and establish deeper connections with those around us

fear and uncertainty are often the first steps on the road towards personal growth

only when we become truly aware on all levels of awareness within ourselves will we find we can build heart to heart connections with others after all you cannot receive what you cannot give

changing your ego to eating for other people and their worth is a simple change that will make a whole lot of difference and an immense impact on the world

i want to be in the presence of honest beings creative beings seeing beings healing beings learning beings beautiful beings

nothing is impossible there are just some things we havent achieved yet

impossibility is a state of mind not a destination

what you think believe and do makes all the difference

most of the beautiful things in the world are done effortlessly

like a tree you will experience high winds and hard rains but know that you are built for it give your storms names become

ideally no one is ‘wrong’ in their own perception they only need the opportunity to explain themselves and help us in our effort to understand their perception we need to take the interest to know why they see the reality the way they do

all achievements – all feats of excellence rise from the protoplasmic realm of the brain

dear dreams dont disturb delightfully disturb

if youre addicted enough to your passion youll surely somehow find time and paths to follow it

times i failed in vain

in next attempt i won and

unlocked the chain

then flew above the clouds

finally clutched success and felt pity on pain

the efforts would always be successful where the two floors would like to be one

if you are the drama i would like to be your script for life

if there were no suffering man would not know his limitations would not know himself

never give up and be confident in what you do there may be tough times but the difficulties which you face will make you more determined to achieve your objectives and to win against all the odds

i will keep falling deep down into my abyss

until my chaos turns it into an art scene

to get out of depression you need to find your exotic connection

walk barefoot on your dogma…

art is a journey into your existential fairytale

when you learn to let go of what you hold so close to your heart yet keep sending unconditional love its way you must know that you have mastered the art of living

you too can observe the beauty of flowers and nature through the windows of your life if you are willing to open them

try and remember what you said youd do and why you said youd do it

forget what you think other people want the thing you said youd do to be

the thing you said youd do should only be what you want the thing you said youd do to be

if the thing you said youd do makes other people happy thats great but dont say things or do things just to make them happy

find new ways to do the thing you said youd do that dont change the meaning of what you said youd do

have the purest of intentions for what you said youd do and do it bravely

if the thing you said youd do becomes successful continue to act and think like it is unsuccessful otherwise youll spend your time worrying that it might become unsuccessful

if you said youd involve people in the thing you said youd do listen to them when they say what they think you should do

if you said youd do the thing you said youd do alone then go boldly into the wilderness and make your own soul be company enough while you do the thing you said youd do

do right by the thing you said youd do tend to it and love it

by trying to remember what you said youd do and the reason why you said youd do it

all it takes is one cheat to be distrusted

all it takes is one bad word to be excluded

all it takes is one heartbreaking to be hated

all it takes is one breath to be alive

all it takes is one steal to be cast out

all it takes is one last push to be winner

all it takes is one gossip to be whisperer

all it takes is one espionage to be backstabber

all it takes is one nice word to be included

all it takes is one thank you to be appreciated

all it takes is one lousy comment to be ignorant

all it takes is one severe error to be failure

all it takes is one misbehavior to be labeled

all it takes is one slaying to be evil

all it takes is one smile to be welcome

all it takes is one giving in to be surrendered for life

people are fragile the planet can look after itself

because now i see that being different is something to be proud of and something that can lead to a sensational life

shouldnt we be trying to change the things that are making us anxious instead of trying to learn how to cope

you may have all the knowledge one can possibly acquire but it is useless unless it is molded and transformed by the power of imagination

i need more of love from the nature to heal me than any religious discourses or spiritual practices

don’t let negative thoughts of the past or the future ruin your today

i no more count my wasted tears

nor can i hear the echo of their fall

no more do i mourn my lonely years

this hour is blessed and this is certainly my call

don’t live by quantity live by quality

inside of you there is the power to change your world

without gratitude we can’t appreciate all the gifts that life gives us every day

mercifulness compassion and benefaction are the elements exist only in a brave

most of us have fallen into the idea of living an expensive

life on an empty bank account all in the name of fitting in and going with the flow – wake up

sometimes the reality of life is so clear and innocent that you want to slap yourself as hard as you can because how many tons of absurd and complex definitions you had been carrying all along about it

the biggest delusion of human is when he declares he has learnt and the realization of that very delusion is when he corrects and says that  yes he is still learning

time never waits for you so reach before to ring it

selfrespect starts with selfcare

do more of what makes your soul happy

give birth to compassion in your relations all else unbidden will come along

dont be pushed by your problemsbe led by your dreams believe in you

dream well because dreams are always the path to make the best of what we have in this world called  the life

in this life ive accepted the hand ive been dealt but that dont mean i wont try and steal a few extra cards

in order to fail you must try first

be the person you want to be not the person other people want you to be

read what you can and read all you can without keeping a record of how many books you have read or how little time is left

if you feel inferior all the time this means that you regularly let people say and do to you whatever they feel like

if you want to live an effortless life believe me you will not live you will just exist because living in the true sense requires you to put constant efforts day in day out

if your plans are failing search your motives when you do things for the wrong reasons do not expect god to back you up

the key to a good life is not giving a f about more its giving a f about less giving a f about only what is true and immediate and important

i look at the stars again daddy says he named me starr because i was his light in the darkness i need some light in my own darkness right about now

there are only so many times you can roll a dice before it lands on a six

evil is a word used by the ignorant and the weak the dark side is about survival its about unleashing your inner power it glorifies the strength of the individual

you must be hard on yourself and know when it’s time to quit but you must be even more relentless when it comes to staying on the job and push through if that is what the situation is demanding

trust your inner judgment be prepared to work for what you know is right but avoid the insufferable tragedies of running with the infectious and you will have invaluable tools at your disposal for the rest of your life

you must learn how to separate a detrimental situation from which you must burn all the bridges from when you must partake in hard work that will provide you with desirable results where you must persevere in pushing through to the end

awakening is the greatest acceptance of nature

life is good but living in fear is not my idea of living

struggle to struggle is to live and the fiercer the struggle the intenser the life then you will have lived and a few hours of such life are worth years spent vegetating

you may have invaded my mind and my body but theres one thing a saiyan always keeps his pride

always maintain a steady eye on what you know is yours for the taking and plot with all the energy you can muster to reach it

remove the mask you think others want to see instead let them see your true authentic self

its really amazing how things will fall into place when you maintain a positive attitude

there is no strength like being saved from the wages of sins

there is no freedom like forgiveness

even a low class warrior can surpass an elite with enough hard work

belief in a friendly universe is a good thing to start with

if you want to change the world

firstlyyou will have to change yourself

like a tree let your roots ground you while your branches grow in many different directions with every new experience

if you have a philosophical inclination inside you  you always feel that you observe the minute details of life then be ready to live a challenging life

there are only two valor essential to achieve the infinite knowledge first is devotion and second is continuousness

we should have more reasons to smile than to cry you will be surprised even the saddest things could result in something to smile about

life is not a problem were called to solve but a reality we need to experience and enjoy

do not be harden by hardships

if you can plan ahead into the future you will also be able to detach yourself from minor difficulties today

or even half as

get off the paved path

it’s way too basic for you

there’s air to breathe

oceans to float in

dances to be danced

songs to sing

splendor to behold

you don’t need to be

rescued or saved you

just need spaces that

allow you to expand

and rebuild

what you believe about your strengths weaknesses knowledge and skills is what you transmit to the outside world

you only have so much energy each day are you spending your time wisely are you spending your time in a useful way for your life your time is a valuable asset use it as such

it’s okay to be messy like

sunflowers galaxies and

fingerprints your life is an

your wrinkles bumps and

bruises show the world

you are a force of nature

forget linear when you

embrace chaos it brings

its own kind of order

the reoccurring thoughts of leaving are the signs that will let you know it is time to quit and find prosperity somewhere else

snuggle up to antiquated

ideas we shut our eyes

unlearn and relearn

and wands don’t buy into

the belief that you don’t

what if the theories in

psychology that dominate

our mainstream culture

are flawed rather than the

people they diagnose

that we close our eyes

to modern brain science

and global context and

as normal or abnormal

is one of the biggest

shams of the century

and impossible to sustain

knowing how to translate

conscientiousness into

something beyond the

toward a we mindset is the

best move you can make

our old methods of excavating

us with more problems

the positions we hold

the questions we ask and

the answers we’re willing

to accept when we only

mine for weaknesses that’s

exactly what we’ll find

being real is the power

skill of the century

but we’re taught to be

otherwise in the places

that should hold it most

sacred our families

human beings not

is about impact not

performance is the

most badass kind of

clarity you can have

an action by itself is insignificant but an action repeated every day is lifechanging

the more i looked forward for hope

the more patience i received

writing is the mirror in which i see myself most clearly

the true marker of

learning is turning up

with more questions

than answers

people’s judgments criticisms and power games won’t hit you as hard when your plan is greater than the assault
