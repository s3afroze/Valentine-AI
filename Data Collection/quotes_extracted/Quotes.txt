the meek may inherit the earth but at the moment it belongs to the conceited like me

did you know that i told you so has a brotherjacob she asked cutting me off his name is shut the hell up

all id ever wanted was to forget but even when i thought i had pieces had kept emerging like bits of wood floating up to the surface that only hint at the shipwreck below

and perhaps it is the greater grief after all to be left on earth when another is gone

quotation n the act of repeating erroneously the words of another

a quotation is a handy thing to have about saving one the trouble of thinking for oneself always a laborious business

she was a beautiful dreamer the kind of girl who kept her head in the clouds loved above the stars and left regret beneath the earth she walked on

i hate quotations tell me what you know

to conquer frustration one must remain intensely focused on the outcome not the obstacles

my feelings are too loud for words and too shy for the world

it is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations

in quoting others we cite ourselves

people who do a job that claims to be creative have to be alone to recharge their batteries you can’t live  hours a day in the spotlight and remain creative for people like me solitude is a victory

see the world as it is not as you wish it would be

death is the easy part the hard part is living and knowing you could be so much more then you’re willing to be

i love quotations because it is a joy to find thoughts one might have beautifully expressed with much authority by someone recognized wiser than oneself

don’t let mental blocks control you set yourself free confront your fear and turn the mental blocks into building blocks

mathematics expresses values that reflect the cosmos including orderliness balance harmony logic and abstract beauty

your memory feels like home to me

so whenever my mind wanders it always finds it’s way back to you

…the sad part is that i will probably end up loving you without you for much longer than i loved you when i knew you

some people might find that strange

but the truth of it is that the amount of love you feel for someone and the impact they have on you as a person is in no way relative to the amount of time you have known them

there is an ocean of silence between us… and i am drowning in it

create your own style… let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others

it is beautiful it is endless it is full and yet seems empty it hurts us

the sky is not my limiti am

sometimes to selfdiscover you must selfdestruct

a tamed woman will never leave her mark in the world

it’s always about timing if it’s too soon no one understands if it’s too late everyone’s forgotten

i think it’s beautiful

the way you sparkle

when you talk about

the things you love

somewhere along the way we all go a bit mad so burn let go and dive into the horror because maybe it’s the chaos which helps us find where we belong

the magic that occurs

when you give a person

to just be themselves

i’m very much down to earth just not this earth

the best kind of humans are the ones who stay

two seconds later the sound of an alarm filled my ears

what did you do i said over the noise as he backed up towards the bathroom door

the girl who gave you the note

i caught her staring at my lighter

i blinked you gave a child in a psych ward  a lighter

his eyes crinkled at the corners she seemed trustworthy

youre sick i said but smiled

hey nobodys perfect  noah smiled back

to err is human to purr is feline

we swallowed the chaos because we knew we didnt want to be ordinary

if you cannot hold me in your arms then hold my memory in high regard

and if i cannot be in your life then at least let me live in your heart

and he

im restless things are calling me away my hair is being pulled by the stars again

but she was

much more afraid

you can learn every language and read every word ever written – but you’ll never find what’s in your heart

how can you

he has it

madness and chaos are selfdestructing but over thinking is the suicide

quiet people have the loudest minds

there is nothing

prettier in the

than a girl

with every breath she takes

i had someone once who made every day mean something

and now… i am lost…

and nothing means anything anymore

it was her chaos that made her beautiful

i think perhaps i will always hold a candle for you – even until it burns my hand

and when the light has long since gone … i will be there in the darkness holding what remains quite simply because i cannot let go

i worry there is something broken in our generation

there are too many sad eyes on happy faces

when you experience loss people say you’ll move through the  stages of grief…

she was broken i think it’s because she loved too much and she was always blind to the fact that love too is sometimes broken

if i lived a million lives i wouldve felt a million feelings and i still wouldve fallen a million times for you

i want to be with someone who dreams of doing everything in life

and nothing on rainy sunday afternoons

it’s funny for all it took was a broken heart and that alone was enough enough for her to do everything she ever dreamed of

love me when i least deserve it because thats when i really need it

depression is being colorblind and constantly told how colorful the world is

appreciate the moment of a first kiss it may be the last time you own your heart

the truth is i didn’t need therapy i just needed to feel loved and know that someone out there craved my attention

suddenly everything was beautiful the way she viewed the world was nothing more but a reflection of herself

society will always be too fragile to accept us for all that makes us beautiful

some of them quite

exotic and far away

but i always returned to myself

wherever i go i meet myself

i had to learn to live without you and i couldnt make sense of it because i left so much of me inside of you

to be human is to be broken and broken is its own kind of beautiful

though these words will never find you i hope that you knew i was thinking of you today… and that i was wishing you every happiness

the girl you loved once

he was both everything i could ever want…

and nothing i could ever have…

plants are more courageous than almost all human beings an orange tree would rather die than produce lemons whereas instead of dying the average person would rather be someone they are not

my god he gasped youre fun to kiss

nonjudgment quiets the internal dialogue and this opens once again the doorway to creativity

shes an old soul with young eyes a vintage heart and a beautiful mind

there is another alphabet whispering from every leaf singing from every river shimmering from every sky

the woman is the most perfect doll that i have dressed with delight and admiration

we need houses as we need clothes architecture stimulates fashion it’s like hunger and thirst — you need them both

i want everyone to wear what they want and mix it in their own way that to me is what is modern

what good are wings without the courage to fly

chase your stars fool life is short

that was her magic—

she could still see

the sunset

even on those

maybe i hope too much maybe i dream too much or maybe i love too much to just give up on you

brushing a girl’s hair

once a day

will solve more problems

than all those

and drugs

love too was just a question of time

i was never really certain why he scared the bejesus out of me nothing scared me growing up i’ve been playing with dead people since the day i was born so it’s good thing yet the big bad scared me which brings me to the reason i called

which was to give me nightmares for the rest of my life

to our very last

the best part was

pulling down the

stuffing the doorbell

you are not what you are

you are darkness

the most complicated skill is to be simple

but dear don’t be afraid of love it’s only magic

love her but leave her wild

luxury is the ease of a tshirt in a very expensive dress

love knows no limit to its endurance no end to its trust no fading of its hope it can outlast anything love still stands when all else has fallen

i raised you so high that every other man on earth is now doomed to live in your shadow

because i knew she could do better

and now shes gone

if i shouldve

just been better

time is all we have and don’t

fashion and music are the same because music express its period too

love what is simple and beautiful

these are the essentials

she will blaze through you like a gypsy wildfire igniting you soul and dancing in its flames and when she is gone the smell of her smoke will be the only thing left to soothe you

since there is no real silence

silence will contain all the sounds

all the words all the languages

all knowledge all memory

i need you because i know i deserve you but let me fall in love with you one last time before i let go so i can remember the beautiful imperfection that rattled my bones

it was never the way she looked

always the way she was

i would have fallen in love with her

with my eyes closed

i have seen your

and brightest days

and i want you to know

that i will be here

i just loved you because you’re you

thinking of you is a poison i drink often

she was another broken doll dreaming of a boy with glue

thats the problem with best friends sometimes they know you better than you know yourself

it’s painful loving someone from afar

watching them – from the outside

we’re not that lucky

have you noticed that you’re breathing

look around and count your blessings

so when you’re sick of all this stressin’ and guessin’

love is not for everyone theres a certain kind of courage in allowing yourself to fall

the greatest tragedy of life is we overestimate and overvalue the opinions of the world while underestimate and undervalue of our own

think about your future in a positive way and you will move towards your goals

kindness indicates the act is done with love

most people will choose to change you for telling the truth about their bad ways instead of choosing to change their bad ways they forget that the truth doesn’t hurt them as much as the bad things they do

to remind it of its real beloved

so it settles for that candle in reach

revels in its heat and asks to be burned

to all the loving  caring

self love is more important than any love if you don’t love yourself it becomes difficult for your partner to love you too

if we can move from the mentality where  when you are white you are right to where you right you are right

there is a prison that holds us within it it is a prison of the mind and yet not truly of the mind for it is an illusion lest we not forget that consciousness and not the mind is the true architect of our existence

when you leave your wellbeing under the responsibility of another person the result will never be ideal because the only one able to take care of you very well is yourself

there is a knowing inside you it’s an ancient truth as old as time and i hope that it jolts you wideawake

by choosing to suppress your feelings you are creating depression for yourself

the moments spent with the beloved are

why today there is a loneliness

be with someone who will love you wildly and fiercely that fierce type love behind closed doors and most of all when the doors are wide open

drowning in silence for in silence i shall never be disappointed …

jealous  when others are harvesting

when you care you don’t have to be pushed or whatever you fulfill your vision it’s that simple it doesn’t even feel like work it’s easy too easy remember that

fake people can be silenced with truth

courageous people begin the journey knowing only the destination

sweet death as like sleep when it calls for a journey on its elated wings of oblivionan oft and quietan escape from these worldsthat convey a harmless comfort with its concord dreams aloft

the reformer’s striving attempts that brought the fire to the world was resisted and put to sufferlike prometheuswhile zeus ceased him to capture his spirits of eternally replenished liver

don’t ride with someone until the wheels fall off — it’s called maintenance —

intuition is like a compass that guides your decisionmaking process when answers are not readily available

when your heart cries because it wants to be free

but your mind feels as though it is stuck in cement

this is the reality of those who suffer depression and mental health issues

when your heart cries because it wants to be free

but your mind feels as though it is stuck in concrete

this is the reality of those who suffer depression and mental health issues

one does not hold their breath and say that they are breathing

just the same

one cannot advance in life and remain the same

old situations will emerge just to test you don’t go backwards don’t do it move forwards stay moving stay true to you

i lost a few who are real special i lost someone i couldn’t even say good bye to so know this and know this well — we are here to experience life not own anyone

children who need the most love — will show it in the most unloving of ways

when someone wants you and only you

they’ll apply mad pressure

— if not you’re just something to do

successful people dream and act on it while unsuccessful people only dream

remember and honor our mothers always in the spiritual and physical realms

embrace who you are that is where your power lays

i trust those with discipline much more than i trust those with motivation to get the job done

motivation often times shows an expiration date those with true discipline have the endurance the dedication and the problem solving skills to make things happen

its either you choose to quit now and struggle for the rest of your life or you choose to struggle now make all the sacrifices and be happy for the rest of your life

the mission i’m on is way too personal it’s a soul mission i owe myself this come up

storytelling is about exploring the nuances of life the anguish within beauty and the wisdom within pain when we hold our stories inside they weigh us down when we release them we find not only voice but perspective

nothing is difficult it’s just that you don’t understand it or understand how it is done just give yourself time to understand it give yourself time to learn it you will see how easy it can be

take the time to vet the source before you make it a resource

the influx of fake authority false answers and fabricated tips sprinkled with only motivation and inspiration has been leading too many entrepreneurs start ups  beginners down some of the worst roads possible

… on questioning why she looked so sad she would remark my life has been full of terrible misfortunes most of which never happened

bullshit the only thing it is good for is fertilizing the garden remember that

a powerful force of women does not have a race or religion we are human—a powerful human force

don’t be afraid to step out enjoy and be free from everyone’s worries it is time to live for yourself without guilt or baggage smell the fresh air of freedom you deserve it

take the needle off the record that keeps playing the same song a full range of potential is headed your way with new discoveries that are going to take you places you only dreamt of

you’re in the process of learning who you are and you are loving every step you’ve moved past needing the approval of others the counterfeit emotions you once had from their judgment has burned away in the fire

you are the author of your story you are the narrative and you choose to live and enjoy life

your life as a trailblazer begins at the limit of your comfort zone

no you are not perfect what’s important is that you know your selfworth and you are happy and that’s all that matters you now know that you should never underestimate your ability to create your own happiness

loving yourself first is the foundation that you should never take for granted

we are trailblazers

our shero’s used their brains to spark the flame

we as women have to learn we cannot always do everything alone coming together as one produces greatness as we lay the foundation together

all women are trailblazers who’ve put in the work and as we all know nothing comes easy therefore the time and hard work we’ve invested is ours that we earned because it most definitely wasn’t given

trailblazers we must own our lives filter out what doesn’t serve us and stand firm for what we believe in

our voices are beautiful and powerful

groundbreaker stomp the ground and make your mark

trailblazer you are a warrior

our pioneers and trailblazers who dared to make the journey into the unknown have given us the courage to break out of our comfort zone to dare to be unique magnificent phenomenal and have set ideals to stand for the power of truth

our minds are creative and knowledgeable

we need to lift each other up more reach down to lend a helping hand reach up and tell your sisters of all races and religions i am here for you

our minds are creative and knowledgeable

when a woman is independent that’s also a huge issue i have noticed that an independent woman is spoken down to because she is fearless free and she would rather walk alone because she knows her worth ladies there is nothing wrong with that

discipline is key when you’re working on selffulfillment therefore you must stay on course success is an ‘inside job’ because it starts with working on yourself first before you can reap any benefits

go ahead blame the women we are holding up the peace sign smiling and laughing feeling good as we press forward

we are free and feel refreshed it feels good to be the last ones standing we look at life totally differently and we now see that it’s okay to be a little rough around the edges

the dots are now connecting you feel alive

you know now that all is not lost now that you’ve cut the cord it is time give your heart a second chance at loving yourself

silence your mind take a deep breath and close your eyes as you open your eyes look at your reflection in the mirror aren’t you beautiful queen embrace who you are smile laugh welcome the new you and say my world is just now beginning

you’ve lost a lot but you’ve gained closure you are now balanced centered focused and filled with peace surrounding you in your heart mind body and soul

your pride was hurt but you would rather walk alone and be more willing to give and learn more about the queen you are

you might not see it now but you are stronger than you can ever imagine

you are a queen as a matter of fact you are the queen act as if you know it

you are powerful determined strong and you can make the biggest and most extravagant move and put it into action

lights camera strike a pose and own it

it is yours to own

queen you are powerful act like you know it

no more brainwashing—expect the unexpected to blow your mind connect with yourself and your life’s purpose—then grow

losing yourself is scary

a young lady is taught to never fuss or complain and to always keep a smile on her face when a young lady speaks her mind she is labeled as being impolite and is told to be cautious and mindful of what she says something to think about

the ripple effect is change eventually the rings of the ripples change they either become smaller or wider in length no matter the size sooner or later the ripple will vanish but the question is—did it leave an effect or was it pointless

what impact does the ripple effect have on you will you reach for great heights or will you let the ripple effect’s purpose pass you by

a young lady is taught to never fuss or complain and to always keep a smile on her face when a young lady speaks her mind she is told that she is not acting ladylike

when a young lady steps out of her comfort zone to challenge herself to fight for what she wants she is told she is not acting ladylike

when a young lady plays a sport and at times she may be aggressive she is told that she is not acting ladylike

when a young lady is bossy she is told to humble herself because that is not acting ladylike maybe she isn’t bossy maybe she is confident within herself has high selfesteem and knows she can dare to be different

when a young lady no longer plays with baby dolls or toy kitchens and she’s trying to find where she fits in today’s society she is told she needs to learn how to cook clean wash and provide for her husband and family why is that so

i decided to choose

no more sadness because of how someone else will feel

no more hiding my feelings

no more avoiding the truth of how i felt

no more unresolved situations

no more letting people rob me of my happiness and joy and letting life pass me by

no more misery and selling myself short

no more letting people take and steal my inner peace

no more giving a shit about what other people think of me—they are going to form their opinion anyway—and the question is who cares not me that’s the least of my worries

no more giving everyone the best of me it is time for me to fall in love with myself and give myself all of me

instead of being groomed for her future husband andor career a young lady should be first taught to love herself i am a firm believer that if you put yourself first and find out who you are as a person everything else will fall into place

sadly that is not what a young lady is taught

most importantly a little girl should be taught that she should love herself first flaws thorns and all however she’s been raised as a rose without knowing how to handle the pricks from the thorns she’s left alone to learn how to heal

this is your moment you are coming into a time of peace and fulfillment take it all in you put up with a lot of people’s shit to get where you are today

everything has changed and life has taken a turn for the worse side effects are making you sick sick of life sick of struggling

when the side effects knock you down find the strength to get up because you are a soldier you’ve paid your dues and nobody can hurt you because your foundation is solid

you look at your life and ask why are they so jealous i do not have anything they want oh yes ma’am you have everything they want and it starts with who you are as a person they want to be you

they want your strength

they want your courage

they want your confidence

they want your stride

and they want your joy

don’t bury yourself in broken dreams of resentment expand your life purpose and reap the benefit of happiness

the side effects’ time has expired it is time to put an end once and for all to carrying everyone’s dirty load leave them where they lie let them figure out their own messes and bad decisions

take a breather and let it go i bet the load is so much lighter

not only do you carry the side effects of others but their side effects are contagious this affects you mentally to the point where you lose yourself in the process of trying to fix a situation or a person that is beyond repair

you find yourself helping others who solely depend on you for their mental state and their ability to think for themselves foolishly you do not see how often you carry their burdens their side effects begin to poison your life

another one bites the dust i am reaping the benefit of selffulfillment and selfcontrol i am worthy of all the good things in life

take the healing that is being offered untangle your fears confidence and perseverance are your purpose

dear fallen warrior you will not fall apart not all wars are meant to have weapons your armor is your mind peace happiness drive–and your life you are powerful you are unique you are a warrior because you are the chosen one

fallen warrior i know you have given everything you’ve got and you feel like you have nothing left to give

fallen warrior i know it’s been a while since you smiled

fallen warrior i see that you are hurting and i feel your pain

fallen warrior this is not the end this is the start of your new beginning

fallen warrior do not doubt my or your abilities you have more going for you than you have going against you

fallen warrior keep moving you have what it takes perseverance is your middle name

fallen warrior you are not the victim you are the victor

you step back because you know why you are here you know why you are alive sometimes you have to be your own shero

slowly but surely i let the happiness back into my life there were times when i psyched myself out and let happiness play peekaboo as i let despair pain hurt stress and depression back into my life

it is okay to cry survival tears in difficult times it is okay to ask questions it is hard to let go and have faith therefore you are always asking why me what did i do wrong should i have given more of this or that or what if

tell yourself i know why i am here i know why i am alive be honest with yourself and be open to how you want your life to feel feeling new refreshed and learning how to love again you deserve to smile

you rose above it all

look deep within your soul and ask yourself—no matter who it concerns—is it worth it

is it worth losing your outer and inner peace

is it worth your happiness

is it worth your sanity

if they are causing you stress let them go and cut the cord

the question that needs to be asked is—who do you love more yourself or making other people happy

as a woman it’s hard to stay grounded when every time you think you are doing something right someone wants to pull up the roots you took so long to plant

when there is a world of distractions and difficult decisions to make when a woman finds herself straying off the tracks she will not feel defeated

she is courageous

she is victorious

she is a pioneer

ladies it’s harvest time take care of your crops water them and weed them out

women are human just like everyone else however a woman is treated as though she’s not it is beyond ridiculous that a woman always has to justify her actions in lengthy detail in every situation and the person she encounters

a woman’s strength is unstoppable as she takes on the loads she is given in life we as women shouldn’t ever underestimate our ability we are warriors and if it wasn’t for our great strength of perseverance what would the world be like today

we have to learn how to put ourselves first we have to stop cheating ourselves by putting other people’s needs first and our needs and wants last

wake up become more aware and alive of what feeds your soul without seeking permission from others many curve balls have been thrown don’t hesitate—now is the time to hit a home run

change is like pulling the wool from your eyes and seeing the light for the first time if you are set in your old ways it takes people who care about you to help you get over as many hurdles as it takes to finish the course

there are stages in life that you must go through to find out the true value of your worth i learned that nobody knows your worth but you nobody will value you more than yourself people will treat you according to how much you can take

do you know how much can you take do you know your limits

i had to go through hell and beyond to answer both questions when i look back i ask myself who’s to blame

most importantly i learned that nobody would love me more than i love myself i am the only person who will love hard on me therefore i learned how to live in a selffulfilling mode and i wouldn’t have it any other way

when she hits the ground she will bounce right back up the road may twist and turn there will be a few steep hills and sharp curves but she will never give up because she is unstoppable

love abounds against all odds one thing about love is that it comes with many sacrifices its good intentions always reassure you that in order to love someone else you must be willing to love yourself first

life has a funny way of expressing itself i learned that during light or darkness we have to trust the path and follow directions in order to survive the transformation

a woman is a visionary she gathers great strength through the hardest challenges she suits up for the battles that are set before her and executes them without hesitation

i’m taken aback by how girls are groomed to be a certain way however boys are able to love life and live freely without limitations and criticism

the darkness taught me to trust my intuition it helped me to coordinate and bring peace within my center when i walked into the unknown the darkness helped me to know when i needed to surrender and to dissect each circumstance

love is filled with a lot of sacrifices and resentment and is underestimated in so many ways it is something of a catch and an overwhelming source of empowerment

love will open your eyes to realize you are not the victim instead you are victorious over the trials battles and challenges of life

love is a strange word it can be misleading and confusing it can break you down with tender grace and mercy while at the same time building you up to become a powerful force—and after that you will never be the same

what is love it is the essence of the unknown and will overwhelm you if you do not realize you are giving too much of yourself

what is love it is the essence of the unknown and will overwhelm you if you do not realize you are giving too much of yourself

love is an intense emotion that will take a toll on you mentally emotionally and physically in an unselfish yet bittersweet way that develops into a deep affection and sometimes an unknown outcome

i want to wake up in the world where we inspire each other rather than in the world were we kill each other

to lovers out there

there is nothing wrong in falling in love and there is nothing foolish in loving someone

when it comes to politics its not about who is corrupt its about who is been caught because they all have skeletons in the closet

people who say that they know who you are based on you from the past is akin to saying that they know who you are now based on clothing you once wore

if your enemies have nothing they can use now to bring you down or to fight you they always go for your past it doesnt matter how long it was and they would try it to make it relevant and make it as something that happen recent

gotta’ take that adventure in order to understand your journey

whatever people say there is right there is wrong there is nothing in between  hercule poirot murder on the orient express

happiness is an unrealistic goal im aiming for contentment

humans are one of the reasons why the world is exciting and the only thing that complicates it is their wrongdoings

your loved one is your best thought in all your mind throughout your whole life

my mind is a forest fire

if you have to set goals and you choose what you can do you wont break the record or make history

if you ask me a question then you say the answer does not matter you should not be worried or dispute the answer i give you

the love rush

sensation only felt by the seduced mind and body under the command of it

don’t be too ashamed or afraid

don’t be too ashamed or afraid to get any menial job while pursuing your dream job the bills still have to get paid

my consciousness is clean and new

and my conscience clear and vivid

i know what ive been giving to you

but i dont know what you received

as the river that flows freely your mind drives me to look at the cages that i have built around me

iotcoming soon in a thing near you

when her soul is on fire

her head in the clouds

and her heart on her sleeves

she is under no obligations to neither

make any sense to you

nor

to put on a different skin in order to owe your heart

love is inherently intense intensity is an aspect of love itself not a function of love’s volume

her love was like endless summer nights

i hope you fall in love with someone who treats you right

i hope you fall in love with someone who kisses your scars kisses right where it hurts and make you feel alright

i hope you fall in love with someone who knows how to make you laugh

i hope you fall in love with someone who’ll never make you question your worth or the fact that you are enough

and darling i hope you fall in love with that one who’ll let you sleep peacefully at night with no doubts that may eat you alive…

deep down in my heart

how much it’s hard for me to belong

either to someone

or to somewhere

because it has always been there in my heart the desire to make a world of my own out of everyone i meet or everyplace i go

and maybe that’s why it has never worked out for me to belong

to any place or to any other person in the whole world

but myself …

i have a love  hate relationship with things and places the same way i do with people

and i’m getting tired of this place feeling as if each corner here is asking me to leave

leave and never come back again …

but darling

you can’t keep swallowing your pride in order to feed someone else’s ego

and calling it love …

we are too busy trying to be someone else that we reject others for being themselves

men try to destroy the physical beauty of a women women try to destroy mans life career reputationdignityliving life when they fight

if men are stars then women are sky theres no marvel without either of them

its ironic but you saved me by your leaving

i see you everywhere

in the scratched mirrors

the dusty pages

the empty chairs

and in the sad songs that everyone else seems to avoid

for you did have a habit of always

breaking the things that once were whole

making hell out of homes

and leaving souls starving for the things you’ve been feeding your heart on all along …

there has always been a need for me to create with word combinations belonging only to me

everyone is like a balloon and motivation is like air in balloon the more air you have the further you can go you need someone or something to motivate you to go further in life no matter how smart rich or wise you are

some people can come everywhere and a great pleasure starts while with other persons in a place the fun just starts when they leave

among all those things i count to hate you are the only exception…

for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord

plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give

you hope and a future

even thou the lord has good plans for us

our bad behaviour and morals will get in the way

let us do good and be good every second we get

in order to get claim what the lord has instore for us

if you are really broke you can’t afford giving up if you can afford giving up then that means you are not broke

any political party that fails to fire or to get rid of its corrupt members it is highly that those members were not acting on their own capacity or interest but they were following orders from the party committee or execs

she’s like a universe of her own

like the stars misunderstood

a good intention requires the support of a good action in order to translate into a positive outcome

true love exists in multiple forms with no barriers or limitations it is just unconditional

there is nothing ordinary about being yourself

to lovers out there…

dreams dont work unless you do

the message a bit more love and grace for myself and for friends and colleagues especially the ones that have it all together so beautifully

secrets are never taken to graves the dust screams underneath our souls no six feet deep solitude will undo your actions the soil bears witness

i never used to resort to quotations very much but in these past months i have read like a convict—yes a convict that’s the word i have also realized that being good with quotations means avoiding having to think for oneself

do not take life too seriously you will never get out of it alive

true love can beat any storm no matter how rough the sea is true love sails through it

but we’ve spent a lifetime being afraid of making wrong choices that we have never had the guts to make any

we’ve wasted our days worrying about what may happen next that we’ve forgotten to enjoy what’s really happening

we’ve stayed where we should’ve left

we cared for what we had to ignore

and we’ve built many walls around ourselves to an extent that light has never found its way through our darkness

in a matter of fact our worst enemies and most monstrous demons do live inside us and they lay right in the back of our heads or in the core of our chests …

there is a quiet room inside of me

where i kept the thought of you so alive

in all of my phases that’s the only place where my soul would rather be

and that’s where i bring my dead roses back to life

in that room there is nothing to hear

but a love song of free birds

in that room there is nothing to feel

but their flipping wings flying through my chest

for this room has always been the peace that never fails to end my wars

and it will always be the reason why i’ve never looked for home in others as long as the warmest and safest home is there

helping someone is not giving them what you have it’s giving them what they need

nor the fact that my life will come to an end one day

all i’ve ever been frightened of is to be a walking dead or that one morning i may wake up with no aim to be alive

it scares the hell out of me that maybe one day i’ll lose my desire to love to dream to have hope or even to smile

i don’t fear to be dead i fear to live and not being alive…

come close  let our hearts beat like one

well be the two that became one

love is the rhythm of our night

to lovers out there…

the lick of the irish

because im a giver

for those hard to reach places

strong enough for a man but made for a woman

no ink no pink

so good itll make you ink

while the legalization of cannabis is still new and being regulated for growing packaging distribution and sales the irs is old and has many regulations for businesses that can not be ignored avoided or taken lightly

shortcut this and things can get very taxing

if you are playing in this new field

look to those with authority expertise and knowledge that can not only help you with your taxes but are also up to date with all of the rules regulations propositions amendments and shifts in this exploding industry

whether we fall in

or completely fall out

you and i will

always have a story

love grows in mysterious ways like a seed through our hearts from our souls blossoming to the world

now and then you will get stuck in life but choose to push yourself to your maximum capabilities and to your fullest potential that is how you will make it

it takes a lot of sorrows inside ones heart to make them cry break and to lose hope

but it simply takes reminiscing a happy memory to make one smile instantly

so make as many happy memories as you can

to lover out there…

never regret all the things you did for love or because of love never regret falling in love or loving someone the only regret you should have is when the person whom you love don’t see your love for them actually pity them than having regrets

poets are cut from a tender cloth that covers our world in beauty

she has always been fascinated with silence

for in silence she could sit and breathe nothing but the truth

she senses all the unexpressed feelings the unsaid words and the rotten untold stories in her chest

for in silence she embraces her solitude she puts her pieces back together and creates a world of her own where she’ll always choose to live in and simply enjoy …

the difference between the oldest and the most stupid job you do is that one is selling herself and the other is selling you

the imperfection

the perfection

to be

what you are

as you are

what doesn’t kill you doesn’t make you stronger

what breaks you doesn’t make you bolder

in a matter of fact nothing becomes stronger or better if it has been broken or shattered

because a piece of you is always going to be missing less trusting in any other soul and those heart and mind of yours will always receive some messages from your past to chain you into the darkness once again

bad times knockouts and disappointments have made no one any stronger so don’t fool yourself of thinking otherwise …

but darling when you get to finally realize your worth and sit standards to everything you allow or accept in your circle

it will be much easier for you to burn bridges turn pages and fight only for what’s worthy of your time and energy …

the bravest of whom i’ve known are those who have been through suffering disappointments and pain

but still they choose to love fearlessly give nonstop and live with hope that fills their lungs …

i think we call all be a little unwise there is always something else to learn

success is not served in a tray

to achieve it we have to make our own way

i would like to end by saying that opportunity is within

to fall down on our journey is not a sin

but our failure should not hold our steps forward

and for our dreams we should never feel awkward

i can see the devil that dances at night inside my eyes and it makes me cry because i feel so alive

the most gentle creatures in the world are sometimes the most feared

those who laugh at you for trying when you are winning will the ones who are crying don’t stop doing what you love because people are laughing at you

you cannot suffer without thinking of suffering yet you can think that you are suffering without suffering

i think we can all be a little unwise there is always something else to learn

if you think you know something choose to teach someone you will see how better you will be on it

enclosing your thought

is like enclosing a free animal

you cannot expect it to be happy

jealousy is the bitter consequence of loving someone before loving oneself

they appear within you

but they are not yours

you see them go by

but you do not create them

they are images and words of life itself

the questions are never painful

only the answers are

in life there might be situations that make you sink

it’s just to make you stronger than you think

be like mercury not like glass when you get troubles

split but join the mercury bits before it’s lost in life’s puzzles

the right words are always there if a mans sharp enough to see them

you’re not more punk because you wear leather jackets you’re not more metal because you have long hair you’re not more rock and roll because you have tattoos

i fought and fought until i lost the battle then i fought some more until i lost the war

to lovers out there…

no matter how rich or how poor you are

no matter how famous or anonymous you are

no matter how beautiful or how ugly you are

everyone deserve someone special in their lives everyone deserve to be loved by someone

english translation be brave and if you are brave enough you can cross the deepest of the oceans dont be afraid of the tidal waves tornados occur even in deserts

your brain is made to think about difficult things to help you get to a point where you understand something that you didn’t understand at first and that becomes the cream of your life the rest is boring and worthless

time is precious dont waste on matters which is not important

there are many irrational illusions make the sadness of nonsense but why the blind can see and the deaf can hear it is for one single real reason and that is the language of good sense and joy

there are many irrational illusions which make the sadness of nonsense but why the blind can see and the deaf can hear it is for one single real reason and that is the language of good sense and joy

i think i found the meaning of life and that is to have two free days in one day

the reason most of us are suffering and poor is because we are offering our services time and doing things for people for free the things they should be paying for

it’s breaking my heart the way this world is so mean to people with pure intentions and soft hearts

with time i’ve seen much cruelty towards good people that instead of being cherished they are actually being used

instead of being appreciated and valued they are being taken for granted and considered as an option or a backup plan

because whenever those ones are needed they gonna be there and their doors are always wide open

so there is no need to wonder why this world is only getting filthier and uglier since we have always been ruining everything beautiful left around

even those rare kind and loving souls in our life

but a god that did everything we thought was right and good wouldnt be the creator of the universe he would be our puppet he wouldnt be god theres more to everything than we can know

you are the combination of the  people you look up to

life has changed a lot for me the moment i’ve learnt to embrace the darkness the chaos the mess and all those things i used to curse about myself

selflove has nothing to do with neglecting your flaws or imperfections but to realize each one and be aware that despite it all you can fall in love with yourself over and over again

because you simply deserve love…

because you simply deserve love…

dream as if you were awake

live as if you were dreaming

inside of my soul they lay

one twisted devil and hundreds of angels pray

so whenever my devil sings its gloomy song through my mind

those angels gather and whisper through my heart

prayers of hope and peace that my soul rises upon the highest sky…

theres no selling in service

dreams from the bottom

nobody but nobody

can stop them

no no one

can stop them

dreams from the bottom

there are people who had been in a relationship but never loved its never too late to learn how to love someone

being desperate for something is not bad but it is when you let your desperation be overly visible

today the world is reeling under hatred corruption and many innocent lives giving up

if we as humans let go of simply one percent of our selfishness earth does have a better hope in future i believe

this world has never failed to disappoint

and it has its way to teach me that the best thing you may do is running back to yourself

make a therapy out of your favorite things

read for your favorite authors

listen to music

write love notes to yourself

and enjoy solitude between the walls of your room

the world is so cold outside so learn to enjoy the warmth of those details you have always had but never learned to appreciate …

when everything is drawn and done

people will take you seriously only if you give them the opportunity to take you seriously

dont hope for better times work towards them

we are all equal

in the need of feeling unique

in the need of love

and free to be

as we are

love is freedom to be and to let be

a man of one trade is useful to his community a man of many trades is useful to society

doubt yourself too

you will find endless possibilities

time heals they say

but it’s not true

time does not heal

there is only

the flow of thoughts

one thought alone is enough to stir a happy mind

there is no fear more true than the one that passes through the mind in the form of a mere thought

blow the words away from your pain otherwise the mind will get sick

a girl can dream can realize high

on heroines that she is mortal

and therefore fearless that sanity

supplies the ground bass to the wildest singing

that breezes made visible make the finest winds

the cricket’s tiny back as i lie

on the lawn in the dark my heart

a blue cup fallen from someone’s hands

you will be the writer of whatever you write on your life book with the pen of time

a sensual lifestyle makes most sense for my daily happiness

i do not take only the meaning of words from any quotes or sentences i also grasp its vision and scope how it is within its context and perception where and what touches its conception and description

the quotes are within its universal conception not for one but for everyone it does not matter if that approach and touch just anyone somewhere as its context

i didn’t know whether to play my lucky hand or do the right thing and not go in how did i get here again how did i end up in this spot of bother

just like the most beautiful symphonies my words are my piano keys

i am filled with conviction that the interests of humanity would be best served if the united states remained true to its traditions and kept out of entangling alliances

our bodies are of such complexity of structure the motions we perform are so numerous and involved and the external impressions on our sense organs to such a degree delicate and elusive that it is hard for the average person to grasp this fact

when you don’t forget you were once a scrappy kid from scranton and you hustle until your family is set when you’re gone

hustle like no one is awake

day or night sunrise—sunset

when the lights are on and when

the lights are off

even though we could never be it was my favorite kind of love story  the one without

a beginning or an ending

just because it didnt crack

doesnt mean it didnt break

love survived every disaster and it will again

because love is the roach of emotions

you cant kill it

speed will not take you to success but right direction will

behind every quotable quote there is an untold story

philosophy is a root of science science is a branch of a philosophical tree

the moonlight gave us courage and the fire made us rebels

sometimes we exist through hardship simply because there is no other option we live because we cannot die

to lovers out there…

flowers arent forever

neither is the pain

the wilted stem from ashes

and blossom in the rain

above a rough terrain

where the shadows of their beings

find ways to remain

displaying it on twitter

validation is the trigger

eager to please the eyes of few well go a mile or two

definition of love is only clicks away in a crowded platform that is the bible of today

surviving r kelly is surviving any person who thinks they have super authority or power and influence on others  using their career position money body in manipulating  taking advantage of others sexuality

what is life without wonder

what is experience without growth

what is inspiration without action

believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything

do not look for approval except for the consciousness of doing your best

she was sitting there in silence when i interrupted her glooming halo but she couldn’t feel my existence though

she didn’t cry she didn’t scream she didn’t even blame one single person for the shit they put her through

i didn’t deserve this ’ she said while chocking her trembling voice

and i stood there wondering how such few words could be full of so much darkness disappointment and brokenness that they ached me to the core

i wish that one day you’ll make it home

to a place you belong a person you love or a passion you may die for

where your heart is cherished

your mind sleeps in peace

and your soul is simply understood

start making your happiness a daily priority

don’t be afraid to be afraid have the courage to face fear and jump  there are lots of great things that happen when we decide to take risks

i am only afraid of dying not of being dead

i see the universe in your eyes

i’m living life in color i’m not compromising that

life is a fleeting cameo and the reason for the short season is to reason for our season

there are no stones

honeycombed into

an abusive tongue

to clip my wings

angels are flying all around us

i feel their presence in the air and in the dirt i feel that kind of protection and i’m

good no matter what is formed and

created against me

so how is it going having fun in your life how is the tuning with your new love is it similar to the level we had or is it better than ours no you can tell the truth i wont get jealous coz whats mine will always be mine internally

i dont care where you go or with whom coz when you were with me you were with me and completely mine

you know my friends still ask me if i have stopped loving you even today i fail to lie to them regarding my love towards you even today i fail to say i dont love you leave alone saying i hate you

maybe i really loved you too much that is why you left right

nobody can digest anything in excess i know nobody likes this nature of mine being over loving and caring they get the idea that i am obsessive but i am not

i dont know you dont know how to see love or feel love coz if you knew you wouldnt have abandoned me in the first place but its totally fine your call after all

some battles you fight them but the real war is within yourself

years has passed and my eager heart stands

until we meet again love is an uncertainty that ill pass

i had all but one to give this heart of mine that is yours still

quotes isnt just words on paper

its a summary of life

they’ll keep warning you from monsters that hide in the dark and demons that sleep beneath your pillow

but no one will ever warn you from the monster that bites your heart and those demons that feed on the peace of your mind

bur dear they are the most dangerous and the scariest of them all …

the game is gonna get you one day keep changing the game in time

my opinion is that a school with no playground isnt a school at all

writing and creating are a lot like making a special kind of sauce

it takes time

put the flame low

slowly stir in each

take your time

the real magic happens in the process there is only one other thing i can think of that’s like writing and creating

it’s love

come to the edge

we might fall

come to the edge

its too high

come to the edge

and they came

and he pushed

and they flew

you cant give me what you dont have when some chooses to hate hate is what they have withing themselves that is why they are able to give it

sounding intelligent with something wrong you are doing does not make it right

women would never spend their money on a man who is stranger because they are not mad but they will expect a stranger who is a man to spend on them thats being gentlemen and being a good man

life experience is like a rainbow

it has all the colors some we lovesome we dont love as much

but seen altogether its beautiful

just as some experiences we love and some we dont love so much

but seen altogether life is beautiful

people want to have your blessings

but they are not willing to serve the god

from just one candle you can light a million candles without putting strain on the first candle from one awakened being you can set light into a million souls so powerful is the light

we are this light and we must discover this

a man’s friendships are one of the best measures of his worth

writing is architectural letters become words and words become sentences and sentences become paragraphs and paragraphs become chapters and chapters become books

everybody deserves a story to read

i’d rather be wrong while doing the right

thing rather than wrong for not doing

anything at all

non of us really knew it was never about solving the mystery it was about keeping it

mute your moves

we will scrutinize the ingredients for the food we put in our body but we dont even know what the people we put in our lives are made of

philanthropy comes in all sizes but they all weigh the same

when you treat your business or dream like a living breathing baby… you’ll make better decisions and wiser choices

stop shortcutting second guessing and buying into the unproven hype

your dreams deserve more

brand before liftoff

for the best launch the farthest reach and the most results build the brand foundation and fuel it while it is still on the launching pad

designing a brand after you take off is like fueling a rocket after its lifted off

if you can dream it or imagine it then you can do it

you cant go home or at least you cant go back into your childhood home if you dont live there anymore and the door is locked

i guess it has something to do with leaving the past behind and not getting carted off by the police

why when we feel good the world seems so bright

but when we feel bad nothing round seems right

it’s as if for the world to deem alright

the way is to adjust ourselves aright

that’s the main issue ezekiel i don’t know you and you don’t know me

faith has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with belief

the owner of the science and wisdom is like a sea how much wisdom getting from him or dedicates it wont decrease from him

your eyes gaze into mine  a tender discovery of your heart speaking to mine

her love was as wild as the flames that made her she was not the one to be tamed but loved from far

you never noticed but i was right there in the spaces between all the words you wrote for him

my heart belonged to her but she never belonged to me

she belonged to her passions and her hearts desires

don’t wait for next year to plan for next year that will be too late but choose to start planning now

ive always known what i want its just that everyday its something different

being different comes at a cost make sure you are rich in courage enough to pay

reality has killed more dreams than doubt ever will

everybody and their mother has a book and a podcast these days instead of telling people to check it out like everyone else already does

give them reasons to check it out tell them what your content is about why you are sharing it and who would like it engage

every one know the series only usage of cards identify the winner

we all know sex sells but sexy does not always translate to authority be aware and beware of those only presenting the sexy imagery that entices without the skilled expertise to back it up

people are an organizations most valuable asset and the key to its success

showing off or bragging does not showcase authority or ability

sharing your knowledge and experience without trying to sell yourself sends a greater message of engagement and authenticity

doing unnecessary things waste time

doing both cause poverty

i was once swallowed in a dark shroud

of fear pain and selfloathing

which i believed i couldn’t voice

because if i spoke of my loneliness

would it not prove my uselessness

light could not break the shadows

and when i finally became so lost

i reached out in desperation

for even the smallest guidance

every tearful thought i had hidden

was exposed in all of its falsehood

depression is not the problem

it’s when we choose to conceal it

my relationship with depression

my eyes sparkle confidence my hair sways in beauty my personality takes pride in the good deeds i have done and my smile i say let that be an autograph for others to understand whom i am

my cosmic desires freeze in an apocalyptical healing

alleviate my nightmares and calm my deep thunders

to lovers out there…

drops of rain fall on my naked skin

they clean my spirit and awake my conscience

they cry with me in a cathartic release

they scream they fight they hurt they heal

excerpted from healed by rain chapter resilience

if you hear a bad news if you are exhausted and frustrated take a moment to breathe

it helps me it should help you

putting my potential to test motivating myself yet again challenging my will because i wish to be proved right to myself more importantly than proving others wrong

self appreciation is the key as they say

when you love someone truly you set them free

one touch one kiss and a leap of faith  the heart will forever be claimed

government should start hiring people who are willing to feed the nation rather than people who want to feed their stomach

without hesitating the faerie leaned in and placed a soft kiss against his cheek

what was that for he asked looking at her from the corner of his eye

i just realised i hadnt thanked you yet she said softly her voice was almost a whisper

for what

for everything lori’s large beautiful eyes gazed at him with sincerity

unexplainable is your presence making me want to become a poet to highlight your essence

the highest wealth one can attain is peace of mind amidst pieces of mind

i cannot tell it to anyone so i’m telling it to everyone

books are better than men they give you multiple orgasms even before the climax

she has always been admired by the sun

for the way she rises each time after she falls

but the way she sparkles and glows whenever she talks about the things she adores

makes the moon and stars watch in envy…

but my walls were so high for a coward to climb …

i have never been scared of the darkness not even a little bit in the dark you hear nothing but the truth you see nothing but real faces and naked souls

on the contrary i’ve always been afraid of the light where people talk about everything but never say a thing and wear a fake skin because they do know that there is an eyes watching or judging them here or there …

do not invest if you cant make it worthwhile

she is the pining of my heart

muses dont come by everyday and most of them have an expiration date

from the first cup of coffee in the morning

to playing in the sheets at night i choose you to be by my side

would you stay here with me and listen without having to leave

on your face

what did i tell you fanny about airraids not killing people here we are right as rain my bed simply went through the floor plonplon and i went on it most comfortable

by avoiding the hype and digging into the proof of concept…

to speak many words

with just a small gesture

there comes a time when you meet someone and you just want that person to be happy for the rest of their life

being in denial it’s a global problem and crisis to all human kind learn to be true to yourself that is the only way you will conquer

there was no one near to confuse me so i was forced to become original

i sit every night and i observe the stars i tell them all of my secrets and everything that pulls me down

i rest in their silence in the way they never have to reply or judge my sorrows they just listen and brighten my darkness…

what if i show you all those dark sides of my mind

what if i let you in so that you can see how messy and destructive my soul can be

would you still be there for me

to take a photograph is to learn new steps

like a toddlers first walk from start to end

it could be about anywhere anyone any moment or anything

let that sink in until your eyes see clearly

what image you cease to create to preserve in dearly

with a camera you take the picture in mind

a photographers mistake is to leave it behind

as an educator and advocate i want to be a part of encouraging and supporting movers and shakers of our world i do not want to be a part of suppressing them

i’ve searched high and low for the remedy to enter me i’ve searched high and low for the right frequency to be with me i searched high to light my mind and energy i searched low to know the dark in me

all this i did for harmony all this i did for the immortal me all this i did and found i have stardust in my shoes yellow in new orleans’ blues water on the moon and inside me the primal celestial tune
