im selfish impatient and a little insecure i make mistakes i am out of control and at times hard to handle but if you cant handle me at my worst then you sure as hell dont deserve me at my best

youve gotta dance like theres nobody watching

love like youll never be hurt

sing like theres nobody listening

and live like its heaven on earth

you know youre in love when you cant fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams

a friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you

darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that

we accept the love we think we deserve

it is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not

as he read i fell in love the way you fall asleep slowly and then all at once

the opposite of love is not hate its indifference the opposite of art is not ugliness its indifference the opposite of faith is not heresy its indifference and the opposite of life is not death its indifference

it is not a lack of love but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages

love all trust a few do wrong to none

have you ever been in love horrible isnt it it makes you so vulnerable it opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up

being deeply loved by someone gives you strength while loving someone deeply gives you courage

there is never a time or place for true love it happens accidentally in a heartbeat in a single flashing throbbing moment

love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own

you love me real or not real

i tell him real

im in love with you he said quietly

love looks not with the eyes but with the mind

and therefore is winged cupid painted blind

love is like the wind you cant see it but you can feel it

you dont love someone because theyre perfect you love them in spite of the fact that theyre not

if you can make a woman laugh you can make her do anything

we’re all a little weird and life is a little weird and when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness—and call it love—true love

there is nothing i would not do for those who are really my friends i have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature

love never dies a natural death it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of witherings of tarnishings

im selfish impatient and a little insecure i make mistakes i am out of control and at times hard to handle but if you cant handle me at my worst then you sure as hell dont deserve me at my best

youve gotta dance like theres nobody watching

if i had a flower for every time i thought of youi could walk through my garden forever

the real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or smiling into your eyes or just staring into space

dumbledore watched her fly away and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to snape and his eyes were full of tears

after all this time

when someone loves you the way they talk about you is different you feel safe and comfortable

to die will be an awfully big adventure

a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment

so its not gonna be easy its going to be really hard were gonna have to work at this everyday but i want to do that because i want you i want all of you forever everyday you and me everyday

just when you think it cant get any worse it can and just when you think it cant get any better it can

tis better to have loved and lost

than never to have loved at all

i love you as certain dark things are to be loved

in secret between the shadow and the soul

the one you love and the one who loves you are never ever the same person

some people dont understand the promises theyre making when they make them i said

right of course but you keep the promise anyway thats what love is love is keeping the promise anyway

when we love we always strive to become better than we are when we strive to become better than we are everything around us becomes better too

one is loved because one is loved no reason is needed for loving

when i despair i remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won there have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they can seem invincible but in the end they always fall think of italways

love is needing someone love is putting up with someones bad qualities because they somehow complete you

we love the things we love for what they are

i would die for you but i wont live for you

in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you

perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act just once with beauty and courage perhaps everything that frightens us is in its deepest essence something helpless that wants our love

so i love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you

i carry your heart with me i carry it in my hearti am never without it anywhere

i go you gomy dear and whatever is done by only me is your doingmy darling

i fear no fate for you are my fatemy sweeti want no world for beautiful you are my worldmy true

and its you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you

here is the deepest secret nobody knows

here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life which grows

higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide

and this is the wonder thats keeping the stars apart

i carry your heart i carry it in my heart

you are and always have been my dream

the only thing worse than a boy who hates you a boy that loves you

you are my best friend as well as my lover and i do not know which side of you i enjoy the most i treasure each side just as i have treasured our life together

im selfish impatient and a little insecure i make mistakes i am out of control and at times hard to handle but if you cant handle me at my worst then you sure as hell dont deserve me at my best

youve gotta dance like theres nobody watching

love like youll never be hurt

sing like theres nobody listening

and live like its heaven on earth

you know youre in love when you cant fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams

you are and always have been my dream

the only thing worse than a boy who hates you a boy that loves you

you are my best friend as well as my lover and i do not know which side of you i enjoy the most i treasure each side just as i have treasured our life together

never love anyone who treats you like youre ordinary

promise yourself

to be so strong that nothing

can disturb your peace of mind

to talk health happiness and prosperity

to every person you meet

to make all your friends feel

that there is something in them

to look at the sunny side of everything

and make your optimism come true

to think only the best to work only for the best

and to expect only the best

to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others

as you are about your own

to forget the mistakes of the past

and press on to the greater achievements of the future

to wear a cheerful countenance at all times

and give every living creature you meet a smile

to give so much time to the improvement of yourself

that you have no time to criticize others

to be too large for worry too noble for anger too strong for fear

and too happy to permit the presence of trouble

to think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world

not in loud words but great deeds

to live in faith that the whole world is on your side

so long as you are true to the best that is in you

i would always rather be happy than dignified

where there is love there is life

nobody has ever measured not even poets how much the heart can hold

some women choose to follow men and some women choose to follow their dreams if youre wondering which way to go remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesnt love you anymore

once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering

the best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds and thats what youve given me thats what id hoped to give you forever

hes more myself than i am whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same

every heart sings a song incomplete until another heart whispers back those who wish to sing always find a song at the touch of a lover everyone becomes a poet

doubt thou the stars are fire

doubt that the sun doth move

doubt truth to be a liar

but never doubt i love

we loved with a love that was more than love

this is a good sign having a broken heart it means we have tried for something

eleanor was right she never looked nice she looked like art and art wasnt supposed to look nice it was supposed to make you feel something

and so the lion fell in love with the lamb… he murmured i looked away hiding my eyes as i thrilled to the word

what a stupid lamb i sighed

what a sick masochistic lion

out beyond ideas of wrongdoing

and rightdoing there is a field

ill meet you there

when the soul lies down in that grass

the world is too full to talk about

a guy and a girl can be just friends but at one point or another they will fall for each othermaybe temporarily maybe at the wrong time maybe too late or maybe forever

the more i know of the world the more i am convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love i require so much

i have decided to stick to lovehate is too great a burden to bear

whats meant to be will always find a way

they say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world someone to love something to do and something to hope for

hearts are made to be broken

two people in love alone isolated from the world thats beautiful

this above all to thine own self be true

and it must follow as the night the day

thou canst not then be false to any man

for the two of us home isnt a place it is a person and we are finally home

the world is indeed full of peril and in it there are many dark places but still there is much that is fair and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief it grows perhaps the greater

they didn’t agree on much in fact they didn’t agree on anything they fought all the time and challenged each other ever day but despite their differences they had one important thing in common they were crazy about each other

you could have had anything else in the world and you asked for me

she smiled up at him filthy as he was covered in blood and dirt he was the most beautiful thing shed ever seen

but i dont want anything else in the world

love is so short forgetting is so long

the very essence of romance is uncertainty

there is always some madness in love but there is also always some reason in madness

if all else perished and he remained i should still continue to be and if all else remained and he were annihilated the universe would turn to a mighty stranger

to douchebags he said gesturing to brad and to girls that break your heart he bowed his head to me his eyes lost focus and to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her

if you remember me then i dont care if everyone else forgets

man may have discovered fire but women discovered how to play with it

what i want is to be needed what i need is to be indispensable to somebody who i need is somebody that will eat up all my free time my ego my attention somebody addicted to me a mutual addiction

my daddy said that the first time you fall in love it changes you forever and no matter how hard you try that feeling just never goes away

what i need is the dandelion in the spring the bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction the promise that life can go on no matter how bad our losses that it can be good again

and in the end

the love you take

is equal to the love you make

love doesnt just sit there like a stone it has to be made like bread remade all the time made new

love does not consist of gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction

i dont trust people who dont love themselves and tell me i love you  there is an african saying which is be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt

i am not sure exactly what heaven will be like but i know that when we die and it comes time for god to judge us he will not ask how many good things have you done in your life rather he will ask how much love did you put into what you did

it was love at first sight at last sight at ever and ever sight

love is a fire but whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house you can never tell

my dear

find what you love and let it kill you

let it drain you of your all let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness

let it kill you and let it devour your remains

for all things will kill you both slowly and fastly but it’s much better to be killed by a lover

falsely yours

i will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way

and now these three remain faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love

if you love somebody let them go for if they return they were always yours if they dont they never were

i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun

i have something i need to tell you he says i run my fingers along the tendons in his hands and look back at him i might be in love with you he smiles a little im waiting until im sure to tell you though

thats sensible of you i say smiling too we should find some paper so you can make a list or a chart or something

i feel his laughter against my side his nose sliding along my jaw his lips pressing my ear

maybe im already sure he says and i just dont want to frighten you

i laugh a little then you should know better

fine he says then i love you

you are the answer to every prayer ive offered you are a song a dream a whisper and i dont know how i could have lived without you for as long as i have

i can feel peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks so now that youve got me what are you going to do with me i turn into him put you somewhere you cant get hurt

if pain must come may it come quickly because i have a life to live and i need to live it in the best way possible if he has to make a choice may he make it now then i will either wait for him or forget him

be careful of love itll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong

how many slams in an old screen door depends how loud you shut it how many slices in a bread depends how thin you cut it how much good inside a day depends how good you live em how much love inside a friend depends how much you give em

love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does love is a battle love is a war love is a growing up

if you like her if she makes you happy and if you feel like you know herthen dont let her go

when love is not madness it is not love

it is good to love many things for therein lies the true strength and whosoever loves much performs much and can accomplish much and what is done in love is well done

i love you more than there are stars in the sky and fish in the sea

declarations of love amuse me especially when unrequited

true love is rare and its the only thing that gives life real meaning

do you think im pretty

i think youre beautiful

you are so beautiful it hurts sometimes

whats this he demanded looking from clary to his companions as if they might know what she was doing there

its a girl jace saidrecovering his composure surely youve seen girls before alec your sister isabelle is one

a womans heart should be so hidden in god that a man has to seek him just to find her

i love you remember they cannot take it

i think if it is true that

there are as many minds as there

are heads then there are as many

kinds of love as there are hearts

love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired

i was smiling yesterdayi am smiling today and i will smile tomorrowsimply because life is too short to cry for anything

i loved her against reason against promise against peace against hope against happiness against all discouragement that could be

the most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much and forgetting that you are special too

if i can stop one heart from breaking i shall not live in vain

it is a curious thought but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them

when the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace

of all forms of caution caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness

is this the moment harry asked weakly and when nothing happened except that ron and hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot he raised his voice oi theres a war going on here

ron and hermione broke apart their arms still around each other

i know mate said ron who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a bludger so its now or never isnt it

never mind that what about the horcrux harry shouted dyou think you could just  just hold it in until weve got the diadem

yeah  right  sorry  said ron and he and hermione set about gathering up fangs both pink in the face

more smiling less worrying more compassion less judgment more blessed less stressed more love less hate

all i ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart

what is love i have met in the streets a very poor young man who was in love his hat was old his coat worn the water passed through his shoes and the stars through his soul

well now

if little by little you stop loving me

i shall stop loving you

little by little

if suddenly you forget me

do not look for me

for i shall already have forgotten you

if you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my life

and you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where i have roots

that on that day at that hour i shall lift my arms

and my roots will set off to seek another land

what is hell i maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love

the greater the love the greater the tragedy when its over

find what you love and let it kill you

if you gave someone your heart and they died did they take it with them did you spend the rest of forever with a hole inside you that couldnt be filled

if shes amazing she wont be easy if shes easy she wont be amazing if shes worth it you wont give up if you give up youre not worthy  truth is everybody is going to hurt you you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for

its not the face but the expressions on it its not the voice but what you say its not how you look in that body but the thing you do with it you are beautiful

never close your lips to those whom you have already opened your heart

it isnt possible to love and part you will wish that it was you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal

the man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends

things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end if not always in the way we expect

any fool can be happy it takes a man with real heart to make beauty out of the stuff that makes us weep

you know when it works love is pretty amazing its not overrated theres a reason for all those songs

love is not affectionate feeling but a steady wish for the loved persons ultimate good as far as it can be obtained

they say when you are missing someone that they are probably feeling the same but i dont think its possible for you to miss me as much as im missing you right now

gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love

to me fearless is not the absense of fear its not being completely unafraid to me fearless is having fears fearless is having doubts lots of them to me fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death

we waste time looking for the perfect lover instead of creating the perfect love

to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees

be the reason someone smiles be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness in people

i love you like a fat kid loves cake

one cannot think well love well sleep well if one has not dined well

have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time

and when her lips met mine i knew that i could live to be a hundred and visit every country in the world but nothing would ever compare to that single moment when i first kissed the girl of my dreams and knew that my love would last forever

it is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important

i would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only i would like to be that unnoticed and that necessary

welcome to the wonderful world of jealousy he thought for the price of admission you get a splitting headache a nearly irresistable urge to commit murder and an inferiority complex yippee

he does something to me that boy every time it’s his only detriment he steps on my heart he makes me cry

you couldnt relive your life skipping the awful parts without losing what made it worthwhile you had to accept it as a wholelike the world or the person you loved

as if you were on fire from within

the moon lives in the lining of your skin

love is an untamed force when we try to control it it destroys us when we try to imprison it it enslaves us when we try to understand it it leaves us feeling lost and confused

life he realize was much like a song in the beginning there is mystery in the end there is confirmation but its in the middle where all the emotion resides to make the whole thing worthwhile

look after my heart  ive left it with you

tonight i can write the saddest lines

i loved her and sometimes she loved me too

you cant measure the mutual affection of two human beings by the number of words they exchange

how do you spell love  piglet

you dont spell ityou feel it  pooh

happiness is only real when shared

i crave your mouth your voice your hair

silent and starving i prowl through the streets

bread does not nourish me dawn disrupts me all day

i hunt for the liquid measure of your steps

i hunger for your sleek laugh

your hands the color of a savage harvest

hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails

i want to eat your skin like a whole almond

i want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body

the sovereign nose of your arrogant face

i want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes

and i pace around hungry sniffing the twilight

hunting for you for your hot heart

like a puma in the barrens of quitratue

and then he gives me a smile that just seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me

maybeyoull fall in love with me all over again

hell i said i love you enough now what do you want to do ruin me

yes i want to ruin you

good i said thats what i want too

i wasnt actually in love but i felt a sort of tender curiosity

letting go doesnt mean that you dont care about someone anymore its just realizing that the only person you really have control over is yourself

someone i loved once gave me a box full of darkness it took me years to understand that this too was a gift

was it hard i ask

not as hard as holding on to something that wasnt real

sometimes its a form of love just to talk to somebody that you have nothing in common with and still be fascinated by their presence

a definition not found

in the dictionary

not leaving an act of trust and love

often deciphered by children

when i am with you we stay up all night

when youre not here i cant go to sleep

praise god for those two insomnias

and the difference between them

one day you will kiss a man you cant breathe without and find that breath is of little consequence

tears shed for another person are not a sign of weakness they are a sign of a pure heart

art and love are the same thing it’s the process of seeing yourself in things that are not you

anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves so anyone whos in love gets sad when they think of their lover its like stepping back inside a room you have fond memories of one you havent seen in a long time

i loved you like a man loves a woman he never touches only writes to keeps little photographs of

promise me youll never forget me because if i thought you would id never leave

then i realize what it is its him something about him makes me feel like i am about to fall or turn to liquid or burst into flames

every one of us is in the cosmic perspective precious if a human disagrees with you let him live in a hundred billion galaxies you will not find another

im saying that im a moody insecure narrowminded jealous borderline homicidal bitch and i want you to promise me that youre okay with that because its who i am and youre what i need

you yourself as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection

sometimes when i look at you i feel im gazing at a distant star

its dazzling but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago

maybe the star doesnt even exist any more yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything

im not sentimentalim as romantic as you are the idea you know

is that the sentimental person thinks things will lastthe romantic

person has a desperate confidence that they wont

a purpose of human life no matter who is controlling it is to love whoever is around to be loved

be with me always  take any form  drive me mad only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you oh god it is unutterable i can not live without my life i can not live without my soul

the saddest people ive ever met in life are the ones who dont care deeply about anything at all passion and satisfaction go hand in hand and without them any happiness is only temporary because theres nothing to make it last

a halfread book is a halffinished love affair

if conversation was the lyrics laughter was the music making time spent together a melody that could be replayed over and over without getting stale

to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance

you could have fooled me everytime i called you luke said you were sick i figured you were avoiding me again

i wasnt i did want to talk to you ive been thinking about you all the time

ive been thinking about you too

i really was sick i swear i almost died back there on the ship you know

i know everytime you almost die i almost die myself

happiness is holding someone in your arms and knowing you hold the whole world

im on aslans side even if there isnt any aslan to lead it im going to live as like a narnian as i can even if there isnt any narnia

im oxygen and hes dying to breathe

there is only one page left to write on i will fill it with words of only one syllable i love i have loved i will love

respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be

who being loved is poor

love can change a person the way a parent can change a baby awkwardly and often with a great deal of mess

people have forgotten this truth the fox said but you mustn’t forget it you become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed you’re responsible for your rose

do not fall in love with people like me

i will take you to museums and parks and monuments and kiss you in every beautiful place so that you can never go back to them without tasting me like blood in your mouth

i will destroy you in the most beautiful way possible and when i leave you will finally understand why storms are named after people

i like flaws i think they make things interesting

it is easy to love people in memory the hard thing is to love them when they are there in front of you

friendship marks a life even more deeply than love love risks degenerating into obsession friendship is never anything but sharing

peeta how come i never know when youre having a nightmare i say

i dont know i dont think i cry out or thrash around or anything i just come to paralyzed with terror he says

you should wake me i say thinking about how i can interrupt his sleep two or three times on a bad night about how long it can take to calm me down

its not necessary my nightmares are usually about losing you he says im okay once i realize youre here

you know how they say you only hurt the ones you love well it works both ways

frees us of all the weight and pain of life

that word is love

the heart has its reasons which reason knows not

when i saw you i fell in love and you smiled because you knew

time was passing like a hand waving from a train i wanted to be on

i hope you never have to think about anything as much as i think about you

i fell in love with her when we were together then fell deeper in love with her in the years we were apart

the love of learning the sequestered nooks

and all the sweet serenity of books

what she had realized was that love was that moment when your heart was about to burst

trust your heart if the seas catch fire live by love though the stars walk backward

ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation

the emotion that can break your heart is sometimes the very one that heals it

sorrow is how we learn to love your heart isnt breaking it hurts because its getting larger the larger it gets the more love it holds

top  things money can’t buy

come sleep with me we wont make love love will make us

from childhoods hour i have not been as others were i have not seen as others saw i could not awaken my heart to joy at the same tone and all i loved i loved alone

the more one judges the less one loves

holding eleanors hand was like holding a butterfly or a heartbeat like holding something complete and completely alive

i guess that’s just part of loving people you have to give things up sometimes you even have to give them up

when god created mothers

when the good lord was creating mothers he was into his sixth day of overtime when the angel appeared and said youre doing a lot of fiddling around on this one

the angel shook her head slowly and said six pairs of hands no way

its not the hands that are causing me problems god remarked its the three pairs of eyes that mothers have to have

thats on the standard model asked the angel god nodded

god said the angel touching his sleeve gently get some rest tomorrow

i cant said god im so close to creating something so close to myself already i have one who heals herself when she is sickcan feed a family of six on one pound of hamburgerand can get a nine year old to stand under a shower

the angel circled the model of a mother very slowly its too soft she sighed

but tough said god excitedly you can imagine what this mother can do or endure

can it think

not only can it think but it can reason and compromise said the creator

finally the angel bent over and ran her finger across the cheek

theres a leak she pronounced i told you that you were trying to put too much into this model

its not a leak said the lord its a tear

whats it for

its for joy sadness disappointment pain loneliness and pride

you are a genius  said the angel

somberly god said i didnt put it there

if someone were to harm my family or a friend or somebody i love i would eat them i might end up in jail for  years but i would eat them

to be fully seen by somebody then and be loved anyhow  this is a human offering that can border on miraculous

i wonder how many people dont get the one they want but end up with the one theyre supposed to be with

when someone is in your heart theyre never truly gone they can come back to you even at unlikely times

sometimes love means letting go when you want to hold on tighter

in your light i learn how to love in your beauty how to make poems you dance inside my chest where noone sees you but sometimes i do and that sight becomes this art

dont cry over someone who wouldnt cry over you

absence diminishes small loves and increases great ones as the wind blows out the candle and fans the bonfire

were staying together he promised youre not getting away from me never again

i’ve been fighting to be who i am all my life what’s the point of being who i am if i can’t have the person who was worth all the fighting for

i want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me

to love life to love it even

when you have no stomach for it

and everything youve held dear

crumbles like burnt paper in your hands

your throat filled with the silt of it

when grief sits with you its tropical heat

thickening the air heavy as water

more fit for gills than lungs

when grief weights you like your own flesh

only more of it an obesity of grief

you think how can a body withstand this

then you hold life like a face

between your palms a plain face

no charming smile no violet eyes

and you say yes i will take you

i will love you again

being with you never felt wrong its the one thing i did right youre the one thing i did right

after

all this time

the sun never says to the earth

you owe me

what happens

with a love like that

it lights the whole sky

when you trip over love it is easy to get up but when you fall in love it is impossible to stand again

how do i love thee let me count the ways

i love thee to the depth and breadth and height

my soul can reach

stop fighting me he said trying to pull on the arm he held

he was in a precarious position himself straddling the rail as he tried to lean over far enough to get me and actually hold onto me

let go of me i yelled back

but he was too strong and managed to haul most of me over the rail enough so that i wasn’t in total danger of falling again

i looked him in the eye i will always love you

then i plunged the stake into his chest

that’s what i was supposed to say   he gasped out

those were his last words

this is where it all begins everything starts here today

true love is usually the most inconvenient kind

nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love

without you in my arms i feel an emptiness in my soul i find myself searching the crowds for your face  i know its an impossibility but i cannot help myself

i bet you could sometimes find all the mysteries of the universe in someones hand

watch out for intellect

because it knows so much it knows nothing

and leaves you hanging upside down

mouthing knowledge as your heart

falls out of your mouth

the things we love destroy us every time lad remember that

the sunlight claps the earth and the moonbeams kiss the sea what are all these kissings worth if thou kiss not me

to lose balance sometimes for love is part of living a balanced

the course of true love never did run smooth

i was always hungry for love just once i wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it  to be fed so much love i couldnt take any more just once

throw your dreams into space like a kite and you do not know what it will bring back a new life a new friend a new love a new country

my wish is that you may be loved to the point of madness

the world was collapsing and the only thing that really mattered to me was that she was alive

if we have no peace it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other

if you love something set it free but dont be surprised if it comes back with herpes

this is what we call love when you are loved you can do anything in creation when you are loved theres no need at all to understand whats happening because everything happens within you

i wont ever leave you even though youre always leaving me

sometimes you dont need a goal in life you dont need to know the big picture you just need to know what youre going to do next

i love you as certain dark things are loved secretly between the shadow and the soul

love is    being happy for the other person when they are happy being sad for the person when they are sad being together in good times and being together in bad times

love is the source of strength

love is    being honest with yourself at all times being honest with the other person at all times telling listening respecting the truth and never pretending

love is the source of reality

love is    an understanding so complete that you feel as if you are a part of the other person accepting the other person just the way they are and not trying to change them to be something else

love is the source of unity

love is    the freedom to pursue your own desires while sharing your experiences with the other person the growth of one individual alongside of and together with the growth of another individual

love is the source of success

love is    the excitement of planning things together the excitement of doing things together

love is the source of the future

love is    the fury of the storm the calm in the rainbow

love is the source of passion

love is    giving and taking in a daily situation being patient with each others needs and desires

love is the source of sharing

love is    knowing that the other person will always be with you regardless of what happens missing the other person when they are away but remaining near in heart at all times

love is the source of security

love is    the source of life

sex is the consolation you have when you cant have love

i want to know where to touch you i want to know how to touch you i want to know convince you to design a smile just for me yes i do want to be your friend i want to be your best friend in the entire world

about all you can do in life is be who you are some people will love you for you most will love you for what you can do for them and some wont like you at all

i sought to hear the voice of god and climbed the topmost steeple but god declared go down again  i dwell among the people

romance is the glamour which turns the dust of everyday life into a golden haze

in a perfect world you could fuck people without giving them a piece of your heart and every glittering kiss and every touch of flesh is another shard of heart you’ll never see again

for my part i prefer my heart to be broken it is so lovely dawnkaleidoscopic within the crack

we are not trapped or locked up in these bones no no we are free to change and love changes us and if we can love one another we can break open the sky

if he loved with all the powers of his puny being he couldnt love as much in eighty years as i could in a day

someday youre gonna look back on this moment of your life as such a sweet time of grieving youll see that you were in mourning and your heart was broken but your life was changing

for where all love is the speaking is unnecessary

ok you fuck me then snub me you love me you hate me you show me a sensitive side then you turn into a total asshole is this a pretty accurate description of our relationship

the soul is healed by being with children

you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince

sometimes when im alone i take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train the kisses in the arena

we are who we are be­cause of those we choose to love and be­cause of those who love us

when i look in the mirror i know i’m looking at someone who isn’t sure she deserves to be loved at all

dont waste your love on somebody who doesnt value it

yet each man kills the thing he loves

by each let this be heard

some do it with a bitter look

some with a flattering word

the coward does it with a kiss

the brave man with a sword

the human heart is a strange vessel love and hatred can exist side by side

yours is the light by which my spirits born  you are my sun my moon and all my stars

spending time with you showed me what i’ve been missing in my life

it is possible to be in love with you just because of who you are

if you can love someone with your whole heart even one person then theres salvation in life even if you cant get together with that person

i know enough to know that no woman should ever marry a man who hated his mother

i know thats what people say youll get over it id say it too but i know its not true oh youll be happy again never fear but you wont forget every time you fall in love it will be because something in the man reminds you of him

deny thy father refuse thy name thou art thyself thou not a montegue what is montegue tis nor hand nor foot nor any other part belonging to a man

what is in a name

that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet

so romeo would were he not romeo called retain such dear perfection to which he owes without that title

and for that name which is no part of thee take all thyself

if only she could be so oblivious again to feel such love without knowing it mistaking it for laughter

i almost wish we were butterflies and livd but three summer days  three such days with you i could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain

and what would humans be without love

the music in his laughter had a way of rounding off the missing notes in her soul

each of us is born with a box of matches inside us but we cant strike them all by ourselves

love is how you stay alive even after you are gone

of course you can have a true shadowhunter name will said you can have mine

tessa stared at him all black and white against the blackandwhite snow and stone your name

the moment we begin to seek love love begins to seek us and to save us

its not how much we give but how much love we put into giving

i love mankind he said but i find to my amazement that the more i love mankind as a whole the less i love man in particular

hearts are breakable isabelle said and i think even when you heal youre never what you were before

is it possible in the final analysis for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another

in youth it was a way i had

to do my best to please

and change with every passing lad

to suit his theories

but now i know the things i know

and do the things i do

and if you do not like me so

to hell my love with you

the highest function of love is that it makes the loved one a unique and irreplaceable being

anxiety is loves greatest killer it makes others feel as you might when a drowning man holds on to you you want to save him but you know he will strangle you with his panic

thats what people do who love you they put their arms around you and love you when youre not so lovable

the really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline and effort and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty little unsexy ways every day

love ive come to understand is more than three words mumbled before bedtime

it was many and many a year ago

in a kingdom by the sea

that a maiden there lived whom you may know

by the name of annabel lee

and this maiden she lived with no other thought

than to love and be loved by me

i was a child and she was a child

in this kingdom by the sea

but we loved with a love that was more than love

i and my annabel lee

with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven

coveted her and me

and this was the reason that long ago

in this kingdom by the sea

a wind blew out of a cloud chilling

my beautiful annabel lee

so that her highborn kinsman came

and bore her away from me

to shut her up in a sepulchre

in this kingdom by the sea

the angels not half so happy in heaven

went envying her and me

yes that was the reason as all men know

in this kingdom by the sea

that the wind came out of the cloud by night

chilling and killing my annabel lee

but our love it was stronger by far than the love

of those who were older than we

of many far wiser than we

and neither the angels in heaven above

nor the demons down under the sea

can ever dissever my soul from the soul

of the beautiful annabel lee

for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams

of the beautiful annabel lee

and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes

of the beautiful annabel lee

and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side

of my darling my darling my life and my bride

in the sepulchre there by the sea

in her tomb by the sounding sea

by the time you swear youre his

shivering and sighing

and he vows his passion is

lady make note of this

one of you is lying

sometimes god allows what he hates to accomplish what he loves

and next time youre planning to injure yourself to get me attention just remember that a little sweet talk works wonders

let yourself be drawn by the stronger pull of that which you truly love

its hard being left behind  its hard to be the one who stays

id learned that some things are best kept secret

she was my dream she made me who i am and holding her in my arms was more natural to me than my own heartbeat i think about her all the time even now when im sitting here i think about her there could never have been another

we are told that people stay in love because of chemistry or because they remain intrigued with each other because of many kindnesses because of luck but part of it has got to be forgiveness and gratefulness

so it’s true when all is said and done grief is the price we pay for love

good night good night parting is such sweet sorrow

that i shall say good night till it be morrow

love is not the absence of logic

but logic examined and recalculated

heated and curved to fit

inside the contours of the heart

of course i’ll hurt you of course you’ll hurt me of course we will hurt each other but this is the very condition of existence to become spring means accepting the risk of winter to become presence means accepting the risk of absence

let me not to the marriage of true minds

admit impediments love is not love

which alters when it alteration finds

or bends with the remover to remove

o no it is an everfixed mark

that looks on tempests and is never shaken

it is the star to every wandring barque

whose worths unknown although his height be taken

loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks

within his bending sickles compass come

love alters not with his brief hours and weeks

but bears it out even to the edge of doom

if this be error and upon me proved

i never writ nor no man ever loved

i have feelings too i am still human all i want is to be loved for myself and for my talent

true love is not so much a matter of romance as it is a matter of anxious concern for the wellbeing of ones companion

despite your best efforts people are going to be hurt when its time for them to be hurt

just because youre beautiful and perfect its made you conceited

it happens like this

its so dark right now i cant see any light around me

thats because the light is coming from you you cant see it but everyone else can

i wondered what happened when you offered yourself to someone and they opened you only to discover you were not the gift they expected and they had to smile and nod and say thank you all the same

i like my body when it is with your

body it is so quite new a thing

muscles better and nerves more

i like your body i like what it does

i like its hows i like to feel the spine

of your body and its bones and the trembling

firmsmooth ness and which i will

again and again and again

kiss i like kissing this and that of you

i like slowly stroking the shocking fuzz

of your electric fur and whatisit comes

over parting flesh  and eyes big lovecrumbs

and possibly i like the thrill

of under me you so quite new

i told you you dont love someone because of their looks or their clothes or their car you love them because they sing a song only your heart can understand

no woman wants to be in submission to a man who isnt in submission to god

moments when lost cant be found again theyre just gone

and he suddenly knew that if she killed herself he would die maybe not immediately maybe not with the same blinding rush of pain but it would happen you couldnt live for very long without a heart

ill fight it ill fight it for you dont you worry about me hazel grace im okay ill find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time

romance is thinking about your significant other when you are supposed to be thinking about something else

when its gone youll know what a gift love was youll suffer like this so go back and fight to keep it

you are the one girl that made me risk eveything for a future worth having

love possesses not nor would it be possessed for love is sufficient unto love and think not you can direct the course of love if it finds you worthy directs your course love has no other desire but to fulfil itself

love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get  only with what you are expecting to give  which is everything

there is always something left to love

if you forget me

i want you to know

you know how this is

if i look

at the crystal moon at the red branch

of the slow autumn at my window

if i touch

near the fire

the impalpable ash

or the wrinkled body of the log

everything carries me to you

as if everything that exists

were little boats

that sail

toward those isles of yours that wait for me

well now

if little by little you stop loving me

i shall stop loving you little by little

if suddenly

you forget me

do not look for me

for i shall already have forgotten you

if you think it long and mad

the wind of banners

that passes through my life

and you decide

to leave me at the shore

of the heart where i have roots

that on that day

at that hour

i shall lift my arms

and my roots will set off

to seek another land

but

if each day

each hour

you feel that you are destined for me

with implacable sweetness

if each day a flower

climbs up to your lips to seek me

ah my love ah my own

in me all that fire is repeated

in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten

my love feeds on your love beloved

and as long as you live it will be in your arms

goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes because for those who love with heart and soul there is no such thing as separation

she wanted something else something different something more passion and romance perhaps or maybe quiet conversations in candlelit rooms or perhaps something as simple as not being second

why are old lovers able to become friends two reasons they never truly loved each other or they love each other still

if youre a bird im a bird

real isnt how you are made said the skin horse its a thing that happens to you when a child loves you for a long long time not just to play with but really loves you then you become real

does it hurt asked the rabbit

sometimes said the skin horse for he was always truthful when you are real you dont mind being hurt

does it happen all at once like being wound up he asked or bit by bit

love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real

what are the chances you’d ever meet someone like that he wondered someone you could love forever someone who would forever love you back and what did you do when that person was born half a world away the math seemed impossible

its bullshit to think of friendship and romance as being different theyre not theyre just variations of the same love variations of the same desire to be close

to say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around is a paradox people eventually get sick of waiting take a chance on someone and by the art of commitment become soulmates which takes a lifetime to perfect

i belong to my beloved and my beloved is mine

the heart is the toughest part of the body

tenderness is in the hands

true love comes quietly without banners or flashing lights if you hear bells get your ears checked

in desperate love we always invent the characters of our partners demanding they be what we need of them and then feeling devastated when they refuse to perform the role we created in the first place

if my love were an ocean

there would be no more land

if my love were a desert

you would see only sand

if my love were a star

late at night only light

and if my love could grow wings

id be soaring in flight

love n a temporary insanity curable by marriage

i um i have this problem i broke up with my boyfriend you see and im pretty upset about it so i wanted to talk to my best friend  the thing is theyre both you

well ron said finally looking up at harry how was it

harry considered it for a moment wet he said truthfully

ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust it was hard to tell

because she was crying harry continued heavily

oh said ron his smile faded slightly are you that bad at kissing

dunno said harry who hadnt considered this and immediately felt rather worried maybe i am

love it never dies it never goes away it never fades so long as you hang on to it love can make you immortal

someday youll find someone special again people whove been in love once usually do its in their nature

i wonder if fears ever really go away or if they just lose their power over us

there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people

you say you love rain but you use an umbrella to walk under it you say you love sun but you seek shelter when it is shining you say you love wind but when it comes you close your windows so thats why im scared when you say you love me

we rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new but to feel nothing so as not to feel anything  what a waste

what greater gift than the love of a cat

you only need one man to love you but him to love you free like a wildfire crazy like the moon always like tomorrow sudden like an inhale and overcoming like the tides only one man and all of this

and to the devil with it if she is said the consul one girl who is not nephilim is not cannot be our priority

she is my priority will shouted

theres a difference between really loving someone and loving the idea of her

we are all the pieces of what we remember we hold in ourselves the hopes and fears of those who love us as long as there is love and memory there is no true loss

every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own in pain and sickness it would still be dear

if a thing loves it is infinite

name one hero who was happy

i considered heracles went mad and killed his family theseus lost his bride and father jasons children and new wife were murdered by his old bellerophon killed the chimera but was crippled by the fall from pegasus back

you cant he was sitting up now leaning forward

i cant

i know they never let you be famous and happy he lifted an eyebrow ill tell you a secret

tell me i loved it when he was like this

im going to be the first he took my palm and held it to his swear it

why me

because youre the reason swear it

i swear it i said lost in the high color of his cheeks the flame in his eyes

i swear it he echoed

we sat like that a moment hands touching he grinned

i feel like i could eat the world raw

it doesnt matter who you are or what you look like so long as somebody loves you

after all this time

trust no friend without faults and love a woman but no angel

we must love one another or die

you are like nobody since i love you

oh no dont smile youll kill me i stop breathing when you smile

i think it is all a matter of love the more you love a memory the stronger and stranger it becomes

the best things in life make you sweaty

my great hope is to laugh as much as i cry to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return

in love no question is ever preposterous

the greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved  loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves

love is a better master than duty

because if you could love someone and keep loving them without being loved back    then that love had to be real it hurt too much to be anything else

happily ever after or even just together ever after is not cheesy wren said it’s the noblest like the most courageous thing two people can shoot for

im out in the woods i am out on my own

i found me a werewolf a nasty old mutt

it showed me its teeth and went straight for my gut

im out in the woods i am out on my own

i was stopped by a vampire a rotting old wreck

it showed me its teeth and went straight for my neck

mama mama put me to bed

i wont make it home im already halfdead

i met an invalid and fell for his art

he showed me his smile and went straight for my heart

from a childs walk home nursery rhymes and folk tales

i think we ought to live happily ever after

no matter how much you think you love somebody youll step back when the pool of their blood edges up too close

he is beauty inside and out

he is the silver lining in a world of darkness

he is my light

she didnt understand that how can anyone be afraid of love

hiding how you really feel and trying to make everyone happy doesnt make you nice it just makes you a liar

his voice dropped nearly to a whisper and his arms tightened around me

lord ye gave me a rare woman and god i loved her well

the scariest thing about distance is that you don’t know whether they’ll miss you or forget you

its okay he said were together he didnt say youre okay or were alive after all theyd been through over the last year he knew that the most important thing was that they were together she loved him for saying that

believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it

in real life love has to be possible even if it is not returned right away love can only survive when the hope exists that you will be able to win over the person you desire

nothing ever happens like you imagine it will

no dimitri interrupted gently he moved his face toward mine our foreheads nearly touching it wont happen to you youre too strong youll fight it just like you did this

i only did because you were here he wrapped his arms around me and i buried my face in his chest i cant do it by myself i whispered

you can he said there was a tremulous note in his voice youre strong—youre so so strong its why i love you

love is an abstract noun something nebulous and yet love turns out to be the only part of us that is solid as the world turns upside down and the screen goes black

we cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known and when we honor the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust respect kindness and affection

love is not something we give or get it is something that we nurture and grow a connection that can only be cultivated between two people when it exists within each one of them – we can only love others as much as we love ourselves

shame blame disrespect betrayal and the withholding of affection damage the roots from which love grows love can only survive these injuries if they are acknowledged healed and rare

the damage was permanent there would always be scars but even the angriest scars faded over time until it was difficult to see them written on the skin at all and the only thing that remained was the memory of how painful it had been

the fate of your heart is your choice and no one else gets a vote

unless you love someone nothing else makes sense

love and compassion are necessities not luxuries without them humanity cannot survive

love cannot be reduced to a catalogue of reasons why and a catalogue of reasons cannot be put together into love

he stared at her knowing with certainty that he was falling in love he pulled her close and kissed her beneath a blanket of stars wondering how on earth hed been lucky enough to find her

we are all worthy of one another

do i love you my god if your love were a grain of sand mine would be a universe of beaches

with him life was routine without him life was unbearable

the day the power of love overrules the love of power the world will know peace

the great tragedy of life is not that men perish but that they cease to love

i don’t know what they are called the spaces between seconds– but i think of you always in those intervals

if someone thinks that peace and love are just a cliche that must have been left behind in the s thats a problem peace and love are eternal

anyone who loves in the expectation of being loved in return is wasting their time

if theres a thing ive learned in my life its to not be afraid of the responsibility that comes with caring for other people what we do for love those things endure even if the people you do them for dont

those sweet lips my oh my i could kiss those lips all night long

good things come to those who wait

i have never found anybody who could stand to accept the daily demonstrative love i feel in me and give back as good as i give

the only thing more unthinkable than leaving was staying the only thing more impossible than staying was leaving

because of you in gardens of blossoming

flowers i ache from the perfumes of spring

i have forgotten your face i no longer

remember your hands how did your lips

because of you i love the white statues

drowsing in the parks the white statues that

have neither voice nor sight

i have forgotten your voice your happy voice

i have forgotten your eyes

like a flower to its perfume i am bound to

my vague memory of you i live with pain

that is like a wound if you touch me you will

make to me an irreperable harm

your caresses enfold me like climbing

i have forgotten your love yet i seem to

glimpse you in every window

because of you the heady perfumes of

summer pain me because of you i again

seek out the signs that precipitate desires

snapes patronus was a doe said harry the same as my mothers because he loved her for nearly all of his life from when they were children

accept the things to which fate binds you and love the people with whom fate brings you togetherbut do so with all your heart

you two are too cute the counter girl said setting two cups piled with whipped cream on the counter she had a sort of lopsided open smile that made me think she laughed a lot seriously how long have you been going out

sam let go of my hands to get his wallet and took out some bills six years

i wrinkled my nose to cover a laugh of course he would count the time that we’d been two entirely different species

whoa counter girl nodded appreciatively that’s pretty amazing for a couple your age

sam handed me my hot chocolate and didn’t answer but his yellow eyes gazed at me possessively—i wondered if he realized that the way he looked at me was far more intimate than copping a feel could ever be

i crouched to look at the almond bark on the bottom shelf in the counter i wasn’t quite bold enough to look at either of them when i admitted well it was love at first sight

the girl sighed that is just so romantic do me a favor and don’t you two ever change the world needs more love at first sight

if you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart then youre allowing them to hurt you a second time in your mind

the moment you stop to think about whether you love someone youve already stopped loving that person forever

i may not always be with you

but when were far apart

remember you will be with me

right inside my heart

i know my heart will never be the same

but im telling myself ill be okay

love sucks sometimes it feels good sometimes its just another way to bleed

wherever you will go

i will let you down

but this lullaby goes on

love is a rebellious bird

that nobody can tame

and you call him quite in vain

if it suits him not to come

do what you love love what you do and with all your heart give yourself to it

youre like a song that i heard when i was a little kid but forgot i knew until i heard it again

when you love someone you say their name different like its safe inside your mouth

if i were to live a thousand years i would belong to you for all of them if we were to live a thousand lives i would want to make you mine in each one

it’s dark now and i am very tired i love you always time is nothing

im not sure this is a world i belong in anymore im not sure that i want to wake up

we always see our worst selves our most vulnerable selves we need someone else to get close enough to tell us we’re wrong someone we trust

if you can capture a womans imagination then you will have her but imagination is a strange creature it needs time and distance to function properly

the bible tells us to love our neighbors and also to love our enemies probably because generally they are the same people

shes drunk joe bell informed me

every true love and friendship is a story of unexpected transformation if we are the same person before and after we loved that means we havent loved enough

there aint no way you can hold onto something that wants to go you understand you can only love what you got while you got it

ye are blood of my blood and bone of my bone

i give ye my body that we two might be one

i give ye my spirit til our life shall be done

its funny how you can forget everything except people loving you maybe thats why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs its not the pain theyre getting over its the love

we could do it you know

what

leave the district run off live in the woods you and i we could make it

heaven would never be heaven without you

shall i compare thee to a summers day

thou art more lovely and more temperate

rough winds do shake the darling buds of may

and summers lease hath all too short a date

sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines

and too often is his gold complexion dimmd

and every fair from fair sometimes declines

by chance or natures changing course untrimmd

by thy eternal summer shall not fade

nor lose possession of that fair thou owest

nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade

when in eternal lines to time thou growest

so long as men can breathe or eyes can see

so long lives this and this gives life to thee

what would you do if i kissed you right now

i stared at his beautiful face and his beautiful mouth and i wanted nothing more than to taste it i would kiss you back

you really love her dont you she said

with all my heart

she looked as sad as id ever seen her

whats your heart telling you to do

i dont know

maybe she said gentlyyoure trying to hard to hear it

to fear love is to fear life and those who fear life are already parts dead

if you ever looked at me once with what i know is in you i would be your slave

im saying im in love with you ive been in love with you this whole bleeding year

we cant he told me

parents were the only ones obligated to love you from the rest of the world you had to earn it

my mother she is beautiful softened at the edges and tempered with a spine of steel i want to grow old and be like her

im like you he said i remember everything

love recognizes no barriers it jumps hurdles leaps fences penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope

were all a little weird and life is a little weird and when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness — and call it love — true love

you have a remarkable memory

i remember everything about you youre the one who wasnt paying attention

in the darkness two shadows reaching through the hopeless heavy dusk their hands meet and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun

morning without you is a dwindled dawn

some people feel like they dont deserve love they walk away quietly into empty spaces trying to close the gaps of the past

its not that you should never love something so much that it can control you

its that you need to love something that much so you can never be controlled

its not a weakness

its your best strength

whenever you are confronted with an opponent conquer him with love

ginny listeni cant be involved with you anymore weve got to stop seeing each other we cant be together

its for some stupid noble reason isnt it

what if i dont care

i care how do you think id feel if this was your funeraland it was my fault

she wasnt doing a thing that i could see except standing there leaning on the balcony railing holding the universe together

you are my life now

anyone can love a thing because thats as easy as putting a penny in your pocket

but to love something despite to know the flaws and love them too that is rare and pure and perfect

the strongest love is the love that can demonstrate its fragility

i dreamed i spoke in anothers language

i dreamed i lived in anothers skin

i dreamed i was my own beloved

i dreamed i was a tigers kin

i dreamed that eden lived inside me

and when i breathed a garden came

i dreamed i knew all of creation

i dreamed i knew the creators name

i dreamedand this dream was the finest

that all i dreamed was real and true

and we would live in joy forever

you in me and me in you

i love you t

if you love a flower that lives on a star it is sweet to look at the sky at night all the stars are abloom with flowers

its the imperfections that make things beautiful

one day spent with someone you love can change everything

being with you and not being with you is the only way i have to measure time

i envy people that know love that have someone who takes them as they are

if i die i will wait for you do you understand no matter how long i will watch from beyond to make sure you live every year you have to its fullest and then we’ll have so much to talk about when i see you again… bones

there is no love sincerer than the love of food

love is a luxury

no love is an element

an element like air to breathe earth to stand on

i know that the whole point—the only point—is to

find the things that matter and hold on to them and fight for them and refuse to

let them go

when in a relationship a real man doesnt make his woman jealous of others he makes others jealous of his woman

sleep my little babyoh

sleep until you waken

when you wake youll see the world

if im not mistaken

find your name

and buried treasure

face your life

its pain

its pleasure

leave no path untaken

she is a friend of my mind she gather me man the pieces i am she gather them and give them back to me in all the right order

i dont care if youre black white straight bisexual gay lesbian short tall fat skinny rich or poor if youre nice to me ill be nice to you simple as that

love the reason i dislike that word is that it means too much for me far more than you can understand

her heart was a secret garden and the walls were very high

his heart danced upon her movements like a cork upon a tide he heard what her eyes said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim past whether in life or revery he had heard their tale before

i will not try to convince you to love me to respect me to commit to me i deserve better than that i am better than thatgoodbye

remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other

when you have seen as much of life as i have you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love

friends are the family you choose  ninithilnin elven rogue

i can write the saddest poem of all tonight

write for instance the night is full of stars

and the stars blue shiver in the distance

the night wind whirls in the sky and sings

i can write the saddest poem of all tonight

i loved her and sometimes she loved me too

on nights like this i held her in my arms

i kissed her so many times under the infinite sky

she loved me sometimes i loved her

how could i not have loved her large still eyes

i can write the saddest poem of all tonight

to think i dont have her to feel that ive lost her

to hear the immense night more immense without her

and the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass

what does it matter that my love couldnt keep her

the night is full of stars and she is not with me

thats all far away someone sings far away

my soul is lost without her

as if to bring her near my eyes search for her

my heart searches for her and she is not with me

the same night that whitens the same trees

we we who were we are the same no longer

i no longer love her true but how much i loved her

my voice searched the wind to touch her ear

someone elses she will be someone elses as she once

belonged to my kisses

i no longer love her true but perhaps i love her

love is so short and oblivion so long

because on nights like this i held her in my arms

my soul is lost without her

although this may be the last pain she causes me

and this may be the last poem i write for her

unrequited love does not die its only beaten down to a secret place where it hides curled and wounded for some unfortunates it turns bitter and mean and those who come after pay the price for the hurt done by the one who came before

i have a million things to talk to you about all i want in this world is you i want to see you and talk i want the two of us to begin everything from the beginning

please mia he implores dont make me write a song

love is like a brick you can build a house or you can sink a dead body

if i love you what business is it of yours

love the poet said is womans whole existence

it is an absolute human certainty that no one can know his own beauty or perceive a sense of his own worth until it has been reflected back to him in the mirror of another loving caring human being

i met an old lady once almost a hundred years old and she told me there are only two questions that human beings have ever fought over all through history how much do you love me and whos in charge

all my heart is yours sir it belongs to you and with you it would remain were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence forever

maybe i was destined to forever fall in love with people i couldn’t have maybe there’s a whole assortment of impossible people waiting for me to find them waiting to make me feel the same impossibility over and over again

someday we’ll run into each other again i know it

maybe i’ll be older and smarter and just plain better if that happens

that’s when i’ll deserve you but now at this moment you can’t hook

your boat to mine because i’m liable to sink us both

i know youre tired but come this is the way

how can i be reasonable to me our love was everything and you were my whole life it is not very pleasant to realize that to you it was only an episode

keep your best wishes close to your heart and watch what happens

the great thing to remember is that though our feelings come and go gods love for us does not

ive always loved you and when you love someone you love the whole person just as he or she is and not as you would like them to be

i dont care what you say to me i care what you share with me

in this world it is too common for people to search for someone to lose themselves in but i am already lost i will look for someone to find myself in

the voice of love seemed to call to me but it was a wrong number

when you are old

when you are old and grey and full of sleep

and nodding by the fire take down this book

and slowly read and dream of the soft look

your eyes had once and of their shadows deep

how many loved your moments of glad grace

and loved your beauty with love false or true

but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you

and loved the sorrows of your changing face

and bending down beside the glowing bars

murmur a little sadly how love fled

and paced upon the mountains overhead

and hid his face amid a crowd of stars

promise to give me a kiss on my brow when i am dead i shall feel it

and by the way monsieur marius i believe that i was a little bit in love with you

stephen kissed me in the spring

robin in the fall

but colin only looked at me

and never kissed at all

stephen’s kiss was lost in jest

robin’s lost in play

but the kiss in colin’s eyes

haunts me night and day

hes not your prince charming if he doesnt make sure you know that youre his princess

this is love to fly toward a secret sky to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment first to let go of life finally to take a step without feet

i love you more than i think i should

i belong to the people i love and they belong to methey and the love and loyaty i give them form my identity far more than any word or group ever could

dont leave a piece of jewelry at his house so you can go back and get it later he may be with his real girlfriend

one ought to hold on to ones heart for if one lets it go one soon loses control of the head too

if you want some advice—which im sure you dont—you guys should lay off on the magic christian still thinks youre moving in on lissa

what he asked in mock astonishment doesnt he know my heart belongs to you

it does not and no hes still worried about it despite what ive told him

you know i bet if we started making out right now it would make him feel better

if you touch me i said pleasantly ill provide you with the opportunity to see if you can heal yourself then wed see how badass you really are

when you love someone you let them take care of you

love makes you want to be a better man—right right but maybe love real love also gives you permission to just be the man you are

a thousand halfloves must be forsaken to take one whole heart home

nothing in this world was more difficult than love

love is heavy and light bright and dark hot and cold sick and healthy asleep and awake its everything except what it is act  scene

in silence i grieve

that thy heart could forget

if i should meet thee

after long years

how should i greet thee

with silence and tears

maybe there isn’t such a thing as fate maybe it’s just the opportunities we’re given and what we do with them i’m beginning to think that maybe great epic romances don’t just happen we have to make them ourselves

there is love in holding and there is love in letting go

falling for him would be like cliff diving it would be either the most exhilarating thing that ever happened to me or the stupidest mistake i’d ever make

one day when i am a braver man i will tell her these things and then i will look her in the eye tell her i love her and ask her to be only mine but until that day were just friends

in this part of the story i am the one who

dies the only one and i will die of love because i love you

because i love you love in fire and in blood

no human relation gives one possession in another—every two souls are absolutely different in friendship or in love the two side by side raise hands together to find what one cannot reach alone

he suddenly recalled from platos symposium people were hermaphrodites until god split then in two and now all the halves wander the world over seeking one another love is the longing for the half of ourselves we have lost

i love you remember they cannot take it

i have little left in myself  i must have you the world may laugh  may call me absurd selfish  but it does not signify my very soul demands you it will be satisfied or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame

love is scary it changes it can go away thats the part of the risk i dont want to be scared anymore

because i cant help doing it he said with a shrug and hey if i keep loving you maybe youll eventually crack and love me too hell im pretty sure youre already half in love with me

i am not and everything you just said is ridiculous thats terrible logic

i dont think youre evil

see things are already looking promising

the future for me is already a thing of the past

you were my first love and you will be my last

if i know what love is it is because of you

after all these years i see that i was mistaken about eve in the beginning it is better to live outside the garden with her than inside it without her

if i could but know his heart everything would become easy

why is love intensified by absence

they do not love that do not show their love

four be the things i am wiser to know

idleness sorrow a friend and a foe

four be the things id been better without

love curiosity freckles and doubt

three be the things i shall never attain

envy content and sufficient champagne

three be the things i shall have till i die

laughter and hope and a sock in the eye

how far should a person go in the name of true love

we kiss all the time i clear my throat then add we justdo it in private

a smug expression crosses his face i dont buy it for a second cause if you were my girlfriend and a stud like me was livin in your house id kiss you in front of the guy every chance i got as a reminder

a reminder of wwwhat

that you were mine

he could totally be your boyfriend angel went on with annoying persistance you guys could get married i could be like a junior bridesmaid total could be your flower dog

im only a kid i shrieked i cant get married

you could in new hampshire

my mouth dropped open how does she know this stuff forget it no ones getting married i hissed not in new hampshire or anywhere else not in a box not with a fox now go to sleep before i kill you

woman is sacred the woman one loves is holy

each day brings new opportunities allowing you to constantly live with love—be there for others—bring a little light into someones day be grateful and live each day to the fullest

if i were a tree i would have no reason to love a human

there is no pretendingjace said with absolute clarityi love youand i will love you until i dieand if theres a life after thatill love you then

she caught her breathhe had said itthe words there was no going back from

to love someone means to see them as god intended them

if you truly want to be respected by people you love you must prove to them that you can survive without them

if i have learned anything in this long life of mine it is this in love we find out who we want to be in war we find out who we are

i mean at the end of the day what the hell does it matter who i end up with if it cant be you

it is a long way to ireland janet and i am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels but if i cant do better how is it to be helped are you anything akin to me do you think jane

i could risk no sort of answer by this time my heart was still

though lovers be lost love shall not and death shall have no dominion

life is a series of pulls back and forth a tension of opposites like a pull on a rubber band most of us live somewhere in the middle a wrestling matchwhich side win love wins love always wins

do not swear by the moon for she changes constantly then your love would also change

im gonna fight for you until your heart stops beating

the love that moves the sun and the other stars

last time i saw you i said that it hurt too much to love you but i was wrong about that the truth is it hurts too much not to love you

live your truth express your love share your enthusiasm take action towards your dreams walk your talk dance and sing to your music embrace your blessings make today worth remembering

i wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul

love is our true destiny we do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone  we find it with another

i want love to conquer all but love cant conquer anything it cant do anything on its own

it relies on us to do the conquering on its behalf

ah what happiness it is to be with people who are all happy to press hands press cheeks smile into eyes

love is a serious mental disease

kissing  and i mean like yummy smacking kissing  is the most delicious most beautiful and passionate thing that two people can do bar none better than sex hands down

yelena youve driven me crazy youve caused me considerable trouble and ive contemplated ending your life twice since ive known you valeks warm breath in my ear sent a shiver down my spine

but you’ve slipped under my skin invaded my blood and seized my heart

that sounds more like a poison than a person was all i could say his confession had both shocked and thrilled me

exactly valek replied you have poisoned me

and all i loved i loved alone

who pays any attention

to the syntax of things

will never wholly kiss you

wholly to be a fool

while spring is in the world

my blood approves

and kisses are a far better fate

than wisdom

lady i swear by all flowers dont cry

the best gesture of my brain is less than

your eyelids flutter which says

we are for eachother then

laugh leaning back in my arms

for lifes not a paragraph

and death i think is no parenthesis

there is no intensity of love or feeling that does not involve the risk of crippling hurt it is a duty to take this risk to love and feel without defense or reserve

the power of finding beauty in the humblest things makes home happy and life lovely

the tattoo is just setting below his hp bone

h e l l i s e m p t y

a n d a l l t h e d e v i l s a r e h e r e

i kiss my way across the words

kissing away the devils

kissing away the pain

you’ll never be able to find yourself if you’re lost in someone else

ronan said im always straight

adam replied oh man thats the biggest lie youve ever told

im a little pencil in the hand of a writing god who is sending a love letter to the world

and i wondered if love was too weak a word for what he felt what he’d done for me for what i felt for him

how we need another soul to cling to another body to keep us warm to rest and trust to give your soul in confidence i need this i need someone to pour myself into

i dont know if anyones ever told you this he begins he doesnt blush and his eyes dont dart away instead i find myself staring into a pair of oceans  one perfect the other blemished by that tiny ripple youre very attractive

a slow grin spreads across his face oh trust me i know

i wish you could be kissed jane he said because i would beg just one off you under all this he flailed an arm toward the stars

each relationship between two persons is absolutely unique that is why you cannot love two people the same it simply is not possible you love each person differently because of who they are and the uniqueness that they draw out of you

i have seen the best of you and the worst of you and i choose both

you’ve changed me forever and i’ll never forget you

if you dont receive love from the ones who are meant to love you you will never stop looking for it

but if i hadnt fallen i wouldnt have met you

sometimes it takes a heartbreak to shake us awake  help us see we are worth so much more than were settling for

loving someone and having them love you back is the most precious thing in the world

did i really want to stay on this road longer knowing it was only going to end in devastation

i want to try making things right because picking up the pieces is way better than leaving them the way they are

the story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye the story of love is hello and goodbyeuntil we meet again

then love knew it was called love

and when i lifted my eyes to your name

suddenly your heart showed me my way

let me die the moment my love dies

let me not outlive my own capacity to love

let me die still loving and so never die

he broke off then as if realizing everyone was looking at him again

you want what said dru with enormous eyes

nothing julian said im just talking

to love is to destroy and that to be loved is to be the one destroyed

you never knew the last time you were seeing someone you didnt know when the last argument happened or the last time you had sex or the last time you looked into their eyes and thanked god they were in your life

after they were gone

that was all you thought about

day and night

she wasnt exactly sure when it happened or even when it started all she knew for sure was that right here and now she was falling hard and she could only pray that he was feeling the same way

okay theni can talk ask me something

okay he laughs shakily in my ear why is your heart racing tris

i cringe and say well ii barely know you i barely know you and im crammed up against you in a box four what do you think

maybe you were cut out for candor he says because youre a terrible liar

there are memories that time does not erase forever does not make loss forgettable only bearable

when he died all things soft and beautiful and bright would be buried with him

moving on is easy its staying moved on thats trickier

a fit healthy body—that is the best fashion statement

forever and ever kid until youre sick and tired of seeing me

where there is great love there are always miracles

sometimes you want to say i love you but…

to say i love you but… is to say i did not love you at all

when you forgive you love and when you love god’s light shines upon you

there could have been no two hearts so open no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison

i dont love you anymore she whispered i dont love you at all his throat closed its all right sweetheart i love you enough for both of us

i miss him in so many ways but right now i miss him in the way you always miss someone when youre single among a room full of couples

when is a monster not a monster oh when you love it

i am certain of nothing but the holiness of the hearts affections and the truth of the imagination

you were the sun and i was crashing into you

people should fall in love with their eyes closed

id love to she finally saidon one condition

i steadied myself hoping it wasnt something too awful

you have to promise that you wont fall in love with me

i knew she was kidding me by the way she laughed and i couldnt help but breathe a sigh of relief

sometimes i had to admit jamie had a pretty good sense of humor

i smiled and gave her my word

are you upset little friend have you been lying awake worrying well dont worryim here the flood waters will recede the famine will end the sun will shine tomorrow and i will always be here to take care of you

i am a museum full of art

but you had your eyes shut

but when i do feel all the strength go out of me and i fall to my knees beside the table and i think i cry then or at least i want to and everything inside me screams for just one more kiss one more word one more glance one more

there comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page write another book or simply close it

you know that place between sleep and awake that place where you still remember dreaming that’s where i’ll always love you that’s where i’ll be waiting

one of the things that makes me who i am is the loyalty i have to people i hold close to my heart

love is the voice under all silences the hope which has no opposite in fear the strength so strong mere force is feebleness the truth more first than sun more last than star

love is the strangest most illogical thing in the world

dont go far off not even for a day

because i dont know how to say it  a day is long

and i will be waiting for you as in

an empty station when the trains are

parked off somewhere else asleep

dont leave me even for an hour because then

the little drops of anguish will all run together

the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift

into me choking my lost heart

oh may your silhouette never dissolve

on the beach may your eyelids never flutter

into the empty distance dont leave me for

a second my dearest because in that moment youll

have gone so far ill wander mazily

over all the earth asking will you

come back will you leave me here dying

christian you are the state lottery the cure for cancer and the three wishes from aladdins lamp all rolled into one

theyre in love fuck the war

life is funny things change people change but you will always be you so stay true to yourself and never sacrifice who you are for anyone

ive never minded it he went on being lost that is i had always thought one could not truly be lost if one knew ones own heart but i fear i may be lost without knowing yours

i knew they would kill me when they found out but… he struggled for words releasing a sharp breath i think i realized that i would rather die because i betrayed them than live because i betrayed you

don’t sacrifice yourself too much because if you sacrifice too much there’s nothing else you can give and nobody will care for you

to love means loving the unlovable to forgive means pardoning the unpardonable faith means believing the unbelievable hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless

weeping is not the same thing as crying it takes your whole body to weep and when its over you feel like you dont have any bones left to hold you up

i am no longer in love with her thats certain but maybe i love her love is so short forgetting is so long

adam smiled cheerily ronan would start wars and burn cities for that true smile elastic and amiable

until one has loved an animal a part of ones soul remains unawakened

i have been astonished that men could die martyrs

for their religion

i have shuddered at it

i shudder no more

i could be martyred for my religion

love is my religion

and i could die for that

i could die for you

my creed is love and you are its only tenet

dare to love yourself

as if you were a rainbow

with gold at both ends

to love is to recognize yourself in another

there is a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven

a time to be born and a time to die

a time to plant and a time to uproot

a time to kill and a time to heal

a time to tear down and a time to build

a time to weep and a time to laugh

a time to mourn and a time to dance

a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them

a time to embrace and a time to refrain

a time to search and a time to give up

a time to keep and a time to throw away

a time to tear and a time to mend

a time to be silent and a time to speak

a time to love and a time to hate

a time for war and a time for peace

my heart only ever had one thought one want one need despite all in spite of allall my heart has ever wanted is you

but in a solitary life there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours as stars once a year brush the earth such a constellation was he to me

how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive

did you know i always thought you were braver than me did you ever guess that that was why i was so afraid it wasnt that i only loved some of you but i wondered if you could ever love more than some of me

the lost boys all stood at our wedding does it seem odd to you that they could have stood at a wedding that wasnt yours and mine it does to me and im sorry for it and for a lot and i also wouldnt change it

your peter

ps please give my love to tink she was always such a funny little bug

and now i know why they invented words for love why they had to its the only thing that can come close to describing what i feel in that moment the baffling mixture of pain and pleasure and fear and joy all running sharply through me at once

i felt like an animal and animals don’t know sin do they

yeah well i say i left abnegation because i wasnt selfless enough no matter how hard i tried to be

thats not entirely true he smiles at me that girl who let someone throw knives at her to spare a friend who hit my dad with a belt to protect methat selfless girl thats not you

youve been paying close attention havent you

i like to observe people

maybe you were cut out for candor four because youre a terrible liar

love is not love

which alters when it alteration finds

or bends with the remover to remove

o no it is an everfixed mark

that looks on tempests and is never shaken

it is the star to every wandring bark

whose worths unknown although his height be taken

the only creatures that are evolved enough to convey pure love are dogs and infants

for one human being to love another human being that is perhaps the most difficult task that has been given to us the ultimate the final problem and proof the work for which all other work is merely preparation

limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns it calls me on and on across the universe

i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me

every woman wants a man wholl fall in love with her soul as well as her body

until this moment i had not realized that someone could break your heart twice along the very same fault lines

its the kind of kiss that inspires stars to climb into the sky and light up the world

true love is the best thing in the world except for cough drops

you are my heart my life my entire existence

you’re just another story i can’t tell anymore

actually that’s my secret — i can’t even talk about you to anybody because i don’t want any more people to know how wonderful you are

my soul sees its equal in you

i love you’ he whispered and kissed my brow ‘thorns and all

i ask the impossible love me forever

love me when all desire is gone

love me with the single mindedness of a monk

when the world in its entirety

and all that you hold sacred advise you

against it love me still more

when rage fills you and has no name love me

when each step from your door to our job tires you

love me and from job to home again love me love me

love me when youre bored

when every woman you see is more beautiful than the last

or more pathetic love me as you always have

not as admirer or judge but with

the compassion you save for yourself

in your solitude

love me as you relish your loneliness

the anticipation of your death

mysteries of the flesh as it tears and mends

love me as your most treasured childhood memory

and if there is none to recall

imagine one place me there with you

love me withered as you loved me new

love me as if i were forever

and i will make the impossible

by loving you loving you as i do

the only love that i really believe in is a mother’s love for her children

it does not matter how long you are spending on the earth how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received it is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters

ah she cried you look so cool

their eyes met and they stared together at each other alone in space with an effort she glanced down at the table

you always look so cool she repeated

she had told him that she loved him and tom buchanan saw

choose your love love your choice

i dont want to hurt you or anybody so please forget about me just try find yourself a better friend

then i discovered that being related is no guarantee of love

true love begins when nothing is looked for in return

i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon womans inconstancy songs and proverbs all talk of womans fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all written by men

as lovers the difference between men and women is that women can love all day long but men only at times

what you are is a fucking tragedy simon snow you literally couldnt be a bigger mess

he tries to kiss me but i pull back and you like that

i love it he says

why

because we match

when people fall in love they burst into flames

youre an expert at sorry and keeping the lines blurry

i didnt want to kiss you goodbye — that was the trouble — i wanted to kiss you good night — and theres a lot of difference

in my rush i hadn’t tied my shoelaces noah was now tying them for me

he looked up at me through his dark fringe of lashes and smiled the expression on his face melted me completely i knew i had the goofiest grin plastered on my lips and didn’t care

there he said as he finished tying the laces on my left shoe now you won’t fall

too late

its the kind of kiss that inspires stars to climb into the sky and light up the world

true love is the best thing in the world except for cough drops

you are my heart my life my entire existence

you’re just another story i can’t tell anymore

actually that’s my secret — i can’t even talk about you to anybody because i don’t want any more people to know how wonderful you are

my soul sees its equal in you

there he said as he finished tying the laces on my left shoe now you won’t fall

too late

i find the best way to love someone is not to change them but instead help them reveal the greatest version of themselves

had i the heavens embroidered cloths

enwrought with golden and silver light

the blue and the dim and the dark cloths

of night and light and the half light

i would spread the cloths under your feet

but i being poor have only my dreams

i have spread my dreams under your feet

tread softly because you tread on my dreams

its all right said wolf you loved her i would feel the same if someone wanted to erase scarlets identity and give it to levanas army

scarlet stiffened heat rushing into her cheeks he certainly wasnt insinuating

aaaaw squealed iko did wolf just say that he loves scarlet thats so cute

scarlet cringed he did notthat wasnt she balled her fists against her sides can we get back to these soldiers that are being rounded up please

is she blushing she sounds like shes blushing

shes blushing thorne confirmed shuffling the cards actually wolf is also looking a little flustered

of all our games loves play is the only one which threatens to unsettle the soul

i will follow you to the ends of the world

this is what happened in love one of you cried a lot and then both of you grew sarcastic

amor fati – love your fate which is in fact your life

there is a good deal of comfort now in remembering this

be the one who nurtures and builds be the one who has an understanding and a forgiving heart one who looks for the best in people leave people better than you found them

autumn is the hardest season the leaves are all falling and theyre falling like

theyre falling in love with the ground

fear doesnt shut you down it wakes you up ive seen it its fascinating he releases me but doesnt pull away his hand grazing my jaw my neck sometimes i justwant to see it again want to see you awake

he did not care if she was heartless vicious and vulgar stupid and grasping he loved her he would rather have misery with one than happiness with the other

how could i have ever been ashamed of loving dante quintana

i dont care if you danced naked on the roof of the little palace with him i love you alina even the part of you that loved him

i cant set my hopes too high

cause every hello ends with a goodbye

if you love something so much let it go if it comes back it was meant to be if it doesnt it never was

would you destroy something perfect in order to make it beautiful

what irritated me most in that entire situation was the fact that i

wasn’t feeling humiliated or annoyed or even fooled betrayal was

what i felt my heart broken not just by a guy i was in love with but

also by as i once believed a true friend

when you love someone you dont have a choice love takes your choices away

augustus i said really you dont have to do this

sure i do he said i found my wish

god youre the best i told him

i bet you say that to all the boys who finance your international travel he answered

at the end of the day its about how much you can bear how much you can endure being together we harm nobody being apart we extinguish ourselves

of course he loves me i’m his sister

blood isn’t love said magnus and his voice was bitter

its one thing to fall in love its another to feel someone else fall in love with you and to feel a responsibility toward that love

i love you enough to never make you choose

its a strange universe he murmured

i love you i whispered

dont say that like youre saying goodbye

but i had to i the soul called wanderer love you human ian and that will never change no matter what i might become i worded it carefully so that there would be no lie in my voice

if i were a dolphin or a bear or a flower it wouldnt matter i would always love you always remember you you will be my only partner

you can live your whole life not realizing that what youre looking for is right in front of you

he loved her of course but better than that he chose her day after day choice that was the thing

i love her and thats the beginning and end of everything

love jo all your days if you choose but dont let it spoil you for its wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you cant have the one you want

the saddest thing about love joe is that not only the love cannot last forever but even the heartbreak is soon forgotten

who knows how to make love stay

tell love you are going to juniors deli on flatbush avenue in brooklyn to pick up a cheesecake and if loves stays it can have half it will stay

wake love up in the middle of the night tell it the world is on fire dash to the bedroom window and pee out of it casually return to bed and assure love that everything is going to be all right fall asleep love will be there in the morning

sometimes we love with nothing more than hope sometimes we cry with everything except tears

…there is the heat of love the pulsing rush of longing the lover’s whisper irresistible—magic to make the sanest man go mad

oh jake brett said we could have had such a damned good time together

ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic he raised his baton the car slowed suddenly pressing brett against me

yes i said isnt it pretty to think so

and yetto say the truth reason and love keep little company together nowadays

once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering

that which god said to the rose and caused it to laugh in fullblown beauty he said to my heart and made it a hundred times more beautiful

with you intimacy colours my voice

even ‘hello’ sounds like ‘come here

oh love isnt there to make us happy i believe it exists to show us how much we can endure

such short little lives our pets have to spend with us and they spend most of it waiting for us to come home each day

it is amazing how much love and laughter they bring into our lives and even how much closer we become with each other because of them

as your lover describes you so you are

so dont you worry your pretty little mind because people throw rocks at things that shine ours

living with him is like being told a perpetual story his mind is the biggest most imaginative i have ever met i could live in its growing countries forever

she smiled and her eyes started to drift downward

back up to his eyes

you know that im falling in love with you right

wait you think im going to die thats why you slept with me

how do you know when its over

maybe when you feel more in love with your memories than with the person standing in front of you

and yet i have had the weakness and have still the weakness to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me heap of ashes that i am into fire

but i have to confess im glad you two had at least a few months of happiness together

im not glad says peeta i wish we had waited until the whole thing was done officially

this takes even caesar aback surely even a brief time is better than no time

maybe id think that too caesar says peeta bitterly if it werent for the baby

the queens pride was his ship and he loved her that was the way his sentences always went it is raining today and i love you my cold is better and i love you say hello to horse and i love you like that

unless you love them and then they can burn it down

he was my north my south my east and west

my working week and my sunday rest

my noon my midnight my talk my song

i thought that love would last forever i was wrong

for it was not into my ear you whispered but into my heart it was not my lips you kissed but my soul

you may choose to look the other way but you can never say again that you did not know

i drive around the streets

an inch away from weeping

ashamed of my sentimentality and

to the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world

ultimately it is the desire not the desired that we love

you were you

and i was i

we were two

before our time

i was yours

before i knew

and you have always

been mine too

one should always be in love thats the reason one should never marry

we’d met at a carefree time a moment full of promise in its place now were the harsh lessons of the real world

i dont think we get a choice in who we fall for ian whispers i think we just do

so i placed my heart under lock and key

to take some time and take care of me

but i turn around and youre standing here

keep love in your heart a life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead the consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring

the court of dreams

if two people love each other there can be no happy end to it

neither love nor evil conquers all but evil cheats more

looking at him noweven if she hadnt been in love with him that part of her that was her mothers daugher that loved every beautiful thing for its beauty alone would still have wanted him

oh lizzy do anything rather than marry without affection

missing someone they say is selfcentered

i selfcenter you more than ever

the way you walk way you talk way you say my name its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change

i carry your heart with mei carry it in my heart

a heart filled with anger has no room for love

dont ever think i fell for you or fell over you i didnt fall in love i rose in it

first best is falling in love second best is being in love least best is falling out of love but any of it is better than never having been in love

if you could only love enough you could be the most powerful person in the world

i do my best thinking at night when everyone else is sleeping no interruptions no noise i like the feeling of being awake when no one else is

each time you happen to me all over again

did you think you could stop me ill burn the world down to save her

lovers and madmen have such seething brains

such shaping fantasies that apprehend

more than cool reason ever comprehends

the lunatic the lover and the poet

are of imagination all compact

one sees more devils than vast hell can hold

that is the madman the lover all as frantic

sees helens beauty in a brow of egypt

the poets eye in fine frenzy rolling

doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven

and as imagination bodies forth

the forms of things unknown the poets pen

turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing

a local habitation and a name

colpo di fulmine the thunderbolt as italians call it when love strikes someone like lightning so powerful and intense it can’t be denied it’s beautiful and messy

cracking a chest open and spilling their soul out for the world to see it turns a person inside out and there’s no going back from it once the thunderbolt hits your life is

and did you get what

you wanted from this life even so

i did

and what did you want

to call myself beloved to feel myself

beloved on the earth

then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place where his affection had rotted away and he could not find it

love is not a maybe thing you know when you love someone

the truest form of love is how you behave toward someone not how you feel about them

and i can fight only for something that i love love only what i respect and respect only what i at least know

your naked body should only belong to those who fall in love with your naked soul

vday…if you need this one day in a year to show everyone else you truly care for your loved one i think it’s quite stupid i hate this commercialism it’s all artificial and has nothing to do with real love

never never never i am never going to forget you

statistically speaking there is a  percent chance that the love of your life is having an affair be very suspicious

there are so many things that demand to be said where did you go do you ever think about me youve ruined me are you okay but of course i cant say any of that

i love you i say

i love you too he says ill see you soon

i love you more than i hate everything else

just because im not forever by your side doesnt mean thats not precisely where i want to be

when someone blushes doesnt that mean yes

any happiness no matter how brief seemed better than the long simmering torture of waking up day after day knowing i could never have him

last night i got up the courage to ask you if you regretted us

there are things i miss you said but if i didnt have you id miss more

i don’t think you ever really fall out of love with someone i think when you fall in love like true love it’s love for life all the rest is just experience and delusions

because this

this is everything

even on my weakest days

i get a little bit stronger

a man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her

to love is to suffer and there can be no love otherwise

most of us must learn to love people and use things rather than loving things and using people

you cannot be with someone just because you don’t want to hurt him you have your own happiness to think about

being with her i feel a pain like a frozen knife stuck in my chest an awful pain but the funny thing is im thankful for it its like that frozen pain and my very existence are one

the pain is an anchor mooring me here

failed relationships can be described as so much wasted makeup

to be brave is to love someone unconditionally without expecting anything in return to just give that takes courage because we dont want to fall on our faces or leave ourselves open to hurt

can officially confirm that the way to a mans heart these days is not through beauty food sex or alluringness of character but merely the ability to seem not very interested in him

she was right about something else too dimitri said after a long pause my back was to him but there was a strange quality to his voice that made me turn around

whats that i asked

that i do still love you

with that one sentence everything in the universe changed

the first time hed held her hand it felt so good that it crowded out all the bad things it felt better than anything had ever hurt

he was contemplation and enthusiasm ambition and strong coffee i could have looked at him forever

true beauty is something that attacks overpowers robs and finally destroys

life is a gift dont forget to live it

and you cant love not fully unless you are loved in return

i am the most miserable person who ever lived he said you are young and in love said primus every young man in your position is the most miserable young man who ever lived

blood of my blood he whispered and bone of my bone you carry me within ye claire and ye canna leave me now no matter what happens you are mine always if ye will it or no if ye want me or nay mine and i wilna let ye go

i seem to have loved you in numberless forms numberless times

in life after life in age after age forever

my spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs

that you take as a gift wear round your neck in your many forms

in life after life in age after age forever

whenever i hear old chronicles of love its age old pain

its ancient tale of being apart or together

as i stare on and on into the past in the end you emerge

clad in the light of a polestar piercing the darkness of time

you become an image of what is remembered forever

you and i have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount

at the heart of time love of one for another

we have played along side millions of lovers

shared in the same shy sweetness of meeting

the distressful tears of farewell

old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever

today it is heaped at your feet it has found its end in you

the love of all mans days both past and forever

the memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours

and the songs of every poet past and forever

it doesnt have to be on valentines day it doesnt have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirtythree or fiftynine it doesnt have to conform to whatever is usual it doesnt have to be kismet at once or rhapsody by the third date

it just has to be in time in place in spirit

it just has to be

the eye through which i see god is the same eye through which god sees me my eye and gods eye are one eye one seeing one knowing one love

if somebody says i love you to me i feel as though i had a pistol pointed at my head what can anybody reply under such conditions but that which the pistol holder requires i love you too

i dont like it when i outweigh my men

his breath hitched and he regarded me hungrily you’re playing with fire you know that

that’s weird considering you’re an ice prin— i didn’t get any further as ash leaned in and kissed me

that’s a woman’s love—it stands the test of time logic and all circumstance

well i’m here to tell you that expecting that kind of love— that perfection—from a man is unrealistic that’s right i said it—it’s not gonna happen no way no how because a man’s

love isn’t like a woman’s love

it is the possibility that keeps me going and though you may call me a dreamer or a fool or any other thing i believe that anything is possible

yes it wasnt over it still isnt over

when you love you wish to do things for you wish to sacrifice for you wish to serve

i want you under me on your back

im sorry you deserve more respect than that but i cant stop thinking of it your arms and legs around me your mouth open for my kisses i need too much of you a lifetime of nights spent between your thighs wouldnt be enough

i want to talk with you forever i remember every word youve ever said to me

if only i could visit you as a foreigner goes into a new country learn the language of you wander past all borders into every private and secret place i would stay forever i would become a citizen of you

and there it stopped

shes mad but shes magic theres no lie in her fire

would he find her

would he save her

a busy vibrant goaloriented woman is so much more attractive than a woman who waits around for a man to validate her existence

love is a striking example of how little reality means to us

i dont want sunbursts or marble halls i just want you

i want you to be weak as weak as i am

i feel like a part of my soul has loved you since the beginning of everything

maybe we’re from the same star

six hundred and forty fish later the only thing i know is everything you love will die the first time you meet someone special you can count on them one day being dead and in the ground

these pictures are my heart and if my heart was a canvas every square inch of it would be painted over with you

i go to sleep alone and wake up alone i take walks i work until im tired i watch the wind play with the trash thats been under the snow all winter everything seems simple until you think about it why is love intensified by abscence

and in the end we were all just humans drunk on the idea that love only love could heal our brokenness

often it is the most deserving people who cannot help loving those who destroy them

love is like a friendship caught on fire in the beginning a flame very pretty often hot and fierce but still only light and flickering as love grows older our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals deepburning and unquenchable

o serpent heart hid with a flowering face

did ever a dragon keep so fair a cave

beautiful tyrant feind angelical dove feather raven wolvishravening lamb despised substance of devinest show just opposite to what thou justly seemest  a dammed saint an honourable villain

surely it was a good way to die in the place of someone else someone i loved

a true gentleman is one that apologizes anyways even though he has not offended a lady intentionally he is in a class all of his own because he knows the value of a womans heart

there is no time for cutanddried monotony there is time for work and time for love that leaves no other time

when you loved someone and had to let them go there will always be that small part of yourself that whispers what was it that you wanted and why didnt you fight for it

love like fire goes out without fuel

ill find you there is no place in this world you can hide from me im watching

the fact is…i’m in love with you and i have been for some time

people die i think but your relationship with them doesnt it continues and is everchanging

like some wines our love could neither mature nor travel

annabeth pressed her lips to percy’s ear i love you

she wasn’t sure he could hear her—but if they died she wanted those to be her last words

he sighed and then focused his eyes right on me it was like drowning drowning in seas of green there was nothing in the world except for those eyes

i want to kiss you rose he said softly and i want you to want me too

i guess what im trying to say is that you are there in everything i am in everything ive ever done and looking back i know that i should have told you know much youve always meant to me

if having a soul means being able to feel love and loyalty and gratitude then animals are better off than a lot of humans

im the kind of boy that can fall in love with any girl because i love with the heart not the eyes

i threw myself into that fire threw myself into it into him and let myself burn

you had to know a person well to make them laugh like that

but maybe you never really had someone she thought now maybe no matter how much you loved them they could slip through your fingers like water and there was nothing you could do about it

if a man hasnt whats necessary to make a woman love him its his fault not hers

so much of the language of love was like that you devoured someone with your eyes you drank in the sight of him you swallowed him whole love was substance broken down and beating through your bloodstream

and yet another moral occurs to me now make love when you can its good for you

thats how you know you love someone i guess when you cant experience anything without wishing the other person were there to see it too

who could refrain

that had a heart to love and in that heart

courage to make love known

but how will i know who my soulmate is brida felt that this was one of the most important questions she had ever asked in her life

by taking risks’ she said to brida ‘ by risking failure disappointment disillusion but never ceasing in you search for love as long as you keep looking you will triumph in the end

i dont care if you say we cant be together i dont care if you think im the most evil unnatural creature walking on earth you can think whatever you want go whatever you want im going to just go on loving you even if its hopeless

youre a hero and a gentleman youre kind and honest but more than that youre the first man i ever truly loved and no matter what the future brings you always will be and i know that my life is better for it

when you feel someone elses pain and joy as powerfully as if it were your own then you know you really loved them

and when all the wars are over a butterfly will still be beautiful

before i wanted to say i found love but now i want to say i found a person and he belongs to me and i belong to him

love is the strongest force the world possesses and yet it is the humblest imaginable

you belong here you know that he says you belong with us itll be over soon so just hold on okay

he scratches behind his ear and looks away like hes embarrassed by what he said

i stare at him i feel my heartbeat everywhere even in my toes i feel like doing something bold but i could just as easily walk away i am not sure which option is smarter or better i am not sure that i care

i reach out and take his hand his fingers slide between mine i cant breathe

i stare up at him and he stares down at me for a long moment we stay that way then i pull my hand away and run after uriah and lynn and marlene maybe now he thinks im stupid or strange maybe it was worth it

marry me kiara he blurts out in front of everyone

why she asks challenging him

i want you any way i can get you not because you’re beautiful or clever or kind or adorable although devil knows you’re all those things i want you because there’s no one else like you and i don’t ever want to start a day without seeing you

there can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love

why is there ever this perverse cruelty in humankind that makes us hurt most those we love best

anyone lived in a pretty how town

with up so floating many bells down

he sang his didnt he danced his did

women and menboth little and small

cared for anyone not at all

they sowed their isnt they reaped their same

children guessedbut only a few

and down they forgot as up they grew

that noone loved him more by more

when by now and tree by leaf

she laughed his joy she cried his grief

bird by snow and stir by still

anyones any was all to her

someones married their everyones

laughed their cryings and did their dance

sleep wake hope and thenthey

said their nevers they slept their dream

and only the snow can begin to explain

how children are apt to forget to remember

with up so floating many bells down

and noone stooped to kiss his face

busy folk buried them side by side

little by little and was by was

all by all and deep by deep

and more by more they dream their sleep

noone and anyone earth by april

wish by spirit and if by yes

women and men both dong and ding

reaped their sowing and went their came

shes my kitten and no one elses

love like rain can nourish from above drenching couples with soaking joy but sometimes under the angry heat of life love dries on the surface and must nourish from below tending to its roots keeping itself alive

love when spelled backwards and read phonetically reads evil

the heart can think of no devotion

greater than being shore to the ocean

holding the curve of one position

counting an endless repetition

and i infinitesima­l being

drunk with the great starry

i felt myself a pure part

of the abyss

i wheeled with the stars

my heart broke loose on the wind

for women the best aphrodisiacs are words the gspot is in the ears he who looks for it below there is wasting his time

some feelings sink so deep into the heart that only loneliness can help you find them again some truths are so painful that only shame can help you live with them some things are so sad that only your soul can do the crying for them

thats when you know for sure somebody loves you they figure out what you need and they give it to you  without you asking

you can obsess and obsess over how things ended—what you did wrong or could have done differently—but theres not much of a point its not like itll change anything so really why worry

love consists of not looking each other in the eye but of looking outwardly in the same direction

now id rather be infected with love for the tiniest sliver of a second than live a hundred years smothered by a lie

you asked why i couldnt forgive you nick said very quietly and i jumped a little it was because you were the love of my life harper and you didnt want to be thats hard to let go

one more secret smile one more shared laugh one more electric kiss finding him was like finding someone i didnt know i was searching for

i desire to be with you i miss you i feel lonely when i cant see you i am obsessed with you fascinated by you infatuated with you i hunger for your taste your smell the feel of your soul touching mine

better to have loved and lost bullshit dont show me paradise and then burn it down

im not really sure why but do you stop loving someone just because they betray you i dont think so thats what makes the betrayal hurt so much  pain frustration anger and i still loved her i still do

hate looks like everybody else until it smiles

but youre the only one scarlet youll always be the only one

and he leans in so carefully breathing

and not breathing and hearts beating

between us and he’s so close he’s so close and i can’t feel my legs anymore i can’t feel my fingers or the cold or the emptiness of this room because all i feel is him everywherefilling everything and he whispers

he says please don’t shoot me for this

and he kisses me

his lips are softer than anything ive ever known soft like a first snowfall like biting into cotton candy like melting and floating and being weightless in water it’s sweet it’s

so effortlessly sweet

and then it changes

he kisses me again this time stronger

he’s breathing like he’s lost his mind andhe’s looking at me like something has brokeninside of him like he’s woken up to find that

his nightmares were just that that they never existed that it was all just a bad dream that felt far too real but now he’s awake and he’s safe and everything is going to be okay and

i’m falling

i’m falling apart and into his heart and i’m a disaster

the simple path

the fruit of service is peace

every normal man must be tempted at times to spit on his hands hoist the black flag and begin slitting throats

we ate well and cheaply and drank well and cheaply and slept well and warm together and loved each other

after all damn it what does being in love mean if you cant trust a person

never give all the heart for love

will hardly seem worth thinking of

to passionate women if it seem

certain and they never dream

that it fades out from kiss to kiss

for everything thats lovely is

but a brief dreamy kind delight

o never give the heart outright

for they for all smooth lips can say

have given their hearts up to the play

and who could play it well enough

if deaf and dumb and blind with love

he that made this knows all the cost

for he gave all his heart and lost

still if we want to avoid the suffering of leaving we will never experience the joy of loving and love is stronger than fear life stronger than death hope stronger than despair we have to trust that the risk of loving is always worth taking

the more loving one

looking up at the stars i know quite well

that for all they care i can go to hell

but on earth indifference is the least

we have to dread from man or beast

how should we like it were stars to burn

with a passion for us we could not return

if equal affection cannot be

let the more loving one be me

admirer as i think i am

of stars that do not give a damn

i cannot now i see them say

i missed one terribly all day

were all stars to disappear or die

i should learn to look at an empty sky

and feel its total dark sublime

though this might take me a little time

if you’re smart you care and if you care you love

when you find love you take it you grab it with both hands and you do everything in your power not to let it go you can’t just walk away from it and expect it to linger until you’re ready for it

she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humor at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men

dont go looking for boys in the dark

they will say pretty things then

leave you with scars

do go looking for boys in the park

for that is where the true gentlemen are

the minute i stopped trying to find the right girl and started trying to become the right guythe girl came

hope for love pray for love wish for love dream for love…but don’t put your life on hold waiting for love

only the united beat of sex and heart together can create ecstasy

if you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same then everything that happens in between can be dealt with

i was dead then alive

weeping then laughing

the power of love came into me

and i became fierce like a lion

then tender like the evening star

there is a desire within each of us

in the deep center of ourselves

that we call our heart

we were born with it

it is never completely satisfied

and it never dies

we are often unaware of it

but it is always awake

it is the human desire for love

every person in this earth yearns to love

to be loved to know love

our true identity our reason for being

is to be found in this desire

love is the why of life

why we are functioning at all

i am convinced

it is the fundamental energy

of the human spirit

the fuel on which we run

the wellspring of our vitality

and grace

which is the flowing

creative activity of love itself

is what makes all goodness possible

love should come first

it should be the beginning of

and the reason for everything

freely we serve

because we freely love as in our will

to love or not in this we stand or fall

the only way love can last a lifetime is if its unconditional the truth is this love is not determined by the one being loved but rather by the one choosing to love

you will never be able to escape from your heart so its better to listen to what it has to say

sex without love is a meaningless experience but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good

everybody is a main character to someone

love is always open arms if you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself

love is a promise love is a souvenir once given never forgotten never let it disappear

you made me feel alive again

it is a defect of gods humor that he directs our hearts everywhere but to those who have a right to them

love must not entreat she added or demand love must have the strength to become certain within itself then it ceases merely to be attracted and begins to attract

falling in love you remain a child rising in love you mature by and by love becomes not a relationship it becomes a state of your being not that you are in love  now you are love

the world is so empty if one thinks only of mountains rivers  cities but to know someone who thinks  feels with us  who though distant is close to us in spirit this makes the earth for us an inhabited garden

i would love to say

that you

weak in the knees

but

to be quite upfront

and completely

you

make my body

it has knees

at all

they send a person who can never stay she whispered who can never accept my offer of companionship for more than a little while they send me a hero i cant help  just the sort of person i cant help falling in love with

as i sailed into the lake i realized the fates really were cruel they sent calypso someone she couldnt help but love but it worked both ways for the rest of my life i would be thinking about her she would always be my biggest what if

dont worry about hurting me if thats what youre afraid of i want to get hurt at least i´ll feel something for a change

if you love someone you must be prepared to set them free

do you believe a man can truly love a woman and constantly betray hernever mind physically but betray her in his mindin the very poetry of his soulwellits not easy but men do it all the time

love is too precious to be ashamed of

how can something so wrong feel so right

you were the missing piece of my soul the breath in my lungs and the blood in my veins

you are the only one who has understood even a whisper of me and i will tell you that i am the only person who has understood even a whisper of you

being in love i find myself smiling for no reason at all

my mother poor fish

wanting to be happy beaten two or three times a

week telling me to be happy henry smile

why dont you ever smile

and then she would smile to show me how and it was the

unrequited love is the infinite curse of a lonely heart

love doesnt mean anything if youre not willing to make a commitment and you have to think not only about what you want but about what he wants not just now but in the future

only time can heal your broken heart just as only time can heal his broken arms and legs

this is part of what a family is about not just love its knowing that your family will be there watching out for you nothing else will give you that not money not fame not work

it is wrong to think that love comes from long companionship and persevering courtship love is the offspring of spiritual affinity and unless that affinity is created in a moment it will not be created for years or even generations

this i want to believe implicitly man was born for love and revolution

i have so much in me and the feeling for her absorbs it all i have so much and without her it all comes to nothing

if you love me as you say you do she whispered make it so that i am at peace

she laced her fingers through his good night she whispered with their hands clasped like children in a fairy tale she fell asleep beside him in the dark

i could never pretend something i didnt feel i could never make love if i didnt love and if i loved i could no more hide the fact than change the color of my eyes

all of sudden this shooting star went by and all i could think was that they were listening to us somehow

sometimes i feel like were a knot too tangled to be taken apart

sometimes people don’t understand

the promises they’re making when they make them i said

isaac shot me a look right of course

but you keep the promise anyway that’s

what love is love is keeping the promise anyway don’t you believe in true love

she had loved him for such a long time she thought how was it that she did now know him at all

what lips my lips have kissed and where and why

i have forgotten and what arms have lain

under my head till morning but the rain

is full of ghosts tonight that tap and sigh

upon the glass and listen for reply

and in my heart there stirs a quiet pain

for unremembered lads that not again

will turn to me at midnight with a cry

thus in the winter stands the lonely tree

nor knows what birds have vanished one by one

yet knows its boughs more silent than before

i cannot say what loves have come and gone

i only know that summer sang in me

a little while that in me sings no more

i knew i loved you before i met you

i think i dreamed you into life

i knew i loved you before i met you

i have been waiting all my life

why are you leaving me

he wrote i do not know how to live

i do not know either but i am trying

i do not know how to try

there were some things i wanted to tell him but i knew they would hurt him so i buried them and let them hurt me

the problem with marriage is that it ends every night after making love and it must be rebuilt every morning before breakfast

when i turn around he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that i dont know who is breathing for who but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey i dont know how long it lasts but when i let go of him i miss it already

we unaccustomed to courage

exiles from delight

until love leaves its high holy temple

and comes into our sight

to liberate us into life

and in its train come ecstasies

yet if we are bold

love strikes away the chains of fear

from our souls

we are weaned from our timidity

in the flush of loves light

we dare be brave

and suddenly we see

that love costs all we are

and will ever be

yet it is only love

which sets us free

the whole world is divided for me into two parts one is she and there is all happiness hope light the other is where she is not and there is dejection and darkness

you know someones right for you when the things they dont have to say are even more important than the things they do

hope is not about proving anything its about choosing to believe this one thing that love is bigger than any grim bleak shit anyone can throw at us

i have always found that actively loving

saves one from a morbid preoccupation

with the shortcomings of society

i’m stuck babysitting turtle eggs while a volleyball player slash grease monkey slash aquarium volunteer tries to hit on me

i’m not hitting on you he protested

no

believe me you’d know if i was hitting on you you wouldn’t be able to stop yourself from succumbing to my charms

he loved her for almost everything she was  she decided that was enough to let him stay for a very long time

you looove me holds out arms you love me this much

i’m here not because i am supposed to be here or because i’m trapped here but because i’d rather be with you than anywhere else in the world

i love the ground under his feet and the air over his head and everything he touches and every word he says i love all his looks and all his actions and him entirely and all together

he looked so lost so soulful so lonely i wanted him to kiss me now i wanted to let him know i was his for all eternity

every time i think im missing a piece of me you give it back

what i cannot love i overlook

i love you a thousand times over and i will never apologize for it

its a strange thing to discover and to believe that you are loved when you know that there is nothing in you for anybody but a parent or a god to love

make me into anything but just love me

if you love someone but rarely make yourself available to him or her that is not true love

love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in dreams

no matter where it is in the sky no matter where you are in the world the moon is never bigger than your thumb john

this time when we kiss i feel it in the pit of my stomach i feel it in my heart and i realize love isnt about sex its about connection

it is better to lose your pride with someone you love rather than to lose that someone you love with your useless pride

the way youre singing in your sleep

the way you look before you leap

the strange illusions that you keep

you dont know

but im noticing

the way your touch turns into arcs

the way you slide into the dark

the beating of my open heart

you dont know

but im noticing

then he was gone

just for that moment the thought that i might never see him again… it felt worse than death i wanted to

run after him tell him anything everything just don’t go please just never go please just always be near me so i can at least see you

i knew it in my bones that this time was it i had finally made my choice and so had he he let me go i was relieved which i expected what i didn’t expect was to feel so much grief

sometimes i get real lonely sleeping with you

if you cannot inspire a woman with love of you fill her above the brim with love of herself  all that runs over will be yours

love is not a habit a commitment or a debt it isnt what romantic songs tell us it is  love simply is

relationships are all about trust and equality if one person shares then the other person should share too

would you mind repeating that im afraid i might have lost my wits altogether and just hallucinated what ive longed to hear

i thought you were gone forever i thought you’d walked away from everything because i failed because i destroyed the only thing that ever mattered to me i waited for you to come but you didn’t

what do i care how e looks i am goodlooking enough for both of us i theenk all these scars show is zat my husband is brave

close your eyes and ill kiss you tomorrow ill miss you

things that matter are not easy feelings of happiness are easy happiness is not flirting is easy love is not saying you’re friends is easy being friends is not

a mighty pain to love it is

and t is a pain that pain to miss

but of all pains the greatest pain

it is to love but love in vain

let us always meet each other with smile for the smile is the beginning of love

when god knows youre ready for the responsibility of commitment hell reveal the right person under the right circumstances

theyve got no idea what happiness is they dont know that without this love there is no happiness or unhappiness for usthere is no life

one of the best times for figuring out who you are  what you really want out of life right after a breakup

the opposite of love is not hate hate is just love gone bad the actual opposite of love is apathy when you dont care a damn as to what happens to the other person

i realized how truly hard it was really to see someone you love change right before your eyes not only is it scary it throws your balance off as well

i am my heart’s undertaker daily i go and retrieve its tattered remains place them delicately into its little coffin and bury it in the depths of my memory only to have to do it all again tomorrow

i crave your mouth your voice your hair

silent and starving i prowl through the streets

bread does not nourish me dawn disrupts me all day

i hunt for the liquid measure of your steps

i will not wait to love as best as i can we thought we were young and that there would be time to love well sometime in the future this is a terrible way to think it is no way to live to wait to love

the moment our lips met i knew with pure and piercing certainty that i would have waited for him forever

we come to love not by finding a perfect person but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly

i choose to love you in silence…

for in silence i find no rejection

i choose to love you in loneliness…

for in loneliness no one owns you but me

i choose to adore you from a distance…

for distance will shield me from pain

i choose to kiss you in the wind…

for the wind is gentler than my lips

i choose to hold you in my dreams…

for in my dreams you have no end

one of the most frustrating words in the human language as far as i could tell was love

so much meaning attached to this one little word people bandied it about freely using it to

describe their attachments to possessions pets vacation destinations and favorite foods in the

same breath they then applied this word to the person they considered most important in their

lives wasn’t that insulting shouldn’t there be some other term to describe deeper emotion

oh lovers be careful in those dangerous first days once youve brought breakfast in bed youll have to bring it forever unless you want to be accused of lovelessness and betrayal

you can love a person dear to you with a human love but an enemy can only be loved with divine love

if love be rough with you be rough with love prick love for pricking and you beat love down

love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy to a friend

absence is to love what wind is to fire it extinguishes the small it inflames the great

tears are words the heart cant express

i think youre still the only person sharp enough to sharpen someone like me

you are the most important thing to me now the most important thing to me ever

i wish i had a boyfriend i wish he lived in the wardrobe on a coat hanger whenever i wanted i could get him out and hed look at me the way boys do in films as if im beautiful

a woman should soften but not weaken a man

loving someone is giving them the power to break your heart but trusting them not to

i prefer the color blue to any other the scent of lilacs in your hair is a source of constant torment i despise figs lastly i will never forget all the days of my life the memories of last night—

for nothing not the sun not the rain not even the brightest star in the darkest sky could begin to compare to the wonder of you

so long as we love we serve so long as we are loved by others i would almost say that we are indispensable and no man is useless while he has a friend

we stood there looking at each other saying nothing but it was the kind of nothing that meant everything in his eyes there was no trace of what had happened between us earlier and i could feel something inside me break

so that was that we were finally finally over

i looked at him and i felt so sad because this thought occurred to me i will never look at you the same way again ill never be that girl again the girl who comes running back every time you push her away the girl who loves you anyway

i couldn’t even be mad at him because this was who he was this was who he’d

always been he’d never lied about that he gave and then he took away i felt it in the pit of my stomach the familiar ache that lost regretful feeling only he could give me i never wanted to feel it again never ever

maybe this was why i came so i could really know so i could say goodbye

i looked at him and i thought if i was very brave or very honest i would tell him

i would say it so he would know it and i would know it and i could never take it back but i wasn’t that brave or honest so all i did was look at him and i think he knew anyway

i release you i evict you from my heart because if i dont do it now i never will

i was the one to look away first

see how she leans her cheek upon her hand

o that i were a glove upon that hand

that i might touch that cheek

but if you love and must needs have desires let these be your desires

to melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night

to know the pain of too much tenderness

to be wounded by your own understanding of love

and to bleed willingly and joyfully

to wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving

to rest at noon hour and meditate loves ecstasy

to return home at eventide with gratitude

and then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise on your lips

absence makes the heart grow fonder but it sure makes the rest of you lonely

love cannot be forced love cannot be coaxed and teased it comes out of heaven unasked and unsought

stronger than lovers love is lovers hate incurable in each the wounds they make

one step as if in a daze

she loosed a shuddering breath and a small whimpering noise came out of her  a sob

and then she was sprinting down the alley flying as though the winds themselves pushed at her heels

she flung herself on the male crashing into him hard enough that anyone else might have gone rocking back into the stone wall

but the male grabbed her to him his massive arms wrapping around her tightly and lifting her up nesryn made to approach but aedion stopped her with a hand on her arm

aelin was laughing as she cried and the male was just holding her his hooded head buried in her neck as if he were breathing her in

who is that nesryn asked

the more boys i meet the more i love my dog

i hug him tightly i can’t imagine my life without you christian i love you so much it frightens me me too he breathes my life would be empty without you i love you so much

in all the world there is no heart for me like yours

in all the world there is no love for you like mine

find your name

and buried treasure

face your life

its pain

its pleasure

leave no path untaken

the words ‘i love you’ kill and resurrect millions in less than a second

someone once wrote that a novel should deliver a series of small astonishments i get the same thing spending an hour with you

whatever happened to the dragon

i mustered my primmest tone he has a name you know

adrian pulled back and gave me a curious look i didnt know actually whatd you decide on

hopper when adrian laughed i added best rabbit ever hed be proud to know his name is being passed on

yes im sure he would did you name the mustang too

i think you mean the ivashkinator

he stared at me in wonder i told you i loved you right

yes i assured him many times

theres no need to wait for the bad things and bullshit to be over change now love now live now dont wait for people to give you permission to live because they wont

do you really think anyone in this world compares to you in my eyes

i mean its not surprising really once you love something you always love it in some way you have to its like part of you for good

its not reasonable to love people who are only going to die she said

nash thought about that for a moment stroking smalls neck with great deliberation as if the fate of the dells depended on that smooth careful movement

yes she whispered

he stroked smalls nose i love you he said even knowing youll never have me and i love my brother more than i ever realized before you came along you cant help whom you love lady nor can you know what its liable to cause you to do

wake up he murmured his deep voice cutting through the layers of the darkness don’t do this if you don’t come out of this soon you’ll fade away and drift forever fight it come back to us

please a hand gripped mine real and solid anchoring me to the present i know what you must think of me but… the voice broke off took a ragged breath don’t leave it whispered meghan don’t go come back to me

love god and he will enable you to love others even when they disappoint you

but beauty is about finding the right fit the most natural fit to be perfect you have to feel perfect about yourself  avoid trying to be something youre not for a goddess thats especially hard we can change so easily

love makes us such fools

he was the toast to her butter

plant seeds of happiness hope success and love it will all come back to you in abundance this is the law of nature

i dont remember who said this but there really are places in the heart you dont even know exist until you love a child

never forget that justice is what love looks like in public

truth without love is brutality and love without truth is hypocrisy

im not married he said softly because i cant stomach the idea of marrying a woman inferior to me in mind and spirit it would mean the death of my soul

that night when you kissed me i left a poem in your mouth and you can hear some of the lines every time you breathe out

looking at beauty in the world is the first step of purifying the mind

the only queer people are those who dont love anybody

those whom we most love are often the most alien to us

you have my whole heart you always did

if you arent the woman i think you are then this isnt the world i thought it was

i dont understand the point of being together if youre not the happiest

there are times when i doubt everything when i regret everything youve taken from me everything ive given you and the waste of all the time ive spent on us

love like rain can nourish from above drenching couples with a soaking joy but sometimes under the angry heat of life love dries on the surface and must nourish from below tending to its roots keeping itself alive

wanting him to come back before anyone notices part of the world has not moved since he left

why darling i dont live at all when im not with you

i think you can only be truly mad at someone you really love

before i fell

in love with words

with setting skies

and singing birds—

it was you i fell

in love with first

it ought to make us feel ashamed when we talk like we know what were talking about when we talk about love

im in love with you and im not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things

i love you not only for what you are but for what i am when i am with you

huh leo said well if you ever get off this island and want a job let me know youre not a total klutz

she smirked a job eh making things in your forge

nah we could start our own shop leo said surprising himself starting a machine shop had always been one of his dreams but hed never told anyone about it leo and calypsos garage auto repair and mechanical monsters

look at me chica when she does i repeat eres hermosa

what does it mean

youre beautiful

love is illogical love had consequencesi did this to myself and i should be able to take it

sometimes two people have to fall apart to realize how much they need to fall back together

i got my hearts desire and there my troubles began

my head’ll explode if i continue with this escapism

albert camus wrote that the only serious question is whether to kill yourself or not

tom robbins wrote that the only serious question is whether time has a beginning and an end

camus clearly got up on the wrong side of bed and robbins must have forgotten to set the alarm

there is only one serious question and that is who knows how to make love stay

answer me that and i will tell you whether or not to kill yourself

everyone always wants to know how you can tell when its true love and the answer is this when the pain doesnt fade and the scars dont heal and its too damned late

sweets to the sweet

stop all the clocks cut off the telephone

prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone

silence the pianos and with muffled drum

bring out the coffin let the mourners come

scribbling on the sky the message he is dead

put crêpe bows round the white necks of the public doves

let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves

he was my north my south my east and west

my working week and my sunday rest

my noon my midnight my talk my song

i thought that love would last for ever i was wrong

the stars are not wanted now put out every one

pack up the moon and dismantle the sun

pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood

for nothing now can ever come to any good

did you mean it that if victor did tellthat youd i couldnt finish i couldnt bring myself to say the words have him killed

i dont have much influence in the upper levels of moroi royalty but i have plenty among the guardians who handle the dirty work in our world

you didnt answer the question if youd really do it

id do a lot of things to protect you roza

can i say something

im a little drunk

me too thats okay

justi missed you you know

i missed you too

but so so much dexter there were so many things i wanted to talk to you about and you werent there

same here

i tell you what it is itswhen i didnt see you i thought about you every day i mean every day in some way or another

same here

you know what happens you have a family your responsibilities change you lose touch with people

it wont be like that i promise

do you

you swear no more disappearing

i wont if you wont

their lips touched now mouths pursed tight their eyes open both of them stock still the moment held a kind of glorious confusion

ah love let us be true

to one another for the world which seems

to lie before us like a land of dreams

so various so beautiful so new

hath really neither joy nor love nor light

nor certitude nor peace nor help for pain

and we are here as on a darkling plain

swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight

where ignorant armies clash by night

every life has one true love snapshot

those we love never truly leave us harry there are things that death cannot touch

i love you i said and stabbed him

two things you will never have to chase true friends  true love

two words three vowels four constenants seven letters it can either cut you open to the core and leave you in ungodly pain or it can free your soul and lift a tremendous weight off you shoulders the phrase is its over

the heart of man is very much like the sea it has its storms it has its tides and in its depths it has its pearls too

the universe is very very big

it also loves a paradox for example it has some extremely strict rules

not you or your family or your house or your planet or the sun it is an absolute rule therefore when someone says that their love will never die it means that their love is not real for everything that is real dies

i want someone who is fierce and will love me until death and knows that love is as strong as death and be on my side forever and ever i want someone who will destroy and be destroyed by me

love is made up of three unconditional properties in equal measure

remove any one of the three and the triangle falls apart

which by the way is something highly inadvisable think about it — do you really want to live in a world of only two dimensions

so for the love of a triangle please keep love whole

i imagine a line a white line painted on the sand and on the ocean from me to you

i love you because no two snowflakes are alike and it is possible if you stand tippytoe to walk between the raindrops

you deserve a lover who wants you disheveled with everything and all the reasons that wake you up in a haste and the demons that won’t let you sleep

you deserve a lover who makes you feel safe who can consume this world whole if he walks hand in hand with you someone who believes that his embraces are a perfect match with your skin

you deserve a lover who wants to dance with you who goes to paradise every time he looks into your eyes and never gets tired of studying your expressions

you deserve a lover who listens when you sing who supports you when you feel shame and respects your freedom who flies with you and isn’t afraid to fall

you deserve a lover who takes away the lies and brings you hope coffee and poetry

i should go i said thickly let me know when you want to start practice again and thanks fortalking

i started to turn then i heard him say abruptly no

i glanced back what

he held my gaze and something warm and wonderful and powerful shot between us

no he repeated i told her no

i i shut my mouth before my jaw hit the floor butwhy that was a onceinalifetime thing you could have had a baby and sheshe was you know into you

the ghost of a smile flickered on his face yes she was is and thats why i had to say no i couldnt return thatcouldnt give her what she wanted not when he took a few steps toward me not when my heart is somewhere else

know that love is truly timeless

you who suffer because you love love still more to die of love is to live by it

even when im dead ill swim through the earth

like a mermaid of the soil just to be next to your bones

jane my little darling so i will call you for so you are you dont know what you are talking about you misjudge me again it is not because she is mad i hate her if you were mad do you think i should hate you

i do indeed sir

she just smiled said that she loved books more than anything and started telling him excitedly what each of the ones in her lap was about and ove realised that he wanted to hear her talking about the things she loved for the rest of his life

people always say that when you love someone nothing in the world matters but thats not true is it you know and i know that when you love someone everything in the world matters a little bit more

i justi just miss him and i hate being so alone

they had an ordinary life full of ordinary thingsif love can ever be called that

and if you couldnt be loved the next best thing was to be let alone

where you go i shall go where you die i shall die and there will i be buried

the heart wants what it wants  or else it does not care

love who you love while you have them thats all you can do let them go when you must if you know how to love youll never run out

god turns you from one feeling to another and teaches by means of opposites so that you will have two wings to fly not one

i know which life is my real one now no matter what happens it’s the one with you for some reason knowing that even one person knows my story makes things different maybe it’s like the poem says maybe this is my way of not going gentle

i love you ky markham

loves gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted

if equal affection cannot be

let the more loving one be me

you get use to someone—start to like them even—and they leave in the end everyone leaves

conquer the angry one by not getting angry conquer the wicked by goodness conquer the stingy by generosity and the liar by speaking the truth

were you always such a stubborn blind obtuse girl

are you calling me stupid

yes but in a more poetic way

well here’s a poem for you get lost

every day people straighten up the hair why not the heart

hate is its too easy love love takes courage

if a writer falls in love with you you can never die

i crossed a thousand leagues to come to you and lost the best part of me along the way dont tell me to leave

jace looked as if she had slapped him why are you determined not to believe us

because she loves you said valentine

clary felt the blood drain out of her face

in itself homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man either a human being without feeling fear restraint or obligation

were all golden sunflowers inside

a weed is but an unloved flower

when you miss someoneit’s weird…your body doesn’t function normallyas it should because i miss you and my heart…it’s not steady…my soul it sings numb fingers are cold…like you…your soul

it was brave countered issa it was rare it was love and it was beautiful

for a long time she held a special place in my heart i kept this special place just for her like a reserved sign on a quiet corner table in a restaurant despite the fact that i was sure id never see her again

i… what are you saying zsadist she stammered even though shed heard every word

he glanced back down at the pencil in his hand and then turned to the table flipping the spiral notebook to a new page he bent way over and labored on top of the paper for quite a while then he ripped the sheet free

his hand was shaking as he held it out its messy

bella took the paper in a childs uneven block letters there were three words i love you

her lips flattened tight as her eyes stung the handwriting got wavy and then disappeared

maybe you cant read it he said in a small voice i can do it over

she shook her head i can read it just fine its… beautiful

i dont expect anything back i mean… i know that you dont… feel that for me anymore but i wanted you to know its important that you knew

five minutes are enough to dream a whole life that is how relative time is

and ill dance with you in vienna

ill be wearing a rivers disguise

the hyacinth wild on my shoulder

my mouth on the dew of your thighs

and ill bury my soul in a scrapbook

with the photographs there and the moss

and ill yield to the flood of your beauty

my cheap violin and my cross

had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly

i come here with no expectations only to profess now that i am at liberty to do so that my heart is and always will beyours

men are driven by two principal impulses either by love or by fear

do you remember all of your audiences marco asks

not all of them celia says but i remember the people who look at me the way you do

what way might that be

as though they cannot decide if they are afraid of me or they want to kiss me

i am not afraid of you marco says

sometimes i sit alone under the stars and think of the galaxies inside my heart and truly wonder if anyone will ever want to make sense of all that i am

cant you just like a girl who likes you back

none of them likes me back i may as well like the one i really want

we rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new but to feel nothing so as not to feel anything—what a waste

all the most powerful emotions come from chaos fearangerlove especially love love is chaos itself think about it love makes no sense it shakes you up and spins you around and then eventually  it falls apart

half the night i waste in sighs

half in dreams i sorrow after

the delight of early skies

in a wakeful dose i sorrow

for the hand the lips the eyes

for the meeting of the morrow

the delight of happy laughter

the delight of low replies

nobody ever gets what they want when it comes to love

wisdom is knowing i am nothing

love is knowing i am everything

and between the two my life moves

but the you who you are tonight is the same you i was in love with yesterday the same you i’ll be in love with tomorrow

one rarely falls in love without being as much attracted to what is interestingly wrong with someone as what is objectively healthy

i think everything that happened in idrisvalentine max hodge even sebastiani kept shoving it all down trying to forget but its catching up with me i ill get help ill get better i promise

you promise

i swear on the angel he ducked his head down kissed her cheek

the hell with that i swear on us

and life definitely doesnt want me

to just let it tell me

that the girl i met

the beautiful amazing strong resilient girl

that i fell so hard for

should only come in third

life is trying to tell ne

that the girl i love

the girl i fell

so hard for

theres room for her in first

im putting her first

not the kind you see in the movies or hear about on the radio

the real kind

the kind that gets beaten down and bloody yet perseveres

the kind that hopes even when hope seems foolish

the kind that can forgive the kind that believes in healing

the kind that can sit in silence and feel renewed

the real kind of love

its rare and we have it

you might be looking for reasons but there are no reasons

don’t take the high ground and assume you already know what you’ll do the truth is when it comes to someone you love you’ll find there isn’t anything you won’t do

i didnt know love could leave the lights on all the time

a friend of mine once defined love as finding someone you can talk to late into the night

your kids require you most of all to love them for who they are not to spend your whole time trying to correct them

but love i’ve come to understand is more than three words mumbled before bedtime love is sustained by action a pattern of devotion in the things we do for each other every day

cut the ending revise the script the man of her dreams is a girl

it’s strange how dreams get under your skin and give your heart a test for what’s real and what’s imaginary

love after love

the time will come

when with elation

you will greet yourself arriving

at your own door in your own mirror

and each will smile at the others welcome

and say sit here eat

you will love again the stranger who was your self

give wine give bread give back your heart

to itself to the stranger who has loved you

all your life whom you ignored

for another who knows you by heart

take down the love letters from the bookshelf

the photographs the desperate notes

peel your own image from the mirror

sit feast on your life

submission is not about authority and it is not obedience it is all about relationships of love and respect

im guilty of giving people more chances than they deserve but when im done im done

would you rather live one perfect day over and over or live your life with no perfect days but just decent ones

most men claim to desire driven independent and confident women yet when confronted with such a creature reverence often evolves into resent for just like women men need to be needed

love is like breathing you take it in and let it out

when it comes to men deal with them as they are not how you’d like them to be

after all my erstwhile dear

my no longer cherished

need we say it was not love

just because it perished

he placed his hands

on my mind

before reaching

for my waist

my hips

or my lips

he didnt call me

he called me

how he touches me

you can’t leave yet i’m not finished falling in love with you

its like im thirteen again and hes my crush all im aware of in this entire roomful of people is him where he is what hes doing who hes talking to

if we’re going to kiss it has to be bookworthy

how could i be sleeping with this particular man surely only true love could justify my lack of taste

i never want to be away from you again except at work in the restroom or when one of us is at a movie the other does not want to see

you cant hurt me the way you think you can but even if you could i would rather die with the taste of you on my tongue than live and never touch you again im in love with you mara i love you no matter what you do

he offered her the world she said she had her own

its so much easier to convince yourself youre madly in love with someone when you know nothing about him

nelly i am heathcliff  hes always always in my mind  not as a pleasure any more then i am always a pleasure to myself  but as my own being

so he called to her back just out of curiosity you know purely conversation and all at what age will you be entertaining offers of marriage

you think itll be so easy she called back over her shoulder no way there will be tasks like in a fairy tale

very so think twice

no need he said youre worth it

i can do pain that’s the easy part of life it’s everything else happiness laughter love that’s fucking complicated

i want someone whose heart is big enough to hold me

want to keep christ in christmas feed the hungry clothe the naked forgive the guilty welcome the unwanted care for the ill love your enemies and do unto others as you would have done unto you

i do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strange

when you like someone you like them in spite of their faults when you love someone you love them with their faults

heart we will forget him

you and i tonight

you must forget the warmth he gave

i will forget the light

you honestly expect me to breathe in a world without air

im backing down now i really do love you thats why im doing this

people wait around too long for love im happy with all of my lusts

whats a fuck when what i want is love

you don’t love because you love despite not for the virtues but despite the faults

it hurts to breathe it hurts to live i hate her yet i do not think i can exist without her

twice i have lived forever in a smile

i dont want to be somebodys crush if somebody likes me i want them to like the real me not what they think i am

love is thicker than forget

more thinner than recall

more seldom than a wave is wet

more frequent than to fail

it is most mad and moonly

and less it shall unbe

than all the sea which only

is deeper than the sea

love is less always than to win

less never than alive

less bigger than the least begin

less littler than forgive

it is most sane and sunly

and more it cannot die

than all the sky which only

is higher than the sky

i have done it she says at first i do not understand but then i see the tomb and the marks she has made on the stone a c h i l l e s it reads and beside it p a t r o c l u s

go she says he waits for you

in the darkness two shadows reaching through the hopeless heavy dusk their hands meet and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun

a kiss on the beach when there is a full moon is the closest thing to heaven

what are you doing

kneeling before a goddess

i’m not a goddess

you are a goddess a princess a queen as a soldier i pledge myself to your service as a prince i grant you any boon within my power as a man i ask to sit at your feet and worship you ask me to do anything for you and i will do it

there are so many men all endlessly attempting to sweep me off my feet and there is one of you trying just the opposite making sure my feet are firm beneath me lest i fall

we are not people who touch each other carelessly every point of contact between us feels important a rush of energy and relief

you remember your first love because they show you prove to you that you can love and be loved that nothing in this world is deserved except for love that love is both how you become a person and why

i have named you queen

there are taller than you taller

there are purer than you purer

there are lovelier than you lovelier

but you are the queen

when you go through the streets

no one recognizes you

no one sees your crystal crown no one looks

at the carpet of red gold

that you tread as you pass

the nonexistent carpet

and when you appear

all the rivers sound

in my body bells

shake the sky

and a hymn fills the world

only you and i

only you and i my love

listen to it

you say you’re sure sure that you’re in love how can you know it you think love is so simple

i have loved you all my life mal i whispered through my tears there is no end to our story

a girl can still admire can’t she even those who can’t afford to go in the store can still windowshop right knowing he wasn’t for me didn’t mean i couldn’t covet the merchandise

im sorry i know you loved her it was hard not to

what if love wasnt the act of finding what you were missing but the giveandtake that made you both match

love is a possible strength in an actual weakness

this time i wouldnt forget him because i couldnt ever forgive him  for breaking my heart twice

it was the nicest thing she could imagine it made her want to have his babies and give him both of her kidneys

i dont think you can define love

its hard to love a woman and do anything

let me love you but dont love me back do love me and let me hate you for a while let me feel like i have some control because i know i never do

physics isnt the most important thing love is

i love you so much that nothing can matter to me  not even youonly my love not your answer not even your indifference

deep in her heart she wasnt sure she deserved to be happy nor did she believe that she was worthy of someone who seemednormal

love which quickly arrests the gentle heart

seized him with my beautiful form

that was taken from me in a manner which still grieves me

love which pardons no beloved from loving

took me so strongly with delight in him

that as you see it still abandons me not

thought i couldnt live without you

its gonna hurt when it heals too

even though i really love you

im gonna smile cause i deserve to

quickly im learning to love again

all i know is imma be ok

i love you in my mind where my thoughts reside in my heart where my emotions live and in my soul where my dreams are born i love you

dont let yourself die without knowing the wonder of fucking with love

there’s something about arriving in new cities wandering empty streets with no destination i will never lose the love for the arriving but im born to leave

knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving when we can be alone we can be with others without using them as a means of escape

the truth was he now belonged only to my past and it was time i begin to accept it as much as it hurt to do so

the right thing at the wrong tme is the wrong thing

you are protected in short by your ability to love

well my music was different in high school i was singing about love—you know things i dont care about anymore

love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame

if you have the woman you love what more do you need well besides an alibi for the time of her husband’s murder

you know that when i hate you it is because i love you to a point of passion that unhinges my soul

my girlfriend is sad and quiet and keeps me up all night worrying about her

youre like a grey sky youre beautiful even though you dont want to be

he showed me his scars and in return he let me pretend that i had none

love is honesty love is a mutual respect for one another

oh its always the same she sighed if you want men to behave well to you you must be beastly to them if you treat them decently they make you suffer for it

i believe in love the verb not the noun

there will never be no love at all

there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart

she did not believe he could have really gone because for her to leave the person you loved was impossible

love like everything else in life should be a discovery an adventure and like most adventures you don’t know you’re having one until you’re right in the middle of it

dogs have given us their absolute all we are the center of their universe we are the focus of their love and faith and trust they serve us in return for scraps it is without a doubt the best deal man has ever made

because isn’t that the point of every relationship to be known by someone else to be understood he gets me she gets me isn’t that the simple magic phrase

i love you and its getting worse

iwill neverregret you

when the world grew bigger and there wasn’t enough string to keep the things people wanted to say from disappearing into the vastness the telephone was invented

sometimes no length of string is long enough to say the thing that needs to be said in such cases all the string can do in whatever its form is conduct a person’s silence

i do not love you except because i love you

i go from loving to not loving you

from waiting to not waiting for you

my heart moves from cold to fire

i love you only because its you the one i love

i hate you deeply and hating you

bend to you and the measure of my changing love for you

is that i do not see you but love you blindly

maybe january light will consume

my heart with its cruel

ray stealing my key to true calm

in this part of the story i am the one who

dies the only one and i will die of love because i love you

because i love you love in fire and blood

the center will hold

how do you know

because we are the center

just because love dont look the way you think it should dont mean you dont have it

the boy in the aglionby sweater leaned his forehead against blues she felt the pressure of his skin against hers and suddenly she could smell mint

itll be okay gansey told the other blue she could tell that he was afraid itll be okay

okay im ready ganseys voice caught just a little blue kiss me

no this trick wont work how on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love

im not crying because of you youre not worth it im crying because my delusion of who you were was shattered by the truth of who you are

follow me reader who told you that there is no true faithful eternal love in this world may the liars vile tongue be cut out follow me my reader and me alone and i will show you such a love

confession is not betrayal what you say or do doesnt matter only feelings matter if they could make me stop loving youthat would be the real betrayal

let me wake up next to you have coffee in the morning and wander through the city with your hand in mine and ill be happy for the rest of my fucked up little life

those who really love you dont mean to hurt you and if they do you cant see it in their eyes but it hurts them too

lover i dont know i dont know if she loves me i dont know if i love her all i can say is shes the one i think about all the time shes the voice i want to hear shes the face i hope to see

i have been loving you a little more every minute since this morning

as the light begins to intensify so does my misery and i wonder how it is possible to hurt so much when nothing is wrong

a best friend is the only one that walks into your life when the world has walked out

love is—a shade of what i feel

someday after mastering the winds the waves the tides and gravity we shall harness for god the energies of love and then for a second time in the history of the world man will have discovered fire

she was bored she loved had capacity to love for love to give and accept love only she tried twice and failed twice to find somebody not just strong enough to deserve it earn it match it but even brave enough to accept it

we are bound together emma bound together—i breathe when you breathe i bleed when you bleed i’m yours and you’re mine you’ve always been mine and i have always always belonged to you

dont marry a rich man marry a good man he will spend his life trying to keep you happy no rich man can buy that

what if i were smiling and running into your arms would you see then what i see now

those who have never known the deep intimacy and the intense companionship of happy mutual love have missed the best thing that life has to give

there are only two reasons why you leave someone youre still in love with  either its the right thing to do or its the only thing to do

learn to deal with the fact that you are not a perfect person but you are a person that deserves respect and honesty

if you love me henry you don’t love me in a way i understand

i dont let nobody see me wishin he was mine

hatred would have been easier with hatred i would have known what to do hatred is clear metallic onehanded unwavering unlike love

when you know my love my love will warm you

i had fun last night i told patch flicking off my chin strap and handing over my helmet im officially in love with your sheets

that the only thing youre in love with

nope your mattress too

some smile crept into patchs eyes my beds an open invitation

well my gun fires seven different shades of shit so whats your favorite color punk

so then i thought id like you to have something to remember me by you know if you ever meet some veela when youre off doing whatever youre doing

i think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground to be honest

we are not held back by the love we didnt receive in the past but by the love were not extending in the present

i need the thing that happens when your brain shuts off and your heart turns on

love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over pinning you underneath at night the ice weasels come

i couldnt stand here hanging on when the very thing i held disappeared more with each passing day

i needed him like id never needed anyone

i would rather a romantic relationship turn into contempt than turn into apathy the passion in the extremities make it appear as though it once meant something we grow from hot or cold but lukewarm is the biggest insult

a warrior does not give up what he loves he finds the love in what he does

the only way of knowing a person is to love them without hope

that’s love two lonely persons keep each other safe and touch each other and talk to each other

we are born in one day we die in one day we can change in one day and we can fall in love in one day anything can happen in just one day

yearning for love made her feel like a cat that was always twining around ankles meowing pet me pet me look at me love me

i never lie i said offhand at least not to those i dont love

they are orphans again with no true home but each other and whatever life they can make together on the other side of the sea

westley this is true love — you think this happens every day

i finally know the difference between pleasing and loving obeying and respecting it has taken me so many years to be okay with being different and with being this alive this intense xxvi

you think that holding someone hard will bring them closer you think that you can hold them so hard that youll still feel them embossed on you when you pull away

every time eleanor pulled away from park she felt the gasping loss of him

and max the king of all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all

so this is for us

this is for us who sing write dance act study run and love

and this is for doing it even if no one will ever know

because the beauty is in the act of doing it

not what it can lead to

this is for the times i lose myself while writing singing playing

and no one is around and they will never know

but i will forever remember

and that shines brighter than any praise or fame or glory i will ever have

and this is for you who write or play or read or sing

by yourself with the light off and door closed

when the world is asleep and the stars are aligned

and maybe no one will ever hear it

or read your words

or know your thoughts

but it doesn’t make it less glorious

it makes it ethereal mysterious

for it belongs to you and whatever god or spirit you believe in

and only you can decide how much it meant

and means

and will forever mean

and other people will experience it too

through you

through your spirit through the way you talk

through the way you walk and love and laugh and care

and i never meant to write this long

but what i want to say is

and let your very existence be your song your poem your story

let your very identity be your book

let the way people say your name sound like the sweetest melody

so go create take photographs in the wood run alone in the rain and sing your heart out high up on a mountain

where no one will ever hear

and your very existence will be the most hypnotising scar

make your life be your art

and you will never be forgotten

because i’ve got a lot more terms of endearment to use honey pie sugarplum bread pudding

why are they all highcalorie foods

if you have it love you dont need to have anything else and if you dont have it it doesnt matter much what else you have

but what was there to say

only that once again they broke the love laws that lay down who should be loved and how and how much

remember the way you make love is the way god will be with you

love is not patronizing and charity isnt about pity it is about love charity and love are the same  with charity you give love so dont just give money but reach out your hand instead

he drew a circle that shut me out

heretic rebel a thing to flout

but love and i had the wit to win

we drew a circle and took him in

must i go bound while you go free

must i love a manwho doesnt love me

must i be born with so little art

as to love a man wholl break my heart

the whole image is that eternal suffering awaits anyone who questions gods infinite love thats the message were brought up with isnt it believe or die thank you forgiving lord for all those options

i think you can love a person too much

so i’m your huntress and thief his hands slid down to cup the backs of my knees as he said with a roguish grin you are my salvation feyre

i cannot compromise my respect for your love you can keep your love i will keep my respect

love cannot live where there is no trust

you can never be wise and be in love at the same time

the old astronomer to his pupil

reach me down my tycho brahe i would know him when we meet

when i share my later science sitting humbly at his feet

he may know the law of all things yet be ignorant of how

we are working to completion working on from then to now

pray remember that i leave you all my theory complete

lacking only certain data for your adding as is meet

and remember men will scorn it tis original and true

and the obloquy of newness may fall bitterly on you

but my pupil as my pupil you have learned the worth of scorn

you have laughed with me at pity we have joyed to be forlorn

what for us are all distractions of mens fellowship and smiles

what for us the goddess pleasure with her meretricious smiles

you may tell that german college that their honor comes too late

but they must not waste repentance on the grizzly savants fate

though my soul may set in darkness it will rise in perfect light

i have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night

what my boy you are not weeping you should save your eyes for sight

you will need them mine observer yet for many another night

i leave none but you my pupil unto whom my plans are known

you have none but me you murmur and i leave you quite alone

well then kiss me  since my mother left her blessing on my brow

there has been a something wanting in my nature until now

i can dimly comprehend it  that i might have been more kind

might have cherished you more wisely as the one i leave behind

i have never failed in kindness no we lived too high for strife

calmest coldness was the error which has crept into our life

but your spirit is untainted i can dedicate you still

to the service of our science you will further it you will

there are certain calculations i should like to make with you

to be sure that your deductions will be logical and true

and remember patience patience is the watchword of a sage

not today nor yet tomorrow can complete a perfect age

i have sown like tycho brahe that a greater man may reap

but if none should do my reaping twill disturb me in my sleep

so be careful and be faithful though like me you leave no name

see my boy that nothing turn you to the mere pursuit of fame

i must say goodbye my pupil for i cannot longer speak

draw the curtain back for venus ere my vision grows too weak

it is strange the pearly planet should look red as fiery mars

god will mercifully guide me on my way amongst the stars

it shattered something inside me that hadnt been broken before

it takes great courage to see the world in all its tainted glory and still to love it and even more courage to see it in the one you love

happiness you see its just an illusion of fate a heavenly sleight of hand designed to make you believe in fairy tales but theres no happily ever after youll only find happy endings in books some books

love those you hate you

there is one friend in the life of each of us who seems not a separate person however dear and beloved but an expansion an interpretation of ones self the very meaning of ones soul

i dont want to know about love

neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius love love love that is the soul of genius

she held up her calloused grimy fingers leo couldnt help thinking there was nothing hotter than a girl who didnt mind getting her hands dirty but of course that was just a general comment didnt apply to calypso obviously

you are not weak you are not indecisive you are strong fierce capable beyond measure

i haven’t been very impressed lately

by people

or places

or the way someone said he loved me and then slowly changed his mind

if love is like a possession maybe my letter are like my exorcisms

a man in love can do extraordinary things i don’t care if you’re an angel you’re my angel and i won’t let you go

a truth should exist

it should not be used

like this if i love you

is that a fact or a weapon

i told him a story of two people two people who shouldnt have met and who didnt like each other much when they did but who found they were the only two people in the world who could possibly have understood each other

men build too many walls and not enough bridges

don’t worry if people think you’re crazy you are crazy you have that kind of intoxicating insanity that lets other people dream outside of the lines and become who they’re destined to be

i am your moon and your moonlight too

i am your flower garden and your water too

i have come all this way eager for you

without shoes or shawl

i want you to laugh

to kill all your worries

to love you

to nourish you

gratitude looks to the past and love to the present fear avarice lust and ambition look ahead

he experienced the singular pleasure of watching people he loved fall in love with other people he loved

i believe in the immeasurable power of love that true love can endure any circumstance and reach across any distance

id like to get away from earth awhile

and then come back to it and begin over

may no fate wilfully misunderstand me

and half grant what i wish and snatch me away

not to return earths the right place for love

i dont know where its likely to go better

i would lay down everything i possess even my soul for you if that isnt love its the best i have

love demands everything they say but my love demands only this that no matter what happens or how long it takes youll keep faith in me youll remember who we are and youll never feel despair

may i kiss you then on this miserable paper i might as well open the window and kiss the night air

pleasetame me he said

i want to very much the little prince replied but i have not much time i have friends to discover and a great many things to understand

what must i do to tame you asked the little prince

and im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

who knows maybe they’re right maybe we are driven crazy by our feelings maybe love is a disease and we would be better off without it

but we have chosen a different road and in the end that is the point of escaping the cure we are free to choose

we are even free to choose the wrong thing

you are afraid of it because it is stronger than you you hate it because you are afraid of it you love it because you cannot subdue it to your will only the unsubduable can be loved

we separate

when someone beats a rug

the blows are not against the rug

but against the dust in it

millions of people are suffering they want to be loved but they dont know how to love and love cannot exist as a monologue it is a dialogue a very harmonious dialogue

perfect love is the most beautiful of all frustrations because it is more than one can express

ill be your family now he says

i love you i say

he stares at me i wait with my hands clutching his arms for stability as he considers his response

he frowns at me say it again

tobias i say i love you

you have to take a deep breath and allow the music to flow through you revel in it allow yourself to awe when you play allow the music to break your heart with its beauty

love is forgiving accepting moving on embracing and all encompassing and if you’re not doing that for yourself you cannot do that with anyone else

i delete the picture of him from my phone i delete his number i think that if i just delete him enough it will be like none of it ever happened and my heart wont hurt so badly

when you arise in the morning think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive—to breathe to think to enjoy to love—then make that day count

if love is blind then maybe a blind person that loves has a greater understanding of it

i wanted to be his life preserver the thing that would keep him afloat instead he became my anchor and i’m tired of drowning

sometimes no matter how many eyelashes or dandelion seeds you blow no matter how much of your heart you tear out and slap on your sleeve it just aint gonna happen

she was the kind of girlfriend god gives you young so youll know loss the rest of your life

i just looked at her feeling utterly empty i didn’t know what i was supposed to say to her my life is in that bed please let me stay

but why why why cant people just say what they mean

when you fish for love bait with your heart not your brain

love me like youll never see me again

if it werent for music i would think that love is mortal

he was too perfect despite being one of the most imperfect people i knew

i want you to know

you know how this is

if i look

at the crystal moon at the red branch

of the slow autumn at my window

if i touch

near the fire

the impalpable ash

or the wrinkled body of the log

everything carries me to you

as if everything that exists

were little boats

that sail

toward those isles of yours that wait for me

well now

if little by little you stop loving me

i shall stop loving you little by little

if suddenly

you forget me

do not look for me

for i shall already have forgotten you

if you think it long and mad

the wind of banners

that passes through my life

and you decide

to leave me at the shore

of the heart where i have roots

that on that day

at that hour

i shall lift my arms

and my roots will set off

to seek another land

but

if each day

each hour

you feel that you are destined for me

with implacable sweetness

if each day a flower

climbs up to your lips to seek me

ah my love ah my own

in me all that fire is repeated

in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten

my love feeds on your love beloved

and as long as you live it will be in your arms

love whether newly born or aroused from a deathlike slumber must always create sunshine filling the heart so full of radiance that it overflows upon the outward world

is it really so that the one i love is everywhere

depression is the flaw in love to be creatures who love we must be creatures who can despair at what we lose and depression is the mechanism of that despair

life is short from here to that old car you know so well there is a stretch of twenty twentyfive paces it is a very short walk make those twentyfive steps now right now come just as you are and we shall live happily ever after

hes around the twist said azalea breaking all the windows hes mad

ah no said the king its only madness if you actually do it if you want to break all the windows in the house and drown yourself in a bucket but dont actually do it well thats love

you have made a place in my heart where i thought there was no room for anything else you have made flowers grow where i cultivated dust and stones remember this on this journey you insist on making if you die i will not survive you long

the fire of brigans heart was astounding fire understood and almost could not believe that the feeling he was sending her was love

i want you to be the one wanting me first pushing me first kissing me first dont be careful with me he said because i wont be careful with you

we shouldnt teach great books we should teach a love of reading knowing the contents of a few works of literature is a trivial achievement being inclined to go on reading is a great achievement

dont be reckless with other peoples hearts dont put up with people who are reckless with yours

to wish was to hope and to hope was to expect

love takes off the masks we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within

and the story of love is a long sad tale ending in graves

this thing about you that you think is your flaw  its the reason im falling in love with you

sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together

she didnt need to understand the meaning of life it was enough to find someone who did and then fall asleep in his arms and sleep as a child sleeps knowing that someone stronger than you is protecting you from all evil and all danger

whoever loves becomes humble those who love have  so to speak  pawned a part of their narcissism

we are asleep until we fall in love

when you were in love you were capable of learning everything and of knowing things you had never dared even to think because love was the key to understanding all of the mysteries

what is love two souls and one flesh friendship two bodies and one soul

nothing else wounds so deeply and irreparably nothing else robs us of hope so much as being unloved by one we love

if youre not comfortable enough with yourself or with your own truth when entering a relationship then youre not ready for that relationship

love is the most powerful force in the world that love can do anything

cant you see every step i have taken since i was that child on the bridge has been to bring myself closer to you

ever since time began people have recognized their true love by the light in their eyes

it is also not being able to remove the smile from your face loving life with a mad passionate intensity and feeling ten years younger

where is aelin

where is my wife

he was afraid of defiling the love which filled his soul

people do the damndest things when they’re in love

love is a combination of care commitment knowledge responsibility respect and trust

i believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear

maybe its only fitting that relationship that started with a lie would end with one

a slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech then ron said one person cant feel all that at once theyd explode

i am not a believer in love at first sight for love in its truest form is not the thing

of starryeyed or starcrossed lovers it is far more organic requiring nurturing and time

to fully bloom and as such seen best not in its callow youth but in its wrinkled maturity

like all living things love too struggles against hardship and in the process sheds

its fatuous skin to expose one composed of more than just a storm of emotion–one of loyalty

and divine friendship agape and though it may be temporarily blinded by adversity

it never gives in or up holding tight to lofty ideals that transcend this earth and

time–while its counterfeit simply concludes it was mistaken and quickly runs off to

find the next real thing

i do not know what it is about you that closes

and opensonly something in me understands

the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses

you can give without loving but you cannot love without giving

i am troubled immeasurably

by your eyes

i am struck by the feather

of your soft reply

the sound of glass

and conceals

what your eyes fight

to explain

making love to me is amazing wait i meant making love to me is amazing the absence of two little commas nearly transformed me into a sex god

how could you go about choosing something that would hold the half of your heart you had to bury

the first stab of love is like a sunset a blaze of color  oranges pearly pinks vibrant purples

define yourself radically as one beloved by god this is the true self every other identity is illusion

love is hard to find hard to keep and hard to forget

my shoulder will never be the same i expect you to nurse me back to health

so many days oh so many days

seeing you so tangible and so close

how do i pay with what do i pay

the bloodthirsty spring

has awakened in the woods

the foxes start from their earths

the serpents drink the dew

and i go with you in the leaves

between the pines and the silence

asking myself how and when

i will have to pay for my luck

of everything i have seen

its you i want to go on seeing

of everything ive touched

its your flesh i want to go on touching

i love your orange laughter

i am moved by the sight of you sleeping

what am i to do love loved one

i dont know how others love

or how people loved in the past

i live watching you loving you

being in love is my nature

you please me more each afternoon

where is she i keep on asking

if your eyes disappear

how long shes taking i think and im hurt

i feel poor foolish and sad

and you arrive and you are lightning

glancing off the peach trees

thats why i love you and yet not why

there are so many reasons and yet so few

for love has to be so

involving and general

particular and terrifying

joyful and grieving

flowering like the stars

and measureless as a kiss

thats why i love you and yet not why

there are so many reasons and yet so few

for love has to be so

involving and general

particular and terrifying

joyful and grieving

flowering like the stars

and measureless as a kiss

when you give yourself permission to communicate what matters to you in every situation you will have peace despite rejection or disapproval putting a voice to your soul helps you to let go of the negative energy of fear and regret

be worthy love and love will come

he is ugly and sad but he is all love

thus with my lips have i denounced you while my heart bleeding within me called you tender names

it was love lashed by its own self that spoke it was pride half slain that fluttered in the dust it was my hunger for your love that raged from the housetop while my own love kneeling in silence prayed your forgiveness

i was trying to make you jealous simon screamed right back his hands were fisted at his sides youre so stupid clary youre so stupid cant you see anything

she stared at him in bewilderment what on earth did he mean trying to make me jealous why would you try to do that

she saw immediately that this was the worst thing she could have asked him

because he said so bitterly that it shocked her ive been in love with you for ten years so i thought it seemed like the time to find out whether you felt the same about me which i guess you dont

better than chocolate being with you last night silly me i thought that nothing was better than chocolate

i know what it is to live entirely for and with what i love best on earth i hold myself supremely blest  blest beyond what language can express because i am my husbands life as fully as he is mine

like the fact that the person sirius cared for the most about in the world was you said dumbledore quietly

love is a state in which a man sees things most decidedly as they are not

if i had a camera i said id take a picture of you every day that way id remember how you looked every single day of your life

loveno such thing

whatever it is that binds families and married couples together thats not love thats stupidity or selfishness or fear love doesnt exist

self interest exists attachment based on personal gain exists complacency exists but not love love has to be reinvented that’s certain

may you live as long as you wish and love as long as you live

sometimes i wonder if my heart is like a black holeits so dense that theres no room for light but that doesnt mean it cant still suck me in

it reminds me that no embrace will ever feel the same again because no one will ever be like her again because shes gone shes gone and crying feels so useless so stupid but its all i can do

popular culture is a place where pity is called compassion flattery is called love propaganda is called knowledge tension is called peace gossip is called news and autotune is called singing

the end of a relationship is not always a failure sometimes all the love in the world is not enough to save something in these cases it is not a matter of fault from either person some things cannot be its as simple as that

nice costume he said

ditto i can tell you put a lot of thought into yours

amusement curled his mouth if you dont like it i can take it off

i felt silly for even mentioning it but once i did i knew i had to explain

for a moment you were quiet and then you nestled in and whispered

and i knew you understood

it was the moment i realized what music can do to people how it can make you hurt and feel so good all at once

love is so unpredictable thats what makes it so great

love the trees until their leaves fall off then encourage them to try again next year

in love one and one are one

this love of which i speak is slow to lose patience  it looks for a way of being constructive

love is not possessive

love is not anxious to impress nor does it cherish inflated ideas of its own ideas

love has good manners and does not pursue selfish advantage

love is not touchy

love does not keep account of evil or gloat over the wickedness of other people on the contrary it is glad with all good men when truth prevails

love knows no limits to its endurance no end to its trust no fading of its hope it can outlast anything it is in fact the one thing that stands when all else has fallen

do you like me

no answer

silence bounced fell off his tongue

and sat between us

and clogged my throat

it slaughtered my trust

it tore cigarettes out of my mouth

we exchanged blind words

and i did not cry

i did not beg

but blackness filled my ears

blackness lunged in my heart

and something that had been good

turned into a gas oven

no matter what nobody can take away the dances youve already had

remember how it was when we kissed armfuls and armfuls of light thrown right at us a rope dropping down from the sky how can the word love and the word life even fit in the mouth

my point is that love is the most powerful motivator in the world it spurs mortals to greatness their noblest bravest acts are done for love

why is the measure of love loss

despite the mayhem that followed bruno found that he was still holding shmuels hand in his own and nothing in the world would have persuaded him to let go

your absence has not taught me to be alone it merely has shown that when together we cast a single shadow on the wall

no man is offended by another mans admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment

waiting for you is like waiting for rain in this drought useless and disappointing  sam hilary duff a cinderella story

i am two fools i know

for loving and for saying so

she loved him but he didn’t know how to love

he could talk about love he could see love and feel love but he couldn’t give love

he could make love but he couldn’t make promises

she had desperately wanted his promises

she wanted his heart knew she couldn’t have it so she took what she could get

temporary bliss passionate highs and lows withdrawal and manipulation

he only stayed long enough to take what he needed and keep moving

if he stopped moving he would selfdestruct

if he stopped wandering he would have to face himself

he chose to stay in the dark where he couldn’t see

if he exposed himself and the sun came out he’d see his shadow

he was deathly afraid of his shadow

she saw his shadow loved it understood it saw potential in it

she thought her love would change him

he pushed and he pulled tested boundaries thinking she would never leave

he knew he was hurting her but didn’t know how to share anything but pain

he was only comfortable in chaos claiming souls before they could claim him

her love her body she had given to him and he’d taken with such feigned sincerity absorbing every drop of her

his dark heart concealed

she’d let him enter her spirit and stroke her soul where everything is love and sensation and surrender

wide open exposed to deception

it had never occurred to her that this desire was not love

it was blinding the way she wanted him

she couldn’t see what was really happening only what she wanted to happen

she suspected that he would always seek to minimize the risk of being split open his secrets revealed

he valued his soul’s privacy far more than he valued the intimacy of sincere connection so he kept his distance at any and all costs

intimacy would lead to his undoing—in his mind an irrational and indulgent mistake

when she discovered his indiscretions she threw love in his face and beat him with it

somewhere deep down in her labyrinth her intricacy the darkest part of her soul she relished the mayhem

she felt a sense of privilege for having such passion in her life

he stirred her core

the place she dared not enter

the place she could not stir for herself

but something wasn’t right

his eyes were cold and dark

his energy unaffected

he laughed at her and her antics told her she was a mess

frantic she looked for love hiding in his eyes in his face in his stance and she found nothing but disdain

and her heart stopped

who said

i cant wear my converse

with my dress well baby

thats just me

if you press me to say why i loved him i can say no more than because he was he and i was i

friendship is selfless love care respect and honor not a profitable opportunity

i never understood why anyone would have sex on the floor until i was with you and i realized you dont ever realize youre on the floor

zen masters say you cannot see your reflection in running water only in still water

he smiles at me and i am suddenly seventeen again  the year i realize that love doesnt follow the rules the year i understood that nothing is worth having so much as something unattainable

you are my butterfly and refuse to set you free

my love is pizza shaped won’t you have a slice it’s circular so there’s enough to go around

dance smile giggle marvel trust hope love wish believe most of all enjoy every moment of the journey and appreciate where you are at this moment instead of always focusing on how far you have to go

i wore your promise on my finger for one year

ill wear your name on my heart til i die

because you were my boy you were my only boy forever

for she had eyes and chose me

love is the sum of our choices the strength of our commitments the ties that bind us together

i love the lord for he heard my voice he heard my cry for mercy because he turned his ear to me i will call on him as long as i live psalms  niv

tell me then does love make one a fool or do only fools fall in love

do people look the same when they go to heaven mommy

i dont know i dont think so

then how do people recognize each other

i dont know sweetie they just feel it you dont need your eyes to love right

i love you not only for what you are but for what i am when i am with you i love you not only for what you have made of yourself but for what you are making of me i love you for the part of me that you bring out

none of us can choose where we shall love

remembering forgetting im not sure which is worse

they said that love was terrifying and tender wild and sweet and none of it made any sense

but now i knew that every mad word was true

right now we are here and nothing can mar our perfection or steal the joy of this perfect moment

lovings pretty easy its letting someone love you thats hard

she imagines him imagining her this is her salvation

he promised her that he would give her everything everything she wanted as men in love always do and she trusted him despite herself as women in love always do

but everyone disappears no matter who loves them

id rather die on my own terms than live on theirs id rather die loving alex than live without him

his noise is getting quieter but i can still see it there still

oh god he says looking away suddenly viola im sorry i didnt mean

but i just put my hand to the back of his neck

and he says viola

and i pull myself towards him

and i kiss him

and it feels like finally

i want to be the best version of myself for anyone who is going to someday walk into my life and need someone to love them beyond reason

you didn’t think i’d let you go alone did you

no but i’m grateful that i had you with me

grateful is all i’m going to get isn’t it

what else were you hoping for

adoration devotion affection infatuation or just plain finding me irresistible

sorry don juan you’ll have to live with my undying gratitude

you will be the first test subject tobias beatrice however she smiles you are too injured to be of much use to me so your execution will occur at the conclusion of this meeting

i try to hide the shudder that goes through me at the word execution my shoulder screaming with pain and look up at tobias its hard to blink tears back when i see the terror in tobiass wide dark eyes

no says tobias his voice trembles but his look stern as he shakes his head i would rather die

im afraid you dont have much of a choice in that matter replies jeanine lightly

everyone has choices to make no one has the right to take those choices away from us not even out of love

my father gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person he believed in me

that kind of love shouldve been able to beat sickness that kind of love shouldve conquered anything

it matters not who you love where you love why you love when you love or how you love it matters only that you love

the most confused you will ever get is when you try to convince your heart and spirit of something your mind knows is a lie

for there is no friend like a sister

in calm or stormy weather

to cheer one on the tedious way

to fetch one if one goes astray

to lift one if one totters down

fight for the only thing she knew was good enough noble enough powerful enough to be worth risking everything love

true friends are those who came into your life saw the most negative part of you but are not ready to leave you no matter how contagious you are to them

hearts live by being wounded

he felt now that he was not simply close to her but that he did not know where he ended and she began

the more you are motivated by love

the more fearless  free your action will be

turning your back on

if you love it

the language of love letters is the same as suicide notes

eternity is in love with the productions of time

love is illogical you fall into it like a manhole then youre just stuck you die in love more than you live in love

when forever becomes a placewhen forever ceases to be just a word… when it ceases to be just a measurement of time…but instead becomes a place where soul mates can dance to the song in their hearts that is a reflection of true love

you know that i could as soon forget you as my existence

almost all the time you tell yourself youre loving somebody when youre just using them

this only looks like love

everything i know i know because of love

love as thou wilt

the fiercest anger of all the most incurable

is that which rages in the place of dearest love

well its simple to love someone she said but its hard to know when you need to say it out loud

and then i opened my eyes and it was just grace and me  nothing anywhere but grace and me  she pressing her lips together as though she were keeping my kiss inside her and me holding this moment that was as fragile as a bird in my hands

the worst thing to give yourself away in exchange for not enough love

it was as if when i looked into his eyes i was standing alone on the edge of the worldon a windswept ocean beach there was nothing but the soft roar of the waves

my mother did not choose a leaf or a head she chose my father and to hold on to a certain feeling she sacrificed the world

i havent had that one great love which is good i dont want that to be in the past i want it to be in the future

i knew you would do me good in some way at some time i saw it in your eyes when i first beheld you their expression and smile did not again he stopped did not he proceeded hastily strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing

some girls are full of heartache and poetry and those are the kind of girls who try to save wolves instead of running away from them

no reason i like my ladies with a pulse

ive been saying it so long to you you just wouldnt listen every time you said farm boy do this you thought i was answering as you wish but thats only because you were hearing wrong i love you was what it was but you never heard

love is not blind that is the last thing that it is love is bound and the more it is bound the less it is blind

let me tell ya you gotta pay attention to signs when life reaches out with a moment like this its a sin if you dont reach back im telling you

depression isnt a war you win its a battle you fight every day you never stop never get to rest its one bloody fray after another

but my god its so beautiful when the boy smiles

and maybe that was love being so vulnerable and allowing someone else in so far they could hurt you but they also give you everything

their fingers seemed to fit together in just the right way effortlessly claspedlike perfect complements

that’s what it feels like when you touch me like millions of tiny universes being born and then dying in the space between your finger and my skin sometimes i forget

people who love themselves don’t hurt other people the more we hate ourselves the more we want others to suffer

its not enough to believe dont you see that you stupid girl you could spend your whole life hoping and believing if a love affair is onesided then its only ever a question never an answer you cant live your life waiting for an answer

i am no king and i am no lord

and i am no soldier atarms said he

im none but a harper and a very poor harper

that am come hither to wed with ye

if you were a lord you should be my lord

and the same if you were a thief said she

and if you are a harper you shall be my harper

for it makes no matter to me to me

for it makes no matter to me

but what if it prove that i am no harper

that i lied for your love most monstrously

why then ill teach you to play and sing

for i dearly love a good harp said she

love the sickest of irony’s sick jokes the place where logic and order go to die

a the soul wanders in the dark until it finds love and so wherever our love goes there we find our soul

q it always happens

a if were lucky and if we let ourselves be blind

q instead of watching out

a instead of always watching out

we live in a dark and romantic and quite tragic world

ive been lonely for so long and ive been hurt so deeply if only i could have met you again a long time ago then i wouldnt have had to take all these detours to get here

tengo shook his head i dont think so this way is just fine this is exactly the right time for both of us  we needed that much time to understand how lonely we really were

there are some experiences in life they havent invented the right words for

i feel like i’ve been split open and stuffed with sunshine

no matter how bad your heart is broken the world doesnt stop for your grief

time has no meaning

love will endure

growth in love comes from a place of absence where the imagination is left to it’s own devices and creates you to be much more then reality would ever allow

one can be very much in love with a woman without wishing to spend the rest of ones life with her

we wanted the freedom to love we wanted the freedom to choose now we have to fight for it

but no matter what love throws at you you have to believe in it you have ot believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily ever after thats why i write these songs because i think love is fearless

i love you more i love you enough to let you go and live your dream i tilted my head and shrugged dont you see i love you more

stubbornly he shook his head no i know that i have to be with you everything else is just  details

i’m a fake fact factory the things i make are the things i make up also as a side business i make love actually i just made that up

the opposite of love is not hate  its apathy its not giving a damn if somebody hates me they must feel something  or they couldnt possibly hate therefore theres some way in which i can get to them

i had to touch you with my hands i had to taste you with my tongue one cant love and do nothing

she was bendable light she shone around every corner of my day

whats your heart telling you to do

i dont know

maybe youre trying too hard to hear it

all the problem of women starts with men all the problem of men ends with women

my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun

coral is far more red than her lips red

if snow be white why then her breasts are dun

if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head

i have seen roses damaskd red and white

but no such roses see i in her cheeks

and in some perfumes is there more delight

than in the breath that from my mistress reeks

i love to hear her speak yet well i know

that music hath a far more pleasing sound

i grant i never saw a goddess go

my mistress when she walks treads on the ground

and yet by heaven i think my love as rare

as any she belied with false compare

in fairy tales the princesses kiss the frogs and the frogs become princes in real life the pricesses kiss princes and the princes turn into frogs

i close my eyes thinking that there is nothing like an embrace after an absence nothing like fitting my face into the curve of his shoulder and filling my lungs with the scent of him

love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved it finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being his inner self whether or not he is actually present whether or not he is still alive at all ceases somehow to be of importance

it seems to me now that the plain state of being human is dramatic enough for anyone you dont need to be a heroin addict or a performance poet to experience extremity you just have to love someone

but whatever

whenever this ends i want you to know

that right now

i love you forever

i love you marks my heart is completely and utterly yours and unfortunately for you the rest of me comes with it

i’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell

to die upon the hand i love so well

sensitive people usually love deeply and hate deeply they dont know any other way to live than by extremes because thier emotional theromastat is broken

he opened his eyes and stared up at me as if i were the door out of arcadia and back to the true sky thats what makes you my favorite he reached up and wiped a tear off my cheek with his thumb every wicked bit of you

perhaps all romance is like that not a contract between equal parties but an explosion of dreams and desires that can find no outlet in everyday life only a drama will do and while the fireworks last the sky is a different colour

love is not finding someone to live with its finding someone you cant live without

find the things that matter and hold on to them and fight for them and refuse to let them go

i would never let anyone else borrow my heart if i know there’s a chance in hell you might want it back

loving you was like going to war i never came back the same

its easy to look back and see it and its easy to give the advice but the sad fact is most people dont look beneath the surface until its too late

it is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself

than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all

connected with you

when someone you love says goodbye you can stare long and hard at the door they closed and forget to see all the doors god has open in front of you

i make love with a focus and intensity that most people reserve for sleep

but hurry lets entwine ourselves as one our mouth broken our soul bitten by love so time discovers us safely destroyed

nothing had changed i was the stupid one again i was the girl who never understood who she was to people

ones life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others by means of love friendship and compassion

he must love you very much gavril said once i had my footing

i couldnt look at him what makes you say that gavril sighed ive known maxon since he was a child hes never stood up to his father like that

love is a drama of contradictions

he’s dozed off again but i kiss him awake which seems to startle him then he smiles as if he’d be happy to lie there gazing at me forever

the problem of course was that he saw the world in black and white and he got to decide what was black and what was white you cant love a person who lives that way without fearing him too maybe even hating him a little

love may forgive all infirmities and love still in spite of them but love cannot cease to will their removal

we all have an old knot in the heart we wish to untie

you smiled and talked to me of nothing and i felt that for this i had been waiting long

friendship often ends in love but love in friendship never

when i first met you thats what i remember i looked up at the sky and thought im going to love this person because even the sky looks different

love is an endless mystery because there is no reasonable cause that could explain it

thats what i love about aibileen she can take the most complicated things in life and wrap them up so small and simple theyll fit right in your pocket

im like a starving man who has been given food maybe hes cold and his clothes are torn and hes ashamed but hes not unhappy

smirking he says whatever spell you just tried to cast on me it didnt work so i think you need to go back to hogwarts

i have such a fear of finding another like myself and such a desire to find one i am so utterly lonely but i also have such a fear that my isolation be broken through and i no longer be the head and ruler of my universe

do people always fall in love with things they cant have

always carol said smiling too

he tells me to pick the music i’m not sure if he knows that handing me his ipod is like handing me the window to his soul

you dumbass i crooned kissing her on the forehead you dont share me you own me

and when love came to us twice

and lied to us twice

we decided to never love again

that was fair

fair to us

and fair to love itself

we ask for no mercy or no

we are strong enough to live

and to die and to

attend the boxing matches go to the racetrack

live on luck and skill

and if you cant sleep alone

be careful of the words you speak in your sleep

and

ask for no mercy

no miracles

and dont forget

time is meant to be wasted

and death is useless

you’re in my every breath and every thought intertwined so deep inside me that love’s not a strong enough word—you have my devotion your name branded on my soul my wolf yours to command a hundred years it’ll never be enough i want eternity

the thing with your hearts desire is that your heart doesnt even know what it desires until it turns up

real friendship or love is not manufactured or achieved by an act of will or intention friendship is always an act of recognition

americans are forever searching for love in forms it never takes in places it can never be it must have something to do with the vanished frontier

the worst thing you can do if you miss or need someone is let them know it

desire is the kind of thing that

eats you

and

leaves you starving

not enough he said letting her hair slip through his fingers if i kiss you all day everyday for the rest of my life it wont be enough

touchstone watched suddenly conscious that he probably only had five seconds left to be alone with sabriel to say something to say anything perhaps the last five seconds they ever would have alone together

i am not afraid he said to himself

i love you he whispered i hope you dont mind

love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning

they say if a man knew himself

he would know all mankind

i say if a man loved mankind

he would know something of himself

could it be that the heart that you seek is no longer my own i have given my heart to another

the boy the one in the inn with the unicorn

you should have let me take it back then for my sisters and me we could have been young again well into the next age of the world your boy will break it or waste it or lose it they all do

nonetheless he has my heart i hope your sisters will not be too hard on you when you return to them without it

you dont know when youre twentythree

she didnt know at twentythree

love comes with a knife not some shy question and not with fears for its reputation

in a universe of ambiguity this kind of certainty comes only once and never again no matter how many lifetimes you live

i think heaven will be like a first kiss

sometimes your heart is the only thing worth listening to

chiron had said once that nations were the most foolish of mortal inventions no man is worth more than another wherever he is from

but what if he is your friend achilles had asked him feet kicked up on the wall of the rosequartz cave or your brother should you treat him the same as a stranger

you ask a question that philosophers argue over chiron had said he is worth more to you perhaps but the stranger is someone else’s friend and brother so which life is more important

we had been silent we were fourteen and these things were too hard for us now that we are twentyseven they still feel too hard

he is half of my soul as the poets say he will be dead soon and his honor is all that will remain it is his child his dearest self should i reproach him for it i have saved briseis i cannot save them all

i know now how i would answer chiron i would say there is no answer whichever you choose you are wrong

i always think of each night as a song or each moment as a song but now im seeing we dont live in a single song we move from song to song from lyric to lyric from chord to chord there is no ending here its an infinite playlist

the greatest thing youll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return

to fall in love is easy even to remain in it is not difficult our human loneliness is cause enough but it is a hard quest worth making to find a comrade through whose steady presence one becomes steadily the person one desires to be

there has to be a moment at the beginning where you wonder whether you’re in love with the person or in love with the feeling of love itself

if the moment doesn’t pass that’s it—you’re done

and if the moment does pass it never goes that far it stands in the distance ready for whenever you want it back sometimes it’s even there when you thought you were searching for something else like an escape route or your lovers’ face

for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me

her heart had grown so familiar to the pain of life without him that to respond now seemed too large a pleasure she could not endure if pain was love then she loved fiercely yet knew she could not be near that boy again

i dont ask you to love me always like this but i ask you to remember somewhere inside me therell always be the person i am tonight

before i go he said and paused  i may kiss her

love lasts about seven years thats how long it takes for the cells of the body to totally replace themselves

what a terrible feeling to love soemone and not be able to help them

don’t let mental blocks control you set yourself free confront your fear and turn the mental blocks into building blocks

you had to be willing to fight in order for a love story to last a life time

if someone does not want me it is not the end of the world but if i do not want me the world is nothing but endings

stains are even worse when youre the only one who can see them

marius and cosette were in the dark in regard to each other they did not speak they did not bow they were not acquainted they saw each other and like the stars in the sky separated by millions of leagues they lived by gazing upon each other

if i had a single flower for every time i think about you i could walk forever in my garden

nobody knows you

you dont know yourself

and i who am half in love with you

what am i in love with

my own imaginings

love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own

her desires are mine her wishes are mine should even the world stand against her my blade will be at her side and should it fail to protect her let my own existence be forfeit  ash

please touch me i pray

i mean i hope youre happy

but the sky is still the sky without you

and im not surprised by that anymore

it’s a weird phrase in english in love like it’s a sea you drown in or a town you live in you don’t get to be in anything else—in friendship or in anger or in hope all you can be in is love

how bout a shot of truth in that denial cocktail

you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner elizabeth bennett

im yours for everfor ever and ever here i stand im as firm as a rock if youll only trust me how little youll be disappointed be mine as i am yours

are you asking me to undress tris

a nervous laugh gurgles from my throat only  partially

love is a trap when it appears we see only its light not its shadows

love love until the night collapses

dexter i love you so much so so much and i probably always will i just dont like you anymore im sorry

it’s hard to communicate anything exactly and that’s why perfect relationships between people are difficult to find

your truest friends are the ones who will stand by you in your darkest momentsbecause theyre willing to brave the shadows with youand in your greatest momentsbecause theyre not afraid to let you shine

everyones a little crazy some people just hide it better than others

one word more you look as if you thought it tainted you to be

loved by me you cannot avoid it nay i if i would cannot

cleanse you from it but i would not if i could i have never

loved any woman before my life has been too busy my thoughts

too much absorbed with other things now i love and will love

but do not be afraid of too much expression on my part

so for now

i will miss you like i’ll never see you again

and the next time i see you

i will kiss you like i’ll never kiss you again

and when i fall asleep beside you

i will fall asleep as if i’ll never wake up again

because i don’t know if i will

i don’t know if i will

i will love you like the world is ending

rachel to julia

youve got to have someone who loves your body who doesnt define you but sees you who loves what he sees who you dont have to struggle to be good enough for

i regret tobias tilts his head and sighs i regret my choice

what choice

dauntless he says i was born abnegation i was planning on leaving dauntless and becoming factionless but i met her and i felt like maybe i could make something more of my decision

he looks at her and smiles youre sort of dangerous you know

she stares at him me

yeah he says sitting back im way too honest with you

you know im old in some waysin otherswell im just a little girl i like sunshine and pretty things and cheerfulnessand i dread responsibility

when you leave

without a word i shall gently let you go

how many loved your moments of glad grace

and loved your beauty with love false or true

but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you

and loved the sorrows of your changing face

he is half of my soul as the poets say

she put one hand on mine when someone is in your heart they’re never truly gone they can come back to you even at unlikely times

we are made of all those who have built and broken us

its usually the selfish people who are loved the most they do what you deny yourself and you love them for it you give them your heart

if people are going to be allowed to say we love you and i love you theyd better have the backbone to prove it love isnt just a word

have i told you how hideous you look tonight cardan asks leaning back in the elaborately carved chair the warmth of his words turning the question into something like a compliment

no i say glad to be annoyed back into the present tell me

i cant

when a woman loves you shes not satisfied until she possesses your soul because shes weak she has a rage for domination and nothing less will satisfy her

and we all know love is a glass which makes even a monster appear fascinating

you know what the worst thing i can imagine is simon had said not trusting someone i love

alone with everybody

the flesh covers the bone

and they put a mind

in there and

and the women break

vases against the walls

and them men drink too

and nobody finds the

but they keep

crawling in and out

the bone and the

for more than

theres no chance

at all

we are all trapped

by a singular

the one

the city dumps fill

the junkyards fill

the madhouses fill

the hospitals fill

the graveyards fill

knees suddenly weak she reached for his forearms to stabilize herself you came for me

he beamed looking for all the world like a selfless daring hero

don’t sound so surprised dropping the cane he pulled her into a crushing embrace that tore her away from wolf and lifted her clean off the floor it turns out you are worth a lot of money on the black market

if i never see you again

i will always carry you

on my fingertips

and at brain edges

and in centers

of what i am of

what remains

some people fall in love over and over again while some people can only do it once

like this

if anyone asks you

how the perfect satisfaction

of all our sexual wanting

will look lift your face

and say

like this

when someone mentions the gracefulness

of the nightsky climb up on the roof

and dance and say

like this

if anyone wants to know what spirit is

or what god’s fragrance means

lean your head toward him or her

keep your face there close

like this

when someone quotes the old poetic image

about clouds gradually uncovering the moon

slowly loosen knot by knot the strings

of your robe

like this

if anyone wonders how jesus raised the dead

don’t try to explain the miracle

kiss me on the lips

like this like this

when someone asks what it means

to die for love point

here

if someone asks how tall i am frown

and measure with your fingers the space

between the creases on your forehead

this tall

the soul sometimes leaves the body the returns

when someone doesn’t believe that

walk back into my house

like this

when lovers moan

they’re telling our story

like this

i am a sky where spirits live

stare into this deepening blue

while the breeze says a secret

like this

when someone asks what there is to do

light the candle in his hand

like this

how did joseph’s scent come to jacob

how did jacob’s sight return

a little wind cleans the eyes

like this

when shams comes back from tabriz

he’ll put just his head around the edge

of the door to surprise us

like this

all i want from you is to trust me with what little you can and grow in loving people around you with the same love i share with you its not your job to change them or to convince them you are free to love without an agenda

selftalk reflects your innermost feelings

real museums are places where time is transformed into space

true love is born from understanding

for love is no part of the dreamworld love belongs to desire and desire is always cruel

the question love is whether you want me enough to take the risk

i pray you do not fall in love with me for i am falser than vows made in wine

take my hand and well make it  i swear

its good to let god pick a man for you we dont do so well when we pick them ourselves they end up lipsticks in a drawer all those wrong colors you thought looked so good in the package

no matter how long or how difficult we will undo whatever that moroi boy has done to you

i managed a wavering smile tasting blood in my mouth you sure about that dad because hes done everything to me

my wife and i just dont have the same feelings for each other we used to have i guess i just dont love her anymore and she doesnt love me what can i do

the feeling isnt there anymore i asked

thats right he reaffirmed and we have three children were really concerned about what do you suggest

i told you the feeling just isnt there anymore

you dont understand the feeling of love just isnt there

then love her if the feeling isnt there thats a good reason to love her

but how do you love when you dont love

my friend  love is a verb love  the feeling  is a fruit of love the verb so love her serve her sacrifice listen to her empathize appreciate affirm her are you willing to do that

if you didnt remember something happening was it because it never had happened or because you wished it hadnt

in the absence of love we began slowly but surely to fall apart

i am as wrapped up in her as a vine that clings to a tree seeking for sustenance she’s tied me to her for eternity she’s my home she’s my reason for being to win and hold her heart is my only purpose

i will be with her again or i will die there aren’t any other options

my love is meatloaf flavored i just wish my meatloaf was also meatloaf flavored

she asked if i loved another woman so i answered honestly and said dinner was great but i could go for dessert

maybe you could be mine  or maybe we’ll be entwined  aimless in this sexless foreplay

child its a very bad thing for a woman to face the worst that can happen to her because after shes faced the worst she cant ever really fear anything again scarlett always save something to fear— even as you save something to love

i love you i love you i send this message through my fingers and into his up his arm and into his heart hear me i love you and im sorry to leave you

let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred

he promised us that everything would be okay i was a child but i knew that everything would not be okay that did not make my father a liar it made him my father

no one compares to you but theres no you except in my dreams tonight

if i were rain

that joins sky and earth that otherwise never touch

could i join two hearts as well

im beginning to think that maybe its not just how much you love someone maybe what matters is who you are when youre with them

happiness is part of who we are joy is the feeling

love is one of the true mysteries he said at last the truest and the deepest of all one thing maerad to love is never wrong it may be disastrous it may never be possible it may be the deepest agony but it is never wrong

well you can think what you want so long as you remember  no matter how ordinary things seem between us  im still here still in love with you and care about you more than any other guy evil or otherwise ever will

gamble everything for love if youre a true human being

i take no joy in mead nor meat and song and laughter have become suspicious strangers to me i am a creature of grief and dust and bitter longings there is an empty place within me where my heart was once

time is too slow for those who wait too swift for those who fear too long for those who grieve too short for those who rejoice but for those who love time is eternity

but you cant shut everyone out i mean you have to have someone to love  someone to hold on to   someone

i feel it when i sorrow most

tis better to have loved and lost

than never to have loved at all

everything want to be loved us sing and dance and holler just trying to be loved

isnt hate merely the result of wounded love

infantile love follows the principle i love because i am loved

mature love follows the principle i am loved because i love

immature love says i love you because i need you

mature love says i need you because i love you

it never gets easier missing you and sometimes i wonder if it ever will

my heart is afraid that it will have to suffer

give the ones you love wings to fly roots to come back and reasons to stay

love doesnt always come when you want it to sometimes it just happens despite your will

how can you still count yourself a knight when you have forsaken every vow you ever swore

he loved her

jay heaton her best friend since childhood was in love with her he didnt say it but she knew that it was true

and it was so weird to even be thinking it but she was in love with him too

if i could bronze my love it’d be worthy of a silver medal

and i didnt choose it kat i chose you

we met less than a week ago and in that time ive done nothing but lie and cheat and betray you i know but if you give me a chanceall i want is to protect you to be near you for as long as im able

do not allow me to forget you

i see it now though

and then he touches me again and my convictions disappear like smoke in the wind

tomorrow i will leave tomorrow i will stop delaying the inevitable tomorrow i will quit lying to myself and to him

just one last time sweets just one last fix that’s all i need

and that is why i now understand addiction

he brought out the worst in me and was the best thing that ever happened to me

but i miss screamin and fightin and kissin in the rain and its  am and im cursin your name youre so in love the you act insane and thats the way i loved you

i saw the world from the stars point of view and it looked unbearably lonely

i could’ve sworn i was telling the truth when i told you i didn’t miss you

if you have reasons to love someone you don’t love them

i know i’m not supposed to say this but i love you

love comforteth like sunshine after rain

i was his exception and as much as i had tried to fight my feelings he was mine

love is not all

love is not all it is not meat nor drink

nor slumber nor a roof against the rain

nor yet a floating spar to men that sink

and rise and sink and rise and sink again

love can not fill the thickened lung with breath

nor clean the blood nor set the fractured bone

yet many a man is making friends with death

even as i speak for lack of love alone

it well may be that in a difficult hour

pinned down by pain and moaning for release

or nagged by want past resolution’s power

i might be driven to sell your love for peace

or trade the memory of this night for food

it well may be i do not think i would

i might kiss you

i might be bad at it

thats not possible

everything that happens to you matters to me

you can’t if you can’t feel it if it never

rises from the soul and sways

the heart of every single hearer

with deepest power in simple ways

you’ll sit forever gluing things together

cooking up a stew from other’s scraps

made from your heap of dying ash

let apes and children praise your art

if their admiration’s to your taste

but you’ll never speak from heart to heart

unless it rises up from your heart’s space

sometimes it’s like people are a million times more beautiful to you in your mind it’s like you see them through a special lens — but maybe if it’s how you see themthat’s how they really are it’s like the whole tree falling in the forest thing

i recognized you instantly all of our lives flashed through my mind in a split second i felt a pull so strongly towards you that i almost couldnt stop it

it was rather beautiful the way he put her insecurities to sleep the way he dove into her eyes and starved all the fears and tasted all the dreams she kept coiled beneath her bones

love is like a virus it can happen to anybody at any time

you know what’s a great metaphor for love sleeping beauty because you have to plow through this incredible thicket of thorns in order to get to beauty and even then when you get there you still have to wake her up

im not supposed to miss you im not supposed to care

don’t spoil me with your lies love me with your truth

you put me through hell on purpose made me suffer and there’s no end in sight i don’t know what the fuck you’re doing ace but this dr jekyll and mr hyde shit ain’t cutting it with me

it is that we are never so defenseless against suffering as when we love never so helplessly unhappy as when we have lost our loved object or its love

you can be in love and you can be in a relationship but they’re not always the same thing

when we are in love we are convinced nobody else will do but as time goes others do do and often do do much much better

sometimes loneliness makes the loudest noise

and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood

if anyone were to find out— i began

a real relationship is twoway

two minds with but a single thought two hearts that beat as one

love didnt make you weak it made you stronger

how we need that security how we need another soul to cling to another body to keep us warm to rest and trust to give your soul in confidence i need this i need someone to pour myself into

when you say i and my too much you lose the capacity to understand the we and our

and we certainly wouldnt write about it

i didnt care who kissed you first as long as i kissed you last

i love you every day and now i will miss you every day

you dont need to justify your love you dont need to explain your love you just need to practice your love practice creates the master

regret is mostly caused by not having

that this girl would know exactly how to shatter me

a profound love between two people involves after all the power and chance of doing profound hurt

i know there may be universes out there where i made different choices and they led me somewhere else led me to someone else and my heart breaks for every single version of me that didnt end up with you

i only have so much willpower helen he whispered and since you apparently sleep in the most ridiculously transparent tank top ive ever seen im going to have to ask you to get under the covers before i do something stupid

i once loved a girl who almost loved me but not as much as she loved john cusack

after all a woman who doesnt love cats is never going to be make a man happy

your inner strength is your outer foundation

love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punishd and cured is that the lunacy is so

ordinary that the whippers are in love too

love is a game

for the next x or o

true love isnt expressed in passionately whispered words an intimate kiss or a embrace before two people are married love is expressed in selfcontrol patience even words left unsaid

a man is lucky if he is the first love of a woman a woman is lucky if she is the last love of a man

i like being the girl nobody can have

perhaps watching someone you love suffer can teach you even more than suffering yourself can

it is only with true love and compassion that we can begin to mend what is broken in the world it is these two blessed things that can begin to heal all broken hearts

the reality of loving god is loving him like hes a superhero who actually saved you from stuff rather than a santa claus who merely gave you some stuff

loving someone always requires you to not love others

every life needs a little space it leaves room for good things to enter it

maybe its just hiding somewhere or gone on a trip to come home but falling in love is always a pretty crazy thing it might appear out of the blue and just grab you who knows — maybe even tomorrow

the strength of a love is always misjudged if we evaluate it by its immediate cause and not the stress that went before it the dark and hollow space full of disappointment and loneliness that precedes all the great events in the hearts history

when male authors write love stories the heroine tends to end up dead

i miss you in waves and tonight i’m drowning you left me fending for my life and it feels like you’re the only one who can bring me back to the shore alive

its more like you meet someone and you fall in love and you hope that that person is the one—and then at some point you have to put down your chips you just have to make a commitment and hope that youre right

in love at first sight

but i will always believe

that the people

we love

we have loved before

many many many times before

and when we stumble

through grace and circumstance

and that brilliant illusion of choice

to finally meet them again

we feel it faster

each time through

the one glance

that set life alight

staring through the layers

of lifetimes and stolen glances

and first kisses and hands held

the brace against the weight

and unrelenting tide

in love at first sight

but am not burdened with the misconception

that its a first sight

at all

vladimir did great things—so could she besides they come first right

not always

i stared id had they come first drilled into me since i was a child it was what all guardians believed only the dhampirs whod run away from their duty didnt subscribe to that what he said was almost like treason

sometimes rose you have to know when to put yourself first

he looked at his friend perhaps for the last time and said what he had always known from the moment they’d met when he’d understood that the prince was his brother in soul i love you

it is beautiful to express love and even more beautiful to feel it

can he love her can the soul really be satisfied with such polite affections to love is to burn  to be on fire like juliet or guinevere or eloise

she conquered her demons and wore her scars like wings

the knowledge that she would never be loved in return acted upon her ideas as a tide acts upon cliffs

you might as well make yourself fly as to make yourself love

real love has little to do with falling its a climb up the rocky face of a mountain hard work and most people are too selfish or too scared to bother

very few reach the critical point in their relationship that summons the attention of the light and the dark that place where they will make a commitment to love no matter what obstaclesor temptations appear in their path

i used to think i knew everything i was a smart person who got things done and because of that the higher i climbed the more i could look down and scoff at what seemed silly or simple even religion

theres only one thing that can heal the heart only one its love gaara

i love you i whisper i love you exactly as you are

love is supposed to move mountains to make the world go round to be all you need but it falls apart at the deatils it cant save a single person

love is keeping the promise anyway

embracing tao you become embraced

supple breathing gently you become reborn

clearing your vision you become clear

nurturing your beloved you become impartial

opening your heart you become accepted

accepting the world you embrace tao

bearing and nurturing

creating but not owning

this is love

love entered in my heart one day

but when it begged that it might stay

i let it stay and rest

it broke my nights with sorrowing

it filled my heart with fears

and when my soul was prone to sing

it filled my eyes with tears

butnow that it has gone its way

i miss the dear ole pain

and sometimes in the night i pray

that love might come again

emotion without reason lets people walk all over you reason without emotion is a mask for cruelty

it is very difficult to live among people you love and hold back from offering them advice

just in case you ever foolishly forget im never not thinking of you

you stay safe you love you survive you laugh and cry and struggle and sometimes you fail and sometimes you succeed you push

the true measure of a man is how he treats you when others are not looking

i realized when you look at your mother you are looking at the purest love you will ever know

intrigued by that enigma he dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her

there are all kinds of ways for a relationship to be tested even broken some irrevocably it’s the endings we’re unprepared for

we have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community

ronans second secret was adam parrish

the eskimo has fiftynames for snow because it is important to them there ought to be as many for love

her heart  like every heart if only its fallen sides were cleared away  was an inexhaustible fountain of love she loved everything she saw

for some people the point of no return begins at the very moment their souls become aware of each others’ existence

what sexual preference do you hope she has happiness isnt that cool

without love we all like birds with broken wings

this is the part where i kiss you

everything is clearer when youre in love

i love you even if there isn’t any me or any love or even any life i love you

love only grows by sharing you can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others

poor fellow i think he is in love with you

how sad and bad and mad it was  but then how it was sweet

o here

will i set up my everlasting rest

and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars

from this worldwearied flesh eyes look your last

arms take your last embrace and lips o you

the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss

a dateless bargain to engrossing death

its risky falling in love

what a horrible way to put it he said

if music be the food of love play on

but youve slipped under my skin invaded my blood and seized my heart

only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love

he went through life with his hands firmly shoved into his pockets she danced

youre my star a stargazer too

and i wish that i were heaven

with a billion eyes to look at you

i want him to see the flowers in my eyes and hear the songs in my hands

and you will always be alone

he can touch your soul and there is a difference between having your heart break and having your soul shatter

mom how do you know if the guy is the guy

you mean if he’ll be a good husband she pauses then says the ticket is for the man to love the woman more than she loves him

shouldn’t it be equal

mom cackles it can never be equal

but what if the woman loves the man more

and it seemed so easy once he capitulated it seemed natural and right

kev wasnt certain if he was surrendering to win or to his own passion for her only that there was no more holding back he would take her and he would give her everything he had every part of his soul even the broken pieces

with a chaste heart

with pure eyes i celebrate your beauty

holding the leash of blood

so that it might leap out and trace your outline

where you lie down in my ode

as in a land of forests or in surf

in aromatic loam or in sea music

equally beautiful your feet

arched by primeval tap of wind or sound

your ears small shells

of the splendid american sea

your breasts of level plentitude

fulfilled by living light

your flying eyelids of wheat

revealing or enclosing

the two deep countries of your eyes

the line your shoulders have divided into pale regions

loses itself and blends into the compact halves of an apple

continues separating your beauty down into two columns of

to sink into the two grapes of your feet

where your twin symmetrical tree burns again and rises

over the pact of sea and earth

from what materials

did your body come together

swelling like baking bread to signal silvered hills

the cleavage of one petal

until alone remained

the fine and firm feminine form

it is not only light that falls over the world spreading inside your body

yet suffocate itself

so much is clarity

taking its leave of you

as if you were on fire within

the moon lives in the lining of your skin

i found him carefully studying me his lips in a thin line has anyone ever taken care of you he asked quietly

no i’d long since stopped feeling sorry for myself about it

i told you he whispers back i can feel his breath just tickling the space behind my ear making my hair prick up on my neck i like you

you dont know me i say quickly

i want to though

it’s easy to fall in love ben the hard part comes when you want out

have you ever felt the longing for someone you could admire for something not to look down at but up to

i didnt fall in love of course

its never up to you

but she was walking back and forth

and i was passing through

the love we give away is the only love we keep

i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality this is why right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant

everything about her has to do with me

we’d read about sirens in english this fall greek mythology bullshit about women so beautiful their voices so enchanting that men did anything for them turned out that mythology crap was real because every time i saw her i lost my mind

daddy i whispered feeling my own breath hitch in my throat i love you

just when i was sure he was asleep the one corner of his mouth lifted in a smile i knew that he murmured always knew that

tell me the story

about how the sun loved the moon so much

that she died every night

just to let him breathe

the gospel is this we are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared believe yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in jesus christ than we ever dared hope

but youre so busy changing the world

just one smile can change all of mine

find a woman who makes you feel more alive she wont make life perfect but shell make it infinitely more interesting and then love her with all thats in you

i thought i was going to sweat five years before id feel like this

i wanted it as much as you did ive just got a hell of a poker face i smiled pressing my lips against his

no matter how much you love someone you still want to have you own way

the practice of love offers no place of safety we risk loss hurt pain we risk being acted upon by forces outside our control

i loved him

i couldnt pinpoint what made me so certain but i knew it then as surely as i knew my name or the color of the sky or any fact written in a book

could he feel it too

maxon broke the kiss and looked at me youre so pretty when you are a mess

i laughed nervously thank you for that and for the rain and for not giving up

he ran his fingers along my cheek and nose and chin youre worth it i dont think that you get that youre worth it to me

maybe sometimes we can only see the truth about ourselves if someone shows us where to look

is it possible not to ever know your typenot to even know you have a typeuntil quite suddenly you do

i cant sleep i cant eat i cant do anything but think about him at night i dream of him all day i wait to see him and when i do see him my heart turns over and i think i will faint with desire

hide yourself in god so when a man wants to find you he will have to go there first

why i wake early

hello sun in my face

hello you who made the morning

and spread it over the fields

and into the faces of the tulips

and the nodding morning glories

and into the windows of even the

miserable and the crotchety –

best preacher that ever was

dear star that just happens

to be where you are in the universe

to keep us from everdarkness

to ease us with warm touching

to hold us in the great hands of light –

watch now how i start the day

what was it like to lose him asked sorrow

there was a long pause before i responded

it was like hearing every goodbye ever said to

me—said all at once

to find out if she really loved me i hooked her up to a lie detector and just as i suspected my machine was broken

and even as im kissing him and kissing him and kissing him i wish i were kissing him wanting more more more more like i cant get enough never will be able to get enough

marveling at his own boldness he said softly i would enter your sleep if i could and guard you there and slay the thing that hounds you as i would if it had the courage to face me in fair daylight but i cannot come in unless you dream of me

a quiet but indomitable voice behind me said i believe this is my dance it was him i could feel his presence the warmth of him seeped into my back and i quivered all over like spring leaves in a warm breeze

there will never be a good time financially to get married unless youre shaq or ray romano but somehow people manage if your man is using money as an excuse not to marry you its your relationship thats insecure not his bank account

i love you you’re mine i’ll kill any bastard who tries to take you from me

we should love not fall in love because everything that falls gets broken

the truth washe was in love with her totally overtheline nogoingback notevendeadwouldhepart kind of shit

the best use of life is love the best expression of love is time the best time to love is now

you are what happiness means to me and i would rather have today with you than forever with anyone else

give me the love that leads the way

the faith that nothing can dismay

the hope no disappointments tire

the passion thatll burn like fire

let me not sink to be a clod

…the sad part is that i will probably end up loving you without you for much longer than i loved you when i knew you

some people might find that strange

but the truth of it is that the amount of love you feel for someone and the impact they have on you as a person is in no way relative to the amount of time you have known them

you have to be very fond of men very very fond you have to be very fond of them to love them otherwise theyre simply unbearable

why did he have to be so gorgeous why did he have to stand so close and why did i still love him so much

to love is easy to be in a relationship is extremely difficult

you know what the secret is its so simple we love one another were nice to one another do you know how rare that is  carmen

i really dont even know you and yet in my life you are forever entangled to my history inextricably bound

when you love you should not think you can direct the course of love for love if it finds you worthy directs your course

but that afternoon he asked himself with his infinite capacity for illusion if such pitiless indifference might not be a subterfuge for hiding the torments of love

by night love tie your heart to mine and the two

together in their sleep will defeat the darkness

the heart is a strange beast and not ruled by logic

what barrier is there that love cannot break

you think im cute he said thinkly pulling on her hand

she was glad he couldnt see her face i think youre

beautiful breathtaking like the person in a greek myth who makes one of the gods stop caring about being a god

its not at all hard to understand a person its only hard to listen without bias

i feel…and i have reason to believe…that we could come to mean something to each other

you asked me to go out with you i know you probably changed your mind but you should know the answer was yes its always been yes when it comes to you

i love you for who you are not who the world thinks you should be

i miss you

i miss you i miss you i miss you

be ready because when i see you ill never let you go again

when all is said and done the weather and love are the two elements about which one can never be sure

you were a summer gift one ill always treasure you were a dream i never wanted to wake up from you opened my eyes to things ill never really see youre the best thing that will ever happen to me

you don’t need scores of suitors you need only one… if he’s the right one

get up shahrzad alkhayzuran you kneel before no one least of all me

but what can be done the one who loves must share the fate of the one he loves

say it i gritted out

the high lord of the night court is your mate

i cant promise not to make you mad i cant promise that i wont hurt you all i can promise is that i want you in my life and ill do anything to keep you there

there is love of course and then theres life its enemy

human relationships always help us to carry on because they always presuppose further developments a future  and also because we live as if our only task was precisely to have relationships with other people

she let out a laugh and then she put her hand over her mouth like she was angry at herself for forgetting her sadness

i know i am but summer to your heart

and not the full four seasons of the year

and you must welcome from another part

such noble moods as are not mine my dear

no gracious weight of golden fruits to sell

have i nor any wise and wintry thing

and i have loved you all too long and well

to carry still the high sweet breast of spring

wherefore i say o love as summer goes

i must be gone steal forth with silent drums

that you may hail anew the bird and rose

when i come back to you as summer comes

else will you seek at some not distant time

even your summer in another clime

people will walk in and walk out of your life but the one whose footstep made a long lasting impression is the one you should never allow to walk out

often you dont know whether a woman is friend enemy or lover until it is too late sometimes she is all three

and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains but have not love i am nothing

no magnus strode toward him i didnt call you because im tired of you only wanting me around when you need something im tired of watching you be in love with someone elsesomeone incidentally who will never love you back not the way i do

the desire to love someone always exceeds the desire to be loved by someone  thats exactly why we end up loving the person who doesnt deserve that love

every time i close my eyes its like a dark paradise no one compares to you but theres no you except in my dreams tonight

lately i cant help wanting us

to be like other people

for example if i were a smoker

youd lift a match to the cigarette

just as i put it between my lips

its never been like that

between us none of that

easy chemistry no quick half automatic

flares everything between us

had to be learned

behind my book all my fantasies

of seduction run up

against the rocks

tell me again

why you dont like

sex in the afternoon

no dont tell me

ill never understand you

never understand us americas strangest

loving couple they never

and rarely look at each other

into each others eyes i mean

it has to kill one of us celia says quietly

to make one person the center of your world is bound to end in disaster there are too many factors outside your control

our lips met hungrily and his clever artistic hands wrapped around my hips a sudden buzz from my regular cell phone startled me from the kissing

dont said adrian his eyes ablaze and breathing ragged

what if theres a crisis at school i asked what if angeline accidentally stole one of the campus buses and drove it into the library

why would she do that

are you saying she wouldnt

he sighed go check it

youve got it all wrong

you didnt come here to master unconditional love this is where you came from and where youll return

you came here to learn personal love

infused with divinity

lived through the grace of stumbling

demonstrated through the beauty of messing up

you didnt come here to be perfect you already are

you came here to be gorgeously human flawed and fabulous

and rising again into remembering

but unconditional love stop telling that story

love in truth doesnt need any adjectives

it doesnt require modifiers

it doesnt require the condition of perfection

it only asks you to show up

and do your best

that you stay present and feel fully

that you shine and fly and laugh and cry and hurt and heal and fall and get back up and play and work and live and die as you

its enough

its plenty

day leans in toward me he reaches up to touch my face i can tell it still hurts him to use his fingers and his nails are dark with dried blood youre brilliant he says but youre a fool to stay wish someone like me

i close my eyes at the touch of his hand then were both fools

tucker why would you tell me now if its against the rules

clara because i love you

do you love me westley is that it’

he couldn’t believe it ‘do i love you my god if your love were a grain of sand mine would be a universe of beaches if your love were—‘

‘there has not been—‘

‘if you’re teasing me westley i’m just going to kill you’

‘how can you even dream i might be teasing’

‘well you haven’t once said you loved me’

‘that’s all you need easy i love you okay want it louder i love you spell it out should i i ellohveeee whyohyou want it backward you love i’

‘you are teasing now aren’t you’

i will find you

in the farthest corner i will find you

i touch the tip of my finger to his lips there are secrets in here i say i want them out

he tries to bite my finger

i steal it back

you were born together and together you shall be forevermore

you shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days

ay you shall be together even in the silent memory of god

but let there be spaces in your togetherness

and let the winds of the heavens dance between you

love one another but make not a bond of love

let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls

fill each others cup but drink not from one cup

give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf

sing and dance together and be joyous but let each one of you be alone

even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music

give your hearts but not into each others keeping

for only the hand of life can contain your hearts

and stand together yet not too near together

for the pillars of the temple stand apart

and the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each others shadow

would you just stay with me

stay with you what for look at us were already fighting

so what

so its not gonna be easy its gonna be really hard and were gonna have to work at this everyday but i wanna do that because i want you i want all of you forever you and me everyday

i’ve never been the one not for anybody

he closed the distance between them

you’ll get used to it he tipped her face up to his kissed her

why why am i the one

because my life opened up and it flooded with color when you walked back into it

we need to help people to discover the true meaning of love love is generally confused with dependence those of us who have grown in true love know that we can love only in proportion to our capacity for independence

if loneliness was a choice what was the other option to settle for secondbest and try to be happy with that and was that fair to the person you settled for

i am lost without you i am soulless a drifter without a home a solitary bird in a flight to nowhere i am all these things and i am nothing at all this my darling is my life without you i long for you to show me how to live again

from the stars to the stars

i’ll tell them she said i’ll tell them it was my fault

he looked at her gold eyes incredulous you can’t lie to them

i am beginning to understand said the little prince there is a flower i think that she has tamed me

it was finally becoming clear to her that love wasnt about finding someone perfect to marry love was about seeing through to the truth of a person and accepting all their shades of light and dark love was an ability

and its relentless

just knowing you exist changed the world for me

im telling you this for one reason and one reason only no matter how sure you are of someones love its always nice to hear it

it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love

two separate beings in different circumstances face to face in freedom and seeking justification of their existence through one another will always live an adventure full of risk and promise p

you said move on where do i go

people who meet in airports are seventytwo percent more likely to fall for each other than people who meet anywhere else

you need just the right amount of fuck the world and the right amount of belief in somethingand you need the right amount of love

if you love something let it go

if you dont love something definitely let it go

basically just drop everything who cares

dimitris voice snapped my attention back to him thats adrian ivashkov he said the name the same way everyone else did

this is the second time ive seen you with him

yeah i replied glibly we hang out sometimes

dimitri arched an eyebrow then jerked his head back toward where wed come from you hang out in his room a lot

several retorts popped into my head and then a golden one took precedence what happens between him and me is none of your business i managed a tone very similar to the one hed used on me when making a similar comment about him and tasha

actually as long as youre at the academy what you do is my business

not my personal life you dont have any say in that

are those the only options nothing or forever

but i was young

and didn’t know better

and someone should have told me to capture every second

because now i’m sitting here alone and it’s getting really hard to breath because tears are growing in my throat and they want to break out but there are people

and i just want to be somewhere silent

but still i don’t want to be alone because i’m scared and lonely

and i don’t understand

because i was alone my whole life

my whole life

i was so damn lonely and i was content with that

because i liked myself and my own company

and i didn’t need anyone

but then there was you

so someone should have told me that love is for those few brave who can handle the unbearable emptiness

the unbearable guilt and lack of oneself

because i lost myself to someone i love

and i might get myself back one day

but it will take time it will take time

this is gonna take some time

i wish someone would have told me this

someone should have told me this

its not that i cant live without you its that i dont want to theres a difference we all make choices in life and i choose you

my heart belongs to you and im not asking for it back even if you wont want it anymore im just asking for a chance to have your again i promise ill be more careful with it this time

if a man whistles at you dont turn around you are a lady not a dog

i have loved to the point of madness that which is called madness that which to me is the only sensible way to love

how would your life be different if…you approached all relationships with authenticity and honesty let today be the day…you dedicate yourself to building relationships on the solid foundation of truth and authenticity

don’t fall in love with a woman who reads a woman who feels too much a woman who writes

don’t fall in love with an educated magical delusional crazy woman don’t fall in love with a woman who thinks who knows what she knows and also knows how to fly a woman sure of herself

don’t fall in love with a woman who is interested in politics and is rebellious and feel a huge horror from injustice one who does not like to watch television at all or a woman who is beautiful no matter the features of her face or her body

right now i had everything i could ask for it wasnt a long list but it was a very satisfying one starting with the love of my life back in my arms

right now its hard to imagine that it is raining anywhere in the world

not only did

but i could tell

the universe loved

her too

more than others

she was different

after all i would

be a fool not to

notice the way the

sunshine played with

i think about you every second of every day and i don’t know how to get over you she says

don’t i beg her please don’t get over me

would you like to borrow a pair of my panties to wave around at the next council meeting to get the point across

his eyes flashed got any to spare

i could’ve picked somebody rational but no i had to fall in love with this arrogant idiot come to the keep with me be my princess mourn me when your crazy dad kills me yeah right

a man when he is making up to anybody can be cordial and gallant and full of little attentions and altogether charming but when a man is really in love he cant help looking like a sheep

she soared above the ground and he kept her tethered to the earth without him she would be lost among the clouds

love makes the world go round not at all whiskey makes it go round twice as fast

the ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of the martyr

i love you with a love so great that it simply couldnt keep growing inside my heart but had to leap out and reveal itself in all its magnitude

its okay to love something a little too muchas long as its real to you

youll never be able to let him go youll always feel wrong about being with me

i have no idea what that will mean exactly but im looking forward to finding out with you

what does the brain matter compared with the heart

life is like a game of chess

to win you have to make a move

knowing which move to make comes with insight

and knowledge and by learning the lessons that are

acculated along the way

we become each and every piece within the game called life

gods definition of what matters is pretty straightforward he measures our lives by how we love

under loves heavy burden do i sink

i am almost a hundred years old waiting for the end and thinking about the beginning

there are things i need to tell you but would you listen if i told you how quickly time passes

i know you are unable to imagine this

love is like quicksilver in the hand leave the fingers open and it stays clutch it and it darts away

i would like to be able to breathe— to be able to love her by memory or fidelity but my heart aches i love you continuously intensely

when you decide you want to be with someone forever you want forever to start right now

how lucky am i to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard

because love love is never finished it circles and circles the memories out of order and not always complete

but many of us seek community solely to escape the fear of being alone knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving when we can be alone we can be with others without using them as a means of escape

i am the poet of the poor because i was poor when i loved since i could not give gifts i gave words

this is how the girl who couldnt speak and the man who couldnt see fell in love

i believe the stars align so souls can find one another whether they are meant to be souls in love or souls in life remains to be seen

me quota ang pagibig sa bawat limang umiibig isa lang ang magiging maligaya ang iba iibig sa di sila iniibig iibig nang di natututo o iibig sa wala o di iibig kailanman

people fall in love without reason without even wanting to you cant predict it thats love

the very thought of you

has my legs spread apart

like an easel with a canvas

your greatest awakening comes when you are aware about your infinite nature

the room fell quiet and as i read down the list of over one hundred and fifty eightgrade boys i realized that to me there had only ever been one boy

what i feel for you can’t be conveyed in phrasal combinations it either screams out loud or stays painfully silent but i promise — it beats words it beats worlds

loving you forever cant be wrong even though youre not here cant move on

just for the record she still loves you she wouldnt bother to torture you if she didnt

you can love somebody without it being like that you keep them a stranger a stranger whos a friend

i asked you here tonight because when you realise you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible

i made such a fool of myself she lamented

love does not make you a fool

he didn’t love me back

that does not make you a fool either

just tell me … her voice cracked when does it stop hurting

the quiet world

in an effort to get people to look

into each other’s eyes more

and also to appease the mutes

the government has decided

to allot each person exactly one hundred

and sixtyseven words per day

when the phone rings i put it to my ear

without saying hello in the restaurant

i am adjusting well to the new way

late at night i call my long distance lover

proudly say i only used fiftynine today

i saved the rest for you

when she doesn’t respond

i know she’s used up all her words

so i slowly whisper i love you

thirtytwo and a third times

after that we just sit on the line

and listen to each other breathe

the most introspective of souls are often those that have been hurt the most

my lifemy whole life take it and do with it what you will i love youlove you as i have never loved any living thing from the moment i met you i loved you loved you blindly adoringlymadly

you didnt know it thenyou know it now

the purpose of relationship is not to have another who might complete you but to have another with whom you might share your completeness

love doesnt give you very many choices when you love someone you just want to be with them if they break your heart you will still love them because hearts are easy to break and though love is tender and sometimes fragile love isnt

love addicts you to its feeling you never ever want to lose that feeling sometimes the fear of losing love drives people to do crazy things like buy a plane ticket make a phone call run out of a class cry write laugh

because when you love someone you really love them you give them your whole heart you trust them you never want to be away from them sometimes you dont even need their words you just need them there

love is such an amazing thing and too many people take it for granted if youre in love dont let it go dont you dare let it go

buy a gift for a dog and youll be amazed at the way it will dance and swerve its tail but if dont have anything to offer to it it wont even recognize your arrival such are the attributes of fake friends

he said that we belonged together because he was born with a flower and i was born with a butterfly and that flowers and butterflies need each other for survival

that must be love when everything else in the world could implode and you wouldnt care as long as you had that one person standing beside you

there was nowhere i could go that wouldnt be you

her existence alone was excuse enough to justify the creation of the entire world

ill always want him until every sun goes dark in every sky until i am nothing more than longforgotten cosmic dust i will want him and even then i suspect my particles will long for his

there is no perfection only beautiful versions of brokenness

my mother used to tell me that when push comes to shove you always know who to turn to that being a family isnt a social construct but an instinct

time expands then contracts all in tune with the stirrings of the heart

and lovers cannot see

the pretty follies

that themselves commit

i hold the bottle out into the rain and watch as the steady flow slowly fills it when there is enough enough that beth can clearly see i close the bottle and hand it to her

she raises a skeptical eyebrow but accepts the bottle

its our rain beth

her head barely shakes to show her confusion while i rub the back of my neck and search for my courage i told you i loved you in this rain and when you doubt my words i want you to look at this bottle

i wish the dayd begin

i wish it would rain or snow

or the wind would blow

or the grass would grow

i wish i had yesterday

i wish there were games to play

love is like a good cake you never know when its coming but youd better eat it when it does

she wanted to lose herself in him to tie his arms around her like a tourniquet

if she showed him how much she needed him hed run away

i understood that as much as i had resisted the outside as much as i had constricted my life as much as i had closed and narrowed the channels into me there were still many takers for the quiet heart

i wanted to see the place where margaret grew to what she is even at the worst time of all when i had no hope of ever calling her mine

i dont want to live i want to love first and live incidentally

love is like the sea its a moving thing but still and all it takes its shape from the shore it meets and its different with every shore

mysteries of attraction could not always be explained through logic sometimes the fractures in two separate souls became the very hinges that held them together

when i like people immensely i never tell their names to anyone it is like surrendering a part of them i have grown to love secrecy

your memory feels like home to me

so whenever my mind wanders it always finds it’s way back to you

perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved that is we demand something love from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demandfree and asking for nothing but his company

sometimes i think gravity may be death in disguise other times i think gravity is love which is why loves only demand is that we fall

you want to take me to a movie i asked

well not really he said what i really want is for you to be my girlfriend but i thought saying that might scare you off

i loved him as we always love for the first time with idolatry and wild passion

what am i supposed to call you

your royal husbandness its required by law im afraid

the spiritualization of sensuality is called love it is a great triumph over christianity

ill come and make love to you at five oclock if im late start without me

it’s too bad if a heart lacks fire

and is deprived of the light

the day on which you are

is the most wasted day of your life

images flashed through his mind he saw nico and his sister on a snowy cliff in maine percy jackson protecting them from a manticore percys sword gleamed in the dark hed been the first demigod nico had ever seen in action

will she whispered say something will

but there was nothing to say there was only emptiness as there had been before her as there would always be

i have lost everything will thought everything

i’m not scared

of the monsters

my bed

i’m much more scared

of the boys

with messy brown hair

that only know

how to form

sometimes remembering hurts too much

his breathing was ragged beg to differ mercer

you carried my heart in your hands tonight he said but i have felt as if you carried it long before that

some things are better left in the past and true things are destined to repeat themselves

i’ve been working hard to become the kind of man she needs the kind of man she already believes me to be

i gave you my heart but it wasnt enough

all any of us wanted really was to know that we counted that someone elses life would not have been as rich without us here

thank youfor gracing my life with your lovely presence for adding the sweet measure of your soul to my existence

the world is not a pleasant place to be without someone to hold and be held by

i realized i’m in love its always been right in front of me

the thing is that world doesnt exist all growing up means is that your realize no one will come along to fix things no one will come along to save you

god our knees touching isnt enough i need more

shes knotting her fingers together on her lap as if she doesnt know what to do with them i want to touch her but what if she pulls away like before ive never been such a wuss with a girl in my life

i bite my bottom lip as i slide my hand about millionth of a millimeter closer to her hand

she doesnt seem fazed so i move closer and closer

when the tips of my fingers touch her wrist she freezes but she doesnt jerk her hand away god her skin is so soft i think as my fingers trail a path from her wrist to her knuckles to her smooth manicured nails

with a slight shift of my hand i lace my fingers through hers

im holding hands with maggie armstrong

the bus stops suddenly and i look out the window its our stop she must have realized this because she pulls her hand away from mine and stands i follow behind still reeling

i don’t understand the hatred and fear of gays and bisexuals and lesbians…

it’s a concept i honestly cannot grasp to me it’s not who you love…

a man a woman what have you…

it’s the fact that you love that is all that truly matters

i canti cant think about anything or anyone else he whispered a hand drifted up dragging back through his hair i cant think straight when youre around i cant sleep it feels like i cant breathei just

liam please i begged youre tired youre barely over being sick lets just can we just go back to the others

i love you he turned toward me that agonized expression still on his face i love you every second of everyday and i dont understand why or how to make it stop

he looked wild with pain it pinned me in place even before what he had said registered in my mind

i know its wrong i know it down to my damn bones and i feel like im sick im trying to be a good person but i cant i cant do this anymore

love is not something you protect it’s something you risk

what we all want really is to be loved that craving drives our worst behavior

the bottom line is that we never fall for the person were supposed to

if in thirst you drink water from a cup you see god in it those who are not in love with god will see only their own faces in it

without dreams i have to be content with my own imagination– which is almost as good i can picture all of those things perfectly as well as how itll be when i take your life from this world

friends ask you questions enemies question you

love was the most savage monster of all

you left with my soul in your fists and my heart in your teeth and i don’t want either of them back ben

its a very brave thing to fall in love you have to be willing to trust somebody else with your whole being and thats very difficult really difficult and very brave

youre a dream like everything else

you know i love you right the urge to kiss her goodbye was so strong that i almost broke our rules

she smiled beautiful and golden in the late morning light not as much as i love you

oh man this is my dream come true having an ‘i love you more’ debate here i’ll start i love you more your turn

sydney laughed and opened the door i’ve taken debate classes you’d lose to my logic

you seem to think you have a choice cam said but you have it backwards love chooses you the shadow moves as the sun commands

but i leave myself in your hands what choice do i have by the time you read this last page that if anywhere is the only place i will be

does that count as an argument can we kiss and make up now

it was only half an argument

fine then you kiss and i’ll make up

i laughed until he effectively shut me up with his lips

i think  i should go home soon mom and luke are probably going nuts what about you

he shrugged a casual lift of one shoulder you tell me when i left nevernever i didnt have any plans other than being with you if you want me around just say the word

it always struck me in years after how bizarre it was how two people could look at one another with such tenderness and complete love and how quickly that could dissolve into nothing but bitterness

live simply deepest joy is like a flowerbeautiful in essence

okay then i’ll just say i love you there is nothing in this world more important to me than you are i’m only content when you’re near my whole purpose is to be what you need me to be it’s not poetry but it’s from my heart will that do

lies can sound awfully pretty when a girl is in love with the person telling them

its easy to cry when you realize that everyone you love will reject you or die

i reserve the right to love many different people at once and to change my prince often

i cut myself because you wouldnt let me cry

i cried because you wouldnt let me speak

i spoke because you wouldnt let me shine

i shone because i thought you loved me

a man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a womans love however badly he may have treated her

adults are the death of hope

voicemail  hi isabel culpeper i am lying in my bed looking at the ceiling i am mostly naked i am thinking of … your mother call me

voicemail  the first minute and thirty seconds of i’ve gotta get a message to you by the bee gees

voicemail  hotel california by the eagles in its entirety with every instance of the word california replaced with minnesota

voicemail  i wish you’d answer

it hurts to love its like giving yourself to be flayed and knowing that at any moment the other person may just walk off with your skin

love and you shall be loved

you may only call me mrs darcy when you are completely and perfectly and incandescently happy

some people feel love in their hearts julie some of us feel it all way into our souls were the ones who cant forget

i look at you and i think about you and  i dont know no one has ever confounded me the way you do

the opposite of love is not hate it is indifference

in love there are two things  bodies and words

they do make love stories for girls with black hearts after all they go like this

choice or no my heart is his

she blushed and so did he she greeted him in a faltering voice and he spoke to her without knowing what he was saying

two seconds later the sound of an alarm filled my ears

what did you do i said over the noise as he backed up towards the bathroom door

the girl who gave you the note

i caught her staring at my lighter

i blinked you gave a child in a psych ward  a lighter

his eyes crinkled at the corners she seemed trustworthy

youre sick i said but smiled

hey nobodys perfect  noah smiled back

i want him to love me as much as i love him

there’s always that one guy who gets a hold on you not like your best friend’s brother who gets you in a headlock kind of hold or the little kid you’re babysitting who attaches himself to your leg kind of hold

gilbert im afraid im scandalously in love with you

oh dont mind me came an extremely sarcastic voice near the wall you two go ahead and make out–ill just sit here and bleed quietly

love doesn’t have to be on valentine’s day it doesn’t have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirtythree or fiftynine it doesn’t have to conform to whatever is usual it doesn’t have to be kismet at once or rhapsody by the third day

it just has to be in time in place in spirt

it just has to be

love is proved the moment you let go of someone because they need you to

he wanted to take his love back from her so badly the old techniques didn’t work anymore in fact they’d never worked how do you stop loving someone it was one of the world’s more brutal mysteries the more you tried the less it worked

she knew whose love she doubted it wasnt her parents and it wasnt her friends it was her own

not like this he wanted it to be real

if you listen to the wind very carefully youll be able to hear me whisper my love for you

those mornings when we kiss and surrender for an hour before we say a single word

please he says im begging you to stop

i cant stomach your pain he says i can feel it so strongly and its making me crazy please he says to me dont be sad or hurt or guilty youve done nothing wrong

im sorry

dont be sorry either he says god the only reason im not going to kill kent for this is because i know it would only upset you more

i could still smell her on my fur it clung to me a memory of another world

i was drunk with it with the scent of her id got too close

the smell of summer on her skin the halfrecalled cadence of her voice the sensation of her fingers on my fur every bit of me sang with the memory of her closeness

too close

i couldnt stay away

better to put your heart on the line risk everything and walk away with nothing than play it safe love is a lot of things but safe isn’t one of them

he shook his head just looking at me

what i asked

nothing he said

why are you looking at me like that

i kind of scoffed or sighed or exhaled in a way that was vaguely coughy and then said im not beau

you are like a millennial natalie portman like v for vendetta natalie portman

never seen it

really he asked pixiehaired gorgeous girl dislikes authority and cant help but fall for a boy she knows is trouble its your autobiography so far as i can tell

his every syllable flirted honestly he kind of turned me on i didnt even know that guys could turn me on  not like in real life

love that moves the sun and the other stars

i just dont see why the past has to matter

but these things don’t matter at all because once you are real you can’t be ugly except to people who don’t understand

so many believe that it is love that grows but it is the knowing that grows and love simply expands to contain it

take it from me love has all the lasting permanence of a rainbow beautiful while its there and just as likely to have disappeared by the time you blink

i want my world to start and end with you

falling into ruin was a bit like falling in love both descents stripped you bare and left you as you were at your core and both endings are equally painful

love is blind they saybut isnt it more that love makes us see too much isnt it more that love floods our brain with sights and sounds so that everything looks bigger brighter more lovely than ever before

kitten your hands are heaven and your eyes are my home

he is both the source of my happiness and the one i want to share it with

she was eighteen she was the most beautiful woman in a hundred years she didn’t seem to care

‘you’re all right’ her mother asked

buttercup sipped her cocoa ‘fine’ she said

‘you’re sure’ her father wondered

‘yes’ buttercup replied there was a very long pause ‘but i must never love again’

she never did

he didnt mind how he looked to other people because the nursery magic had made him real and when you are real shabbiness doesnt matter

elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could you begin said she

this goes to show you that sometimes the unseen is not to be feared and that those meant to love us most are not always ones who do

i could feel the warmth of his presence as if a soft blanket had been wrapped around my soul around my heart it held me and protected me it sheltered me and i knew i wasn’t alone anymore

sometimes i shrink from your knowing what i have felt for you and sometimes i am distressed that all of it you will never know

if you cannot hold me in your arms then hold my memory in high regard

and if i cannot be in your life then at least let me live in your heart

if you have two parents who love you you have won lifes lotto

if you do not have parents or if the parents you have are so broken and so frankly terrible that they are no improvement over nothing this is fine

its not ideal because its harder without adults who love you more than they love themselves but harder is just harder thats all

to me you are a work of art and i would give you my heart  thats if i had one

and he

it is better to have an enemy who will fight you in an open field then a lover who will kill you in your sleep

you have a beautiful laugh like the promise of tomorrow

sometimes you have to learn to love whats good for you

faith goes up the stairs that love has built and looks out the windows which hope has opened

i wanted movement and not a calm course of existence i wanted excitement and danger and the chance to sacrifice myself for my love

a gentleman holds my hand

a man pulls my hair

a soulmate will do both

i will love you even when i am dust on the wind

it isnt about love vee said its about fun

thank you creator of the universe for the gift of life you have given me

thank you for giving me everything that i have ever needed

thank you for the opportunity to experience this beautiful body and this wonderful mind

thank you for living inside me with all your love and your pure and boundless spirit

with your warm and radiating light

thank you for using my words for using my eyes for using my heart to share your love wherever i go

i love you just the way you are and because i am your creation i love myself just the way i am

help me to keep the love and the peace in my heart and to make that love a new way of life that i may live in love the rest of my life

dont be afraid to lose him because if a man truly loves you hes not going anywhere

you dont have to say i love you to say i love you you said with a shrug all you have to do is say my name and i know

cant you hear it you said when you love someone you say their name different like its safe inside your mouth

what are you wishing for grace interrupted to kiss you i said to her

he is the cheese to my macaroni

dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman that his love has an earlier death

think of it we could have gone on longing for one another and pretending not to notice forever this obsession with dignity can ruin your life if you let it

i’m sort of… coming off a bad relationship

when did it end

slightly before it started

love is born into every human being it calls back the halves of our original nature together it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature

you have within youright noweverything you need to deal with whatever the world can throw at you

she writes things with her movements that i for the life of me could never write with a pen

i want you i want you so badly i can’t stand it when you left it felt like the world got darker like i couldn’t truly see anything couldn’t feel anything

love will come

and when love comes

love will hold you

love will call your name

and you will melt

love will hurt you but

love will never mean to

love will play no games

has been hard enough already

falling in love is like owning a dog

throw things away and love will bring them back

again and again and again

but most of all love needs love lots of it

and in return love loves you and never stops

you and i

we had no ending

no said goodbye

for all my life

ill wonder why

she had never imagined she had the power to make someone else so happy and not a magical power eithera purely human one

it is love not reason that is stronger than death

i’m not a warrior or a goddess i said at last

adrian leaned closer as far as i’m concerned you’re both

i remember when your name was just another name that rolled without thought off my tongue

now i can’t look at your name without an abundance of sentiment attached to each letter

your name which i played with so carelessly so easily has somehow become sacred to my lips

a name i won’t throw around lightheartedly or repeat without deep thought

and if ever i speak of you i use the english language to describe who you were to me you are nameless because those letters grouped together in that familiar form… carries too much meaning for my capricious heart

the only difference between falling in love and being in love is that your heart already knows how you feel but your mind is too stubborn to admit it

to love someone enough to let them go you had to let them go forever or you did not love them that much

and you drink a little too much and try a little too hard and you go home to a cold bed and think that was fine and your life is a long line of fine

love it was the beginning and end of everything the foundation and the ceiling and the air in between

the magic that occurs

when you give a person

to just be themselves

you can give without loving but you can never love without giving

love is happiness but only when you believe it will last forever even though every time it turns out to be a lie it’s only faith that gives love its strength and its joy

simon so were you following me or is it just an amazing coincidence that you happened to be on the roof of a building i was walking by when i got attacked

jace i was following you

simon is this the part where you tell me youre secretly in love with me

you are at once both the quiet and the confusion of my heart imagine my heartbeat when you are in this state

when what you want is a relationship and not a person get a dog

love can rebuild the world they say so everythings possible when it comes to love

there was a man who loved the moon but whenever he tried to embrace her she broke into a thousand pieces and left him drenched with empty arms

soulmate is an overused term but a true soul connection is very rare and very real

it made me think of isabel back at her house we didnt have what sam and grace had we werent even close to having it i didnt think what we had could get to this even if you gave it a thousand years

i wanted to tell her that i loved her and not in the complicated way i loved our parents but in a simple way i never had to think about i loved her like breathing

ah me but where are now the songs i sang

when life was sweet because you call’d them sweet

love is not an emotion it is your very existence

i dont understand how i can know so little about love and how it works how i can be so bad at it when its all ive ever wanted

all ive ever known is about leaving or being left

i give her the only honest and true answer i have

youre where i want to be

life is like a sandwich

birth as one slice

and death as the other

what you put inbetween

the slices is up to you

is your sandwich tasty or sour

then you look at her and smile a smile your dissembling face will remember until the day you die baby you say baby this is part of my novel

this is how you lose her

i think sometimes when we find love we pretend it away or ignore it or tell ourselves we’re imagining it because it is the most painful kind of hope there is

dustfinger still clearly remembered the feeling of being in love for the first time how vulnerable his heart had suddenly been such a trembling quivering thing happy and miserably unhappy at once

soul connections are not often found and are worth every bit of fight left in you to keep

and besides    i don’t want to leave you er you guys

he smiled and it lit up his whole face well ‘we’ are certainly happy to hear that oh and i’m also happy to watch our darling little love child dragon while you’re in st louis

if he cant handle you at your worst then he does not deserve you at your best real love means seeing beyond the words spoken out of pain and instead seeing a persons soul

true love always makes a man better no matter what woman inspires it

i think it’s beautiful

the way you sparkle

when you talk about

the things you love

and think not you can direct the course of love for love if it finds you worthy directs your course

—i dont want to lose you

—then why are you the one that keeps letting go

he didnt realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark

he looked at her as a man might look at a faded flower he had plucked in which it was difficult for him to trace the beauty that had made him pick and so destroy it

that’s a silly question the one with the dirty face of course’

no the one with the dirty face will look at the other man and assume that he looks like him and vice versa the man with the clean face will see his colleague covered in grime and say to himself i must be dirty too i’d better have a wash’

what are you trying to say’

do you think we can be friends i asked

he stared up at the ceiling probably not but we can pretend

the heart makes its choices without weighing the consequences it doesnt look ahead to the lonely nights that follow

i met a boy whose eyes showed me that the past present and future were all the same thing

the cord pulled taut and she rebounded flying back up before falling again as her velocity slowed she opened her eyes and found herself dangling at the end of the cord about five feet above jace he was grinning

nice he said as graceful as a falling snowflake

was i screaming she asked genuinely curious you know on the way down

he nodded thankfully no ones home or they would have assumed i was murdering you

ha you cant even reach me she kicked out a leg and spun lazily in midair

jaces eyes glinted want to bet

clary knew that expression no she said quickly whatever youre going to do

now he said that was much better you didnt scream at all

i didnt get the chance she was breathless and not just from the impact of the fall being sprawled on top of jace feeling his body against hers made her hands shake and her heart beat faster

unwinged and naked sorrow surrenders its crown to a throne called grace

i know what my heart is like

since your love died

it is like a hollow ledge

left there by the tide

drying inward from the edge

darkness may hide the trees

and the flowers from the eyes

but it cannot hide

love from the soul

kisses open doors ive noticed that one gesture can unlock secrets ease open feelings it cant be preventedthese kisses just are its how they work they break into basements you never knew you had

what’s wrong is that every morning and every night i lie in bed wondering why you’re not beside me

i’ll be there wherever you want‘there’ to be

curran to kate

in love the other is important in lust you are important

i know love is fragile and loving someone like you is near impossible like holding something shattered through a raging sandstorm if you want her to love you shelter her from that storm…and make certain that storm isn’t you

falling in love was like falling off a cliff it felt pretty much like flying until you hit the ground

we all know interspecies romance is weird

i shouldnt have to be a liar to make someone love me i shouldnt be so afraid of losing someone that ill do anything to make them stay

love is a force unto itself sayyidi for love people consider the unthinkableand often achieve the impossible i would not sneer at its power

and i got out of there without punching anyone kicking anyone or breaking down in tears some days the small victories are all you achieve

he didnt marry you to become king he became king because he wanted to marry you

then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him beforeand it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky she was the only real thing in the world

you promised seaweed brain we would not get separated ever again

you’re impossible

love you too

no human should mislead another by promising them something they know to be untrue

the supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves—say rather loved in spite of ourselves

set the standard stop expecting others to show you love acceptance commitment  respect when you dont even show that to yourself

three years thats a thousand tomorrows maam

i must try to see the difference between my picture of a person and his behavior as it is narcissistically distorted and the persons reality as it exists regardless of my interests needs and fears

i love him wholly and unconditionally and without reservation i love him enough to sacrifice a friendship i love him enough to accept my own happiness and use it in turn to make him happy back

i don’t want to be your first fallon i want to be your last

i am the least difficult of men all i want is boundless love

i dont look for love love looks for me why because it needs me because im not afraid of it

too many adults wish to protect teenagers when they should be stimulating them to read of life as it is lived

the worst thing he told me

is bitterness people end up so

it was a beautiful night

thats completely asinine

the truth is that adults love in different ways not the only way

only you only you are love

there is a love i reminisce

ive never sown

or lips that im yet to kiss

and eyes

not met my own

hands that wrap around my wrists

and arms

that feel like home

i wonder how it is i miss

these things

ive never known

perhaps people like us cannot love ordinary people can  that is their secret

everything happens for a reason and something better will come along for me

love is bullshit emotion is bullshit i am a rock a jerk im an uncaring asshole and proud of it

mine was the twilight and the morning mine was a world of rooftops and love songs

i know what i have given you

i do not know what you have received

we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love

the only sea i saw was the seesaw sea with you riding on it lie down lie easy let me shipwreck in your thighs

i have loved in life and i have been loved

i have drunk the bowl of poison from the hands of love as nectar

and have been raised above lifes joy and sorrow

my heart aflame in love set afire every heart that came in touch with it

my heart has been rent and joined again

my heart has been broken and again made whole

my heart has been wounded and healed again

a thousand deaths my heart has died and thanks be to love it lives yet

i went through hell and saw there loves raging fire

and i entered heaven illumined with the light of love

i wept in love and made all weep with me

i mourned in love and pierced the hearts of men

and when my fiery glance fell on the rocks the rocks burst forth as volcanoes

the whole world sank in the flood caused by my one tear

with my deep sigh the earth trembled and when i cried aloud the name of my beloved

i shook the throne of god in heaven

i bowed my head low in humility and on my knees i begged of love

disclose to me i pray thee o love thy secret

she took me gently by my arms and lifted me above the earth and spoke softly in my ear

my dear one thou thyself art love art lover

and thyself art the beloved whom thou hast adored

sometimes i think my whole life has been about holding on to you

don’t marry him don’t be with him be with me

i want your most vital organ i want it to be mine

i guess the sacrifice of my dignity is the only thing that will save us now the things i endure for love the fates laugh at my torment

love moderately long love doth so

too swift arrives as tardy as too slow

love each other in moderation that is the key to longlasting love too fast is as bad as too slow

what made me run away was doubtless not so much the fear of settling down but of settling down permanently in something ugly

i am larger better than i thought i did not know i held so much goodness

all seems beautiful to me

whoever denies me it shall not trouble me

whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me

i dont care said seth i would have done it i would have sold my soul for you you and mei told you somethings always going to keep us near each othereven if we arent together

you see there are some people that one loves and others that perhaps one would rather be with

no one has imagined us we want to live like trees

sycamores blazing through the sulfuric air

dappled with scars still exuberantly budding

our animal passion rooted in the city

the surest way to hurt yourself is to give up on love just because it didn’t

work out the first time

in the shadow my father has cast over my entire life you are the only light i can see anymore and whatever the cost i refuse to let that light be extinguished

so shut up live travel adventure bless and dont be sorry

katniss i’m coming back into focus when caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home

peeta gives an unconvincing shake of head

caesar handsome lad like you there must be some special girl come on what’s her name

peeta well there is this one girl i’ve had a crush on her ever since i can remember but i’m pretty sure she didn’t know i was alive until the reaping

caesar she have another fellow

peeta i don’t know but a lot of boys like her

caesar so here’s what you do you win you go home she can’t turn you down eh

peeta i don’t think it’s going to work out winning… won’t help in my case

caesar why ever not

peeta because… because… she came here with me

caesar oh that is a piece of bad luck

peeta it’s not good

caesar well i don’t think any of us can blame you it’d be hard not to fall for that young lady she didn’t know

peeta not until now

the trick  is to find the balance between the bright colors of humor and the serious issues of identity selfloathing and the possibility for intimacy and love when it seems no longer possible or sadder yet no longer necessary

life is fragile and temporary the faces of today quickly become the faces of the past sorrow pain and anger it all fades

except love love is forever and there after even when weve fallen to our graves

give me the waters of lethe that numb the heart if they exist i will still not have the power to forget you

id sell my soul to have you in my whole life youll always be what i wanted most

never stop smiling not even when youre sad someone might fall in love with your smile

he who is in love is wise and is becoming wiser sees newly every time he looks at the object beloved drawing from it with his eyes and his mind those virtues which it possesses

she had a wild wandering soul

but when she loved she loved with chaos and that made all the difference

sweet talker i scoffed you didn’t know anything about me the first time we met

i knew you were beautiful he said i just hoped for the rest

you are my whole heart scarlet and this is breaking it

my heart cracked open and clear dropped out of me my mouth opened and i looked round me and stamped my foot does this look like a good time to tell me that you damn stupid boy i meant to sound mean but my voice wobbled now

he gave a little smile my foulmouthed warrior

how far have you walked for men who’ve never held your feet in their laps

kids chase the love that eludes them

do you ever just put your arms out and just spin and spin and spin well thats what love is like everything inside of you tells you to stop before you fall but for some reason you just keep going

it is easy to hate and it is difficult to love this is how the whole scheme of things works all good things are difficult to achieve and bad things are very easy to get

we love men because they can never fake orgasms even if they wanted to

because they write poems songs and books in our honor

because they never understand us but they never give up

because they can see beauty in women when women have long ceased to see any beauty in themselves

because they come from little boys

because they can churn out long intricate machiavellian or incredibly complex mathematics and physics equations but they can be comparably clueless when it comes to women

because they are incredible lovers and never rest until we’re happy

because they elevate sports to religion

because they’re never afraid of the dark

because they don’t care how they look or if they age

because they persevere in making and repairing things beyond their abilities with the naïve selfassurance of the teenage boy who knew everything

because they never wear or dream of wearing high heels

because they’re always ready for sex

because they’re like pomegranates lots of inedible parts but the juicy seeds are incredibly tasty and succulent and usually exceed your expectations

because they’re afraid to go bald

because you always know what they think and they always mean what they say

because they love machines tools and implements with the same ferocity women love jewelry

because they go to great lengths to hide unsuccessfully that they are frail and human

because they either speak too much or not at all to that end

because they always finish the food on their plate

because they are brave in front of insects and mice

because a wellspoken fouryear old girl can reduce them to silence and a beautiful year old can reduce them to slobbering idiots

because they want to be either omnivorous or ascetic warriors or lovers artists or generals but nothing inbetween

because for them there’s no such thing as too much adrenaline

because when all is said and done they can’t live without us no matter how hard they try

because they’re truly as simple as they claim to be

because they love extremes and when they go to extremes we’re there to catch them

because they are tender they when they cry and how seldom they do it

because what they lack in talk they tend to make up for in action

because they make excellent companions when driving through rough neighborhoods or walking past dark alleys

because they really love their moms and they remind us of our dads

because they never care what their horoscope their motherinlaw nor the neighbors say

because they don’t lie about their age their weight or their clothing size

because they have an uncanny ability to look deeply into our eyes and connect with our heart even when we don’t want them to

because when we say i love you they ask for an explanation

most people are slow to champion love because they fear the transformation it brings into their lives and make no mistake about it love does take over and transform the schemes and operations of our egos in a very mighty way

why me she asked holding on to him

if its ka itll come like a wind and your plans will stand before it no more than a barn before a cyclone

what made you fall in love with a prostitute

i didn’t understand it myself at the time but i’ve thought about it since and i think it was because knowing that your body would never be mine alone i had to concentrate on conquering your soul

marriage must fight constantly against a monster which devours everything routine

nico studied his face – his seagreen eyes his grin his ruffled black hair somehow percy jackson seemed like a regular guy now not a mythical figure not someone to idolize or crush on

you are my more

my love my life

love brings to light a lovers noble and hidden qualitieshis rare and exceptional traits it is thus liable to be deceptive of his normal qualities

he gripped her hard forcing her to meet his eyes as he snarled i see you i see every part of you and i am not afraid

i will not be afraid

a line in the burning brightness

my name is aelin ashryver galathynius

and i will not be afraid

fall in love with someone

who tastes like adventure

but looks like

the calm beautiful morning

after a terrible storm

i dont believe it quince says with absolute certainty  i dont believe anything magical can make someone more in love  he looks me right in the eye as he says love is already the strongest magic in the world

look i said we knew jason and becky would be back the break would end this isnt a surprise its whats supposed to happen its what we wanted right

is it he asked is it what you want

he loved her he loved her and until hed loved her she had never minded being alone

there is only one happiness in life to love and be loved

it’s all about falling in love with yourself and sharing that love with someone who appreciates you rather than looking for love to compensate for a self love deficit

now that he brought it up i did recall saying that great betrayed by my own immorality

god bonessome of that was depraved

ill take that as a compliment he closed the distance between usi love you dont be ashamed of anything we did even if your prudery is on life support

your love should never be offered to the mouth of a stranger  only to someone who has the valor and daring to cut pieces of their soul off with a knife  then weave them into a blanket to protect you

if you love something let it go if it comes back its yours

rosie hmmm good point what are the s for

ruby fixing what you fucked up in your s

rosie great looking forward to it

human existence is so fragile a thing and exposed to such dangers that i cannot love without trembling

if there is such a thing as a good marriage it is because it resembles friendship rather than love

i believe that lovenot imitationis the sincerest form of flattery your imitator thinks that you can be duplicated your lover knows you cant

borges said there are only four stories to tell a love story between two people a love story between three people the struggle for power and the voyage all of us writers rewrite these same stories ad infinitum

no you sick stupid creep i love you i shouldnt i shouldnt youre sick inside caine sick but i love you

whenever you are ready or if you never are my heart is yours until death do us part whatever that may mean when consorting with one of death’s handmaidens

i prayed for all his dreams to come true i prayed that i would always be able to connect with himeven if i was no longer on earth

real love finds you once if youre lucky

in the vastness of space and the immensity of time it is my joy to share a planet and an epoch with annie

dedication to sagans wife ann druyan in cosmos

just because you love someone doesnt mean you have to be involved with them love is not a bandage to cover wounds

love is an engraved invitation to grief

im afraid theyre in love he said concerned they dont want to leave you he lifted one hand from her waist to gently brush a pair from her neck where their wings fanned against her jaw melancholy he said i know just how they feel

i have come to the conclusion never again to think of marrying and for this reason i can never be satisfied with anyone who would be blockhead enough to have me

grief is like the ocean it comes on waves ebbing and flowing sometimes the water is calm and sometimes it is overwhelming all we can do is learn to swim

one of the most important things you can do on this earth is to let people know they are not alone

maybe you expected marriage to be perfect  i guess thats where you and i are different see i thought it would be all about making mistakes but doing it with someone whos there to remind you what you learned along the way

here are the things i want for you

i want you to be happy i want someone else to know the warmth of your smile to feel the way i did when i was in your presence

i want you to remember my lips beneath your fingers and how you told me things you never told another soul i want you to know that i have kept sacred everything you had entrusted in me and i always will

finally i want you to know how sorry i am for pushing you away when i had only meant to bring you closer and if i ever felt like home to you it was because you were safe with me  i want you to know that most of all

sometimes you know in your heart you love someone but you have to go away before your head can figure it out

you dont need another human being to make your life complete but lets be honest having your wounds kissed by someone who doesnt see them as disasters in your soul but cracks to put their love into is the most calming thing in this world

you know i love you right

i know he breathed his arm tightening automatically around my waist you know how much i wish it was enough

lift your hips for me love

i love you i thought but i didn’t say it it was not that i feared she would laugh in my face she was far too kind for that my fear was a greater one— that she won’t say it back

tomas did not realize at the time that metaphors are dangerous metaphors are not to be trifled with a single metaphor can give birth to love

doubt thou the stars are fire

doubt that the sun doth move

doubt truth to be a liar

but never doubt i love

time is how you spend your love

when love beckons to you follow him

though his ways are hard and steep

and when his wings enfold you yield to him

though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you

and when he speaks to you believe in him

though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden

but if in your fear you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure

then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of

love’s threshingfloor

into the seasonless world where you shall laugh but not all of your laughter

and weep but not all of your tears

but if you love and must needs have desires let these be your desires

to melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night

to know the pain of too much tenderness

to be wounded by your own understanding of love

and to bleed willingly and joyfully

she gave a little gasp if you love me all so much why are you still dressed she whispered you know nothing jon snow nothoh oh ohhh

afterward she was almost shy or as shy as ygritte ever got the thing you did she said when they lay together on their piled clothes with yourmouth she hesistated is thatis it what lordss do to their ladies down in the south

i dont think so no one had ever told jon just what lords did with their ladies i onlywanted to kiss you there thats all you seemed to like it

aye ii liked it some no one taught you such

theres been no one he confessed only you

having an eye for beauty isnt the same thing as a weaknessexcept possibly when it comes to you

i never wanted to have anything in my life that i couldnt stand losing but its too late for that

i can hate you more but ill never love you less

you know he said under normal circumstances you inviting me to the bedroom would be the highlight of my day

i crossed my arms and sat on the bed i did so out of simple fatigue but a moment later i was struck by what i was doing this is where adrian sleeps im touching the covers hes wrapped in every night what does he wear does he wear anything

i jumped up

i never understood how men could remember all those details about sports but yet were incapable of remembering where they set their car keys or wallet

fear can’t be reasoned with neither can hate they’re like love they’re almost identical emotions that’s why ares and aphrodite like each other their twin sons – fear and panic – were spawned from both war and love

my lover asks me

what is the difference between me and the sky

the difference my love

is that when you laugh

i forget about the sky

love too has to be learned

falling in love should be the easiest thing in the world but its not

its delicious to have people adore you but its exhausting too particularly when your own feelings dont match theirs

i wished it was raining he said

i dont need the rain i said i need you

you are enough to drive a saint to madness or a king to his knees

you think im pretty

without any makeup on

you think im funny

when i tell the puch line wrong

i know you get me

so ill let my walls come down down

yes st claire i like you but i cant say it aloud because hes my friend and friends dont let other friends make drunken declarations and expect them to act upon them the next day

the most difficult aspect of moving on is accepting that the other person already did

what you are to do without me i cannot imagine

the strategic adversary is fascism the fascism in us all in our heads and in our everyday behavior the fascism that causes us to love power to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us

i loved you long before you loved me its the only thing i have you beat at and ill bring it up every chance i get

i sighed softly she was absolutely right

im with you no matter what else you have in your head im with you and i love you

when you really love someone you see all their mess and their brokenness and you love them anyway in fact seeing all of that sort of makes you love them more

i miss everything about you

cant believe that i still want you

and after all the things weve been through

in god there is no hunger that needs to be filled only plenteousness that desires to give

hes just a boy said luke aleches not perfect and youre not fallen

were all fallen said magnus and he wrapped himself up in his chains and was silent

love is on every side and no ones side dont ask what love can do for you

you know the memories he whispered turning toward the crib

the newchild stirred slightly in his sleep jonas looked over at him

there could be love jonas whispered

the opposite of loneliness is not togetherness  its intimacy

to me you were more than just a person you were a place where i finally felt at home

i want you to want me because you want me not because of grief not because he is not here i want you to love me for me i want you to kiss me first and not because you need me to help you but because you need to kiss me

you and i its as though we have been taught to kiss in heaven and sent down to earth together to see if we know what we were taught

peter will love lara jean with all his heart always

love is making friends with fear because fear is the constant companion of intimacy  and when you bring fear out of the darkness and into the light you realize it was an illusion based on our own insecurities

love has no limitations it cannot be measured it has no boundaries although many have tried love is indefinable

we are at our most powerful the moment we no longer need to be powerful

i don’t love you as if you were the saltrose topaz

or arrow of carnations that propagate fire

i love you as certain dark things are loved

secretly between the shadow and the soul

i would kiss you in the middle of the ocean during a lightning storm cuz id rather be left for﻿ dead than wondering what thunder sounds like

some people are born with tornadoes in their lives but constellations in their eyes other people are born with stars at their feet but their souls are lost at sea

becausebecauseshe came here with me

love is never supposed to hurt love is supposed to heal to be your haven from misery to make living fucking worthwhile

we can live without religion and meditation but we cannot survive without human affection

sometimes that mountain youve been climbing is just a grain of sand and what youve been up there searching for forever is in your hands when you figure out love is all that matters after all it sure makes everything else seem so small

were not words henry were people

words are how others define us but we can define ourselves any way we choose

i was feeling insecure you might not love me anymore

you’re sorry i damn near drank myself to death i could barely get out of bed i shattered my phone into a million pieces on new year’s eve to keep from calling you … and you’re sorry

i bit my lip and nodded ashamed i had no idea what he’d been through and hearing his say the words made sharp pain twist inside my chest i’m so … so sorry

you’re forgiven he said with a grin don’t ever do it again

i won’t i promise

he flashed his dimple and shook his head i fucking love you

love is what moves the world ive always thoughtit is the only thing which allows men and women to stand in a world where gravity always seems to want to pull them downbring them lowand make them crawl

she thought she was independent and strong but she got one small taste of love and she was hungrier than anyone she was ravenous

it took me years to figure out that upset was upset and tumultuousness was not the same thing as passion love isnt drama

love is a fruit in season at all times and within reach of every hand

he will love only once  but it will be for always

quit being so hard on yourself we are what we are we love what we love we dont need to justify it to anyone not even to ourselves

you must learn to forgive a man when hes in love hes always a nuisance

magnus had come to a horrible realization one that he knew would cause him nothing but pain and suffering from that day forward

but there was no changing the truth of it

he had fallen in love with her

the difference between the love of a man and the love of a woman is that a man will always give reasons for loving but a woman gives no reasons for loving

ive decided that im not going to try to squeeze myself into a friendship that hurts me anymore im going to let her go and just be friends with people who make me feel good about myself

if you’re searching for a quote that puts your feelings into words – you won’t find it

you can learn every language and read every word ever written – but you’ll never find what’s in your heart

how can you

he has it

like youre riding a train at night across some vast plain and you

catch a glimpse of a tiny light in a window of a farmhouse in an

instant its sucked back into the darkness behind and vanishes but

if you close your eyes that point of light stays with you just

barely for a few moments

and what do you know of love

that it must be a choice

oh my naive thief  i pause briefly to meet his gaze love is rarely a choice

every time you almost die i almost die myself

what business had i to think of one that never thought of me

the most basic and somehow forgettable thing is this love is not pain love is goodness and real loveits less shiny than solid and simple

and all i could think was that i would like to spend every morning for the rest of my life waking up beside her

love sought is good but givn unsought is better

its become impossible to deny he means something to me

traveling in the company of those we love is home in motion

in this story

i am the poet

youre the poetry

do you remember what you said to me once that you could help me only by loving me wellyou did love me for a moment and it helped me it has always helped me

his heart had been right there was only one

i begin to long for some little language such as lovers use broken words inarticulate words like the shuffling of feet on pavement

i know your soul everything else is just an ornament

let this hell be our heaven

love one another but make not a bond of love

let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls

fill each others cup but drink not from one cup

give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf

sing and dance together and be joyous but let each one of you be alone

even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music

far too many people opened their hearts and lives at the drop of a hat why give someone that power over you why endow them with the ability to hurt you that much let someone in and you were asking for an emotional kicking some day

the process of falling in love at first sight is as final as it is swift in such a case but the growth of true friendship may be a lifelong affair

kev to win

books are to me as homemade tattoos are to an inmate cant get enough of them

…if a man can be properly said to love something it must be clear that he feels affection for it as a whole and does not love part of it to the exclusion of the rest

if she’s not careful i might just fall in love with her tonight

you must learn to know the difference between tales and the truth my liza she would say fairy tales have a habit of ending too soon they never show what happens afterwards when the prince and princess ride off the page

do you know what i see in you now the usual aura a steady golden yellow healthy and strong with spikes of purple here and there but when i do this

he rested a hand on my hip and my whole body tensed up that hand moved around my hip slipping under my shirt to rest on the small of my back my skin burned where he touched me and the places that were untouched longed for that heat

i hope you find someone who knows how to love you when you are sad

for awhile i thought that was love

im ruined beyond repair is what i fearand if so in time wed both be wretched and bitter

i know people can be mended not all and some more immediately than others but some can be i dont see why not you

why not me

youd be surprised what people will do for money that they wouldnt do for

above all i have been a sentient being a thinking animal on this beautiful planet and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure

my love is something valuable to me which i ought not to throw away without reflection

love is it just a word that boys use to manipulate girls

that is the rule of the wilds you must be bigger and stronger and tougher you must hurt or be hurt

say you’ll marry me when i come back or before god i won’t go i’ll stay around here and play a guitar under your window every night and sing at the top of my voice and compromise you so you’ll have to marry me to save your reputation

i love how you talk to lytlings you dont talk down to them you respect them and anybody can tell youre actually interested in what they have to say

i love your skin like copper dusted over with gold and your eyes – theyre the color of a forest lake shaded by evergreens one of the secret places that only the demonai know about

i love the scent of you – when youve been out in the fresh air and that perfume you put behind your ears sometimes

believe it or not i even love your road smell – of sweat and horses and leather and wool

i want to breathe you in for the rest of my life

this is the true measure of love when we believe that we alone can love that no one could ever have loved so before us and that no one will ever love in the same way after us

i knowand i love you but i dont think we love each other in the same way andi think keeping you near me would destroy me

and the two of them loved each other for a long time in silence without making love again

wow said adrian he sat down on the bed and tested its bounciness giving it a nod of approval this is amazing what do you think buttercup

i have no words i said honestly

he patted the spot beside him want to try it out

infatuation is not quite the same thing as love its more like loves shady second cousin whos always borrowing money and cant hold down a job

whoever loves much performs much and can accomplish much and what is done in love is done well

love is the only future god offers

i love you beyond paint beyond melodies beyond words and i hope you will always feel that even when im not around to tell you so

suddenly it was too hard to be in his presence too painful to know that he would belong to someone else

the true miracle lies in our eagerness to allow appreciate and honor the uniqueness and freedom of each sentient being to sing the song of their heart

tucker strokes my hair theres something so tender about the gesture it might as well have been him whispering i love you

youre not lost kaylee you cant ever be lost because ill always know where you are and if im not there with you im on my way and nothing standing between us will be standing for very long

she is delightfully chaotic a beautiful mess loving her is a splendid adventure

they don’t want me they’re curious why you want me and anyway i feel sorry for anyone that thinks they have a chance i am hopelessly and completely in love with you

we were very different and we disagreed about a lot of things but he was always so interesting you know

the artist always has the masters in his eyes

what will survive of us is love

from a writer

it’s just so strange

you used to love me

and now you’re a stranger

who happens to know all

of my secrets

no im not mistaken i know you dont love me but im going to fight for your love there are some things in life that are worth fighting for to the end you are worth it

to love someone why do you need societys approval and permission

he didnt look like the same person who picked me up this morning noahsarcastic distant untouchable noahcared and that made him real

why is it that words like these seem dull and cold is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name

was it all in my head a lunar trick

her stomach twisted no she shook her head fervently how to explain that she hadn’t had the gift before that she couldn’t have used it against him i would never lie—

the words faded she had lied everything he knew about her had been a lie

i’m so sorry she finished the words falling lamely in the open air

kai peeled his eyes away finding some place of resignation off in the glistening garden you’re even more painful to look at than she is

nothing of real worth can ever be bought love friendship honour valour respect all these things have to be earned

we join spokes together in a wheel

but it is the center hole

that makes the wagon move

we shape clay into a pot

but it is the emptiness inside

that holds whatever we want

we hammer wood for a house

but it is the inner space

that makes it livable

we work with being

but nonbeing is what we use

it’s a blessed thing to love and feel loved in return

true friends will always push you towards the great possibilities of your future false friends will always chain you to the mistakes in your past

she puts her hands on either side of my face and the room falls away i have never gotten so lost in a kiss before

and then the space between us explodes my heart keeps missing beats and my hands cannot bring her close enough to me i taste her and realize i have been starving

i have loved before but it didnt feel like this

i have kissed before but it didnt burn me alive

maybe it lasts a minute and maybe its an hour all i know is that kiss and how soft her skin is when it brushes against mine and that even if i did not know it until now i have been waiting for this person forever

love demands expression it will not stay still stay silent be good be modest be seen and not heard no it will break out in tongues of praise the high note that smashes the glass and spills the liquid

ten long trips around the sun since i last saw that smile but only joy and thankfulness that on a tiny world in the vastness for a couple of moments in the immensity of time we were one

to long a sacrifice can make a stone of a heart

your heart’s strength is measured by how hard it holds on your self worth and faith is measured by finally letting go however your peace is measured by how long you don’t look back

why dont you want anyone to know

tasha ozera is an amazing woman shes beautiful and shes brave but she doesnt

she doesnt get you i finished

he nodded i knew that but i still wanted the relationship i knew it would be easy and that she could take me away from you i thought she could make me forget you

id thought the same thing about mason but she couldnt

yes and sothats a problem

she was afraid of heights

but she was

much more afraid

you dont fall in love with someone because its convenient

in the slaughterhouse of love they kill only the best none of the weak or deformed dont run away from this dying whoevers not killed for love is dead meat

i felt his other hand sear hot against my cheek he bent his head and in a voice that jack couldn’t hear said when you came down the stairs and fell into me that was the moment then his lips pressed against mine

wine enters through the mouth

love the eyes

i raise the glass to my mouth

i look at you

what i was trying to say he whispered is that i see you in everything there isn’t a word for you that means enough because you’re everything to me

did you know we were leaving for idris catarina told me shed been summoned to make a portal i guessed magnus said wryly i was a little surprised you hadnt called or texted to tell me you were going away

you never answer my calls or texts said alec

that hasnt stopped you before

everyone gives up eventually alec said besides jace broke my phone

what alec asked honestly puzzled

youre justyoure soi really want to kiss you magnus said abruptly and then shook his head see this is why i havent been willing to see you

vane grabbed me dulac let’s chat

chat britishspeak for stand still while i yell at you

hmm…now that i think about it housecats are often coddled and petted you don’t pet me nearly enough you must be a lax owner how selfish of you to deprive your cat of attention

him that i love i wish to be free  even from me

i know the truth now youve figured out im falling in love with you and youre trying to make me stop by hurting me this way well it wont work

one way or another im going to make you care about me yes i am unless your cold attitude kills me first

its only fair connor if im going to be miserable by god so are you

i am not a common wench and i will not be treated like one

ive got you i swear to god ive got you said noah stay with me echo

i wanted to i wanted to stay with him but the shouting and screams and glass breaking in my mind grew louder make it stop

he tightened his grip on my arms fight echo youve got to fucking fight come on baby youre safe

the first question which the priest and the levite asked was if i stop to help this man what will happen to me butthe good samaritan reversed the question if i do not stop to help this man what will happen to him

i love you more than songs can say but i cant keep running after yesterday

i love jere more than anybody he’s my brother my family i hate myself for doing this but when i see you two together i hate him too his voice broke

don’t marry him don’t be with him be with me

it’s impossible he snapped

why

because i’m sebastian lord st vincent i can’t be celibate everyone knows that

a person learns how to love himself through the simple acts of loving and being loved by someone else

no woman can love a weak man hard enough to make him strong

the suns gone dim and the moons gone black for i loved him and he didnt love back

a heart once stolen can never be taken back

a girl can wait for the right man to come along but in the meantime that doesnt mean she cant have a wonderful time with all the wrong ones

now as we stand three feet apart and stare at each other i feel the full distance that comes with spending so much time apart a moment filled with the electricity of a first meeting and the uncertainty of strangers

marriage is not a process for prolonging the life of love sir it merely mummifies its corpse

happiness is the china shop love is the bull

for men i think love is a thing formed of equal parts lust and astonishment the astonishment part women understand the lust part they only think they understand

if i love you is that a fact or a weapon

its funny no matter how hard you try you cant close your heart forever and the minute you open it up you never know whats going to come in but when it does you just have to go for it because if you dont theres not point in being here

we often mistake love for fireworks  for drama and dysfunction but real love is very quiet very still its boring if seen from the perspective of high drama love is deep and calm  and constant

always said the count i am always in love

for beatrice when we first met

i was lonely and you were pretty

now i am pretty lonely

heartbreak is a loss divorce is a piece of paper

animals are reliable many full of love true in their affections predictable in their actions grateful and loyal difficult standards for people to live up to

clary jace said open your eyes

im done i dont need anything more out of life i have you and thats enough

i know im not going to be in your head all the time but once you know me ill be forever in your heart

you cant make anyone love you you just have to reveal who you are and take your chances

love people who hate you pray for people who have wronged you it won’t just change their life…it’ll change yours

im selfish impatient and a little insecure i make mistakes i am out of control and at times hard to handle but if you cant handle me at my worst then you sure as hell dont deserve me at my best

youve gotta dance like theres nobody watching

love like youll never be hurt

sing like theres nobody listening

and live like its heaven on earth

you know youre in love when you cant fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams

a friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you

darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that

we accept the love we think we deserve

it is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not

as he read i fell in love the way you fall asleep slowly and then all at once

the opposite of love is not hate its indifference the opposite of art is not ugliness its indifference the opposite of faith is not heresy its indifference and the opposite of life is not death its indifference

it is not a lack of love but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages

love all trust a few do wrong to none

have you ever been in love horrible isnt it it makes you so vulnerable it opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up

being deeply loved by someone gives you strength while loving someone deeply gives you courage

there is never a time or place for true love it happens accidentally in a heartbeat in a single flashing throbbing moment

love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own

you love me real or not real

i tell him real

im in love with you he said quietly

love looks not with the eyes but with the mind

and therefore is winged cupid painted blind

love is like the wind you cant see it but you can feel it

you dont love someone because theyre perfect you love them in spite of the fact that theyre not

if you can make a woman laugh you can make her do anything

we’re all a little weird and life is a little weird and when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness—and call it love—true love

there is nothing i would not do for those who are really my friends i have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature

love never dies a natural death it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of witherings of tarnishings

if i had a flower for every time i thought of youi could walk through my garden forever

the real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or smiling into your eyes or just staring into space

dumbledore watched her fly away and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to snape and his eyes were full of tears

after all this time

when someone loves you the way they talk about you is different you feel safe and comfortable

to die will be an awfully big adventure

a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment

so its not gonna be easy its going to be really hard were gonna have to work at this everyday but i want to do that because i want you i want all of you forever everyday you and me everyday

just when you think it cant get any worse it can and just when you think it cant get any better it can

tis better to have loved and lost

than never to have loved at all

i love you as certain dark things are to be loved

in secret between the shadow and the soul

the one you love and the one who loves you are never ever the same person

some people dont understand the promises theyre making when they make them i said

right of course but you keep the promise anyway thats what love is love is keeping the promise anyway

when we love we always strive to become better than we are when we strive to become better than we are everything around us becomes better too

one is loved because one is loved no reason is needed for loving

when i despair i remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won there have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they can seem invincible but in the end they always fall think of italways

love is needing someone love is putting up with someones bad qualities because they somehow complete you

we love the things we love for what they are

i would die for you but i wont live for you

in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you

perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act just once with beauty and courage perhaps everything that frightens us is in its deepest essence something helpless that wants our love

so i love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you

i carry your heart with me i carry it in my hearti am never without it anywhere

i go you gomy dear and whatever is done by only me is your doingmy darling

i fear no fate for you are my fatemy sweeti want no world for beautiful you are my worldmy true

and its you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you

here is the deepest secret nobody knows

here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life which grows

higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide

and this is the wonder thats keeping the stars apart

i carry your heart i carry it in my heart

you are and always have been my dream

the only thing worse than a boy who hates you a boy that loves you

you are my best friend as well as my lover and i do not know which side of you i enjoy the most i treasure each side just as i have treasured our life together

never love anyone who treats you like youre ordinary

promise yourself

to be so strong that nothing

can disturb your peace of mind

to talk health happiness and prosperity

to every person you meet

to make all your friends feel

that there is something in them

to look at the sunny side of everything

and make your optimism come true

to think only the best to work only for the best

and to expect only the best

to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others

as you are about your own

to forget the mistakes of the past

and press on to the greater achievements of the future

to wear a cheerful countenance at all times

and give every living creature you meet a smile

to give so much time to the improvement of yourself

that you have no time to criticize others

to be too large for worry too noble for anger too strong for fear

and too happy to permit the presence of trouble

to think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world

not in loud words but great deeds

to live in faith that the whole world is on your side

so long as you are true to the best that is in you

i would always rather be happy than dignified

where there is love there is life

nobody has ever measured not even poets how much the heart can hold

some women choose to follow men and some women choose to follow their dreams if youre wondering which way to go remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesnt love you anymore

once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering

the best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds and thats what youve given me thats what id hoped to give you forever

hes more myself than i am whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same

every heart sings a song incomplete until another heart whispers back those who wish to sing always find a song at the touch of a lover everyone becomes a poet

doubt thou the stars are fire

doubt that the sun doth move

doubt truth to be a liar

but never doubt i love

we loved with a love that was more than love

this is a good sign having a broken heart it means we have tried for something

eleanor was right she never looked nice she looked like art and art wasnt supposed to look nice it was supposed to make you feel something

and so the lion fell in love with the lamb… he murmured i looked away hiding my eyes as i thrilled to the word

what a stupid lamb i sighed

what a sick masochistic lion

out beyond ideas of wrongdoing

and rightdoing there is a field

ill meet you there

when the soul lies down in that grass

the world is too full to talk about

a guy and a girl can be just friends but at one point or another they will fall for each othermaybe temporarily maybe at the wrong time maybe too late or maybe forever

the more i know of the world the more i am convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love i require so much

i have decided to stick to lovehate is too great a burden to bear

whats meant to be will always find a way

they say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world someone to love something to do and something to hope for

hearts are made to be broken

two people in love alone isolated from the world thats beautiful

this above all to thine own self be true

and it must follow as the night the day

thou canst not then be false to any man

for the two of us home isnt a place it is a person and we are finally home

the world is indeed full of peril and in it there are many dark places but still there is much that is fair and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief it grows perhaps the greater

they didn’t agree on much in fact they didn’t agree on anything they fought all the time and challenged each other ever day but despite their differences they had one important thing in common they were crazy about each other

you could have had anything else in the world and you asked for me

she smiled up at him filthy as he was covered in blood and dirt he was the most beautiful thing shed ever seen

but i dont want anything else in the world

love is so short forgetting is so long

the very essence of romance is uncertainty

there is always some madness in love but there is also always some reason in madness

if all else perished and he remained i should still continue to be and if all else remained and he were annihilated the universe would turn to a mighty stranger

to douchebags he said gesturing to brad and to girls that break your heart he bowed his head to me his eyes lost focus and to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her

if you remember me then i dont care if everyone else forgets

man may have discovered fire but women discovered how to play with it

what i want is to be needed what i need is to be indispensable to somebody who i need is somebody that will eat up all my free time my ego my attention somebody addicted to me a mutual addiction

my daddy said that the first time you fall in love it changes you forever and no matter how hard you try that feeling just never goes away

what i need is the dandelion in the spring the bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction the promise that life can go on no matter how bad our losses that it can be good again

and in the end

the love you take

is equal to the love you make

love doesnt just sit there like a stone it has to be made like bread remade all the time made new

love does not consist of gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction

i dont trust people who dont love themselves and tell me i love you  there is an african saying which is be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt

i am not sure exactly what heaven will be like but i know that when we die and it comes time for god to judge us he will not ask how many good things have you done in your life rather he will ask how much love did you put into what you did

it was love at first sight at last sight at ever and ever sight

love is a fire but whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house you can never tell

my dear

find what you love and let it kill you

let it drain you of your all let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness

let it kill you and let it devour your remains

for all things will kill you both slowly and fastly but it’s much better to be killed by a lover

falsely yours

i will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way

and now these three remain faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love

if you love somebody let them go for if they return they were always yours if they dont they never were

i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun

i have something i need to tell you he says i run my fingers along the tendons in his hands and look back at him i might be in love with you he smiles a little im waiting until im sure to tell you though

thats sensible of you i say smiling too we should find some paper so you can make a list or a chart or something

i feel his laughter against my side his nose sliding along my jaw his lips pressing my ear

maybe im already sure he says and i just dont want to frighten you

i laugh a little then you should know better

fine he says then i love you

you are the answer to every prayer ive offered you are a song a dream a whisper and i dont know how i could have lived without you for as long as i have

i can feel peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks so now that youve got me what are you going to do with me i turn into him put you somewhere you cant get hurt

if pain must come may it come quickly because i have a life to live and i need to live it in the best way possible if he has to make a choice may he make it now then i will either wait for him or forget him

be careful of love itll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong

how many slams in an old screen door depends how loud you shut it how many slices in a bread depends how thin you cut it how much good inside a day depends how good you live em how much love inside a friend depends how much you give em

love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does love is a battle love is a war love is a growing up

if you like her if she makes you happy and if you feel like you know herthen dont let her go

when love is not madness it is not love

it is good to love many things for therein lies the true strength and whosoever loves much performs much and can accomplish much and what is done in love is well done

i love you more than there are stars in the sky and fish in the sea

declarations of love amuse me especially when unrequited

true love is rare and its the only thing that gives life real meaning

do you think im pretty

i think youre beautiful

you are so beautiful it hurts sometimes

whats this he demanded looking from clary to his companions as if they might know what she was doing there

its a girl jace saidrecovering his composure surely youve seen girls before alec your sister isabelle is one

a womans heart should be so hidden in god that a man has to seek him just to find her

i love you remember they cannot take it

i think if it is true that

there are as many minds as there

are heads then there are as many

kinds of love as there are hearts

love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired

i was smiling yesterdayi am smiling today and i will smile tomorrowsimply because life is too short to cry for anything

i loved her against reason against promise against peace against hope against happiness against all discouragement that could be

the most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much and forgetting that you are special too

if i can stop one heart from breaking i shall not live in vain

it is a curious thought but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them

when the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace

of all forms of caution caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness

is this the moment harry asked weakly and when nothing happened except that ron and hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot he raised his voice oi theres a war going on here

ron and hermione broke apart their arms still around each other

i know mate said ron who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a bludger so its now or never isnt it

never mind that what about the horcrux harry shouted dyou think you could just  just hold it in until weve got the diadem

yeah  right  sorry  said ron and he and hermione set about gathering up fangs both pink in the face

more smiling less worrying more compassion less judgment more blessed less stressed more love less hate

all i ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart

what is love i have met in the streets a very poor young man who was in love his hat was old his coat worn the water passed through his shoes and the stars through his soul

well now

if little by little you stop loving me

i shall stop loving you

little by little

if suddenly you forget me

do not look for me

for i shall already have forgotten you

if you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my life

and you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where i have roots

that on that day at that hour i shall lift my arms

and my roots will set off to seek another land

what is hell i maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love

the greater the love the greater the tragedy when its over

find what you love and let it kill you

if you gave someone your heart and they died did they take it with them did you spend the rest of forever with a hole inside you that couldnt be filled

if shes amazing she wont be easy if shes easy she wont be amazing if shes worth it you wont give up if you give up youre not worthy  truth is everybody is going to hurt you you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for

its not the face but the expressions on it its not the voice but what you say its not how you look in that body but the thing you do with it you are beautiful

never close your lips to those whom you have already opened your heart

it isnt possible to love and part you will wish that it was you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal

the man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends

things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end if not always in the way we expect

any fool can be happy it takes a man with real heart to make beauty out of the stuff that makes us weep

you know when it works love is pretty amazing its not overrated theres a reason for all those songs

love is not affectionate feeling but a steady wish for the loved persons ultimate good as far as it can be obtained

they say when you are missing someone that they are probably feeling the same but i dont think its possible for you to miss me as much as im missing you right now

gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love

to me fearless is not the absense of fear its not being completely unafraid to me fearless is having fears fearless is having doubts lots of them to me fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death

we waste time looking for the perfect lover instead of creating the perfect love

to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees

be the reason someone smiles be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness in people

i love you like a fat kid loves cake

one cannot think well love well sleep well if one has not dined well

have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time

and when her lips met mine i knew that i could live to be a hundred and visit every country in the world but nothing would ever compare to that single moment when i first kissed the girl of my dreams and knew that my love would last forever

it is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important

i would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only i would like to be that unnoticed and that necessary

welcome to the wonderful world of jealousy he thought for the price of admission you get a splitting headache a nearly irresistable urge to commit murder and an inferiority complex yippee

he does something to me that boy every time it’s his only detriment he steps on my heart he makes me cry

you couldnt relive your life skipping the awful parts without losing what made it worthwhile you had to accept it as a wholelike the world or the person you loved

as if you were on fire from within

the moon lives in the lining of your skin

love is an untamed force when we try to control it it destroys us when we try to imprison it it enslaves us when we try to understand it it leaves us feeling lost and confused

life he realize was much like a song in the beginning there is mystery in the end there is confirmation but its in the middle where all the emotion resides to make the whole thing worthwhile

look after my heart  ive left it with you

tonight i can write the saddest lines

i loved her and sometimes she loved me too

you cant measure the mutual affection of two human beings by the number of words they exchange

how do you spell love  piglet

you dont spell ityou feel it  pooh

happiness is only real when shared

i crave your mouth your voice your hair

silent and starving i prowl through the streets

bread does not nourish me dawn disrupts me all day

i hunt for the liquid measure of your steps

i hunger for your sleek laugh

your hands the color of a savage harvest

hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails

i want to eat your skin like a whole almond

i want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body

the sovereign nose of your arrogant face

i want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes

and i pace around hungry sniffing the twilight

hunting for you for your hot heart

like a puma in the barrens of quitratue

and then he gives me a smile that just seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me

maybeyoull fall in love with me all over again

hell i said i love you enough now what do you want to do ruin me

yes i want to ruin you

good i said thats what i want too

i wasnt actually in love but i felt a sort of tender curiosity

letting go doesnt mean that you dont care about someone anymore its just realizing that the only person you really have control over is yourself

someone i loved once gave me a box full of darkness it took me years to understand that this too was a gift

was it hard i ask

not as hard as holding on to something that wasnt real

sometimes its a form of love just to talk to somebody that you have nothing in common with and still be fascinated by their presence

a definition not found

in the dictionary

not leaving an act of trust and love

often deciphered by children

when i am with you we stay up all night

when youre not here i cant go to sleep

praise god for those two insomnias

and the difference between them

one day you will kiss a man you cant breathe without and find that breath is of little consequence

tears shed for another person are not a sign of weakness they are a sign of a pure heart

art and love are the same thing it’s the process of seeing yourself in things that are not you

anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves so anyone whos in love gets sad when they think of their lover its like stepping back inside a room you have fond memories of one you havent seen in a long time

i loved you like a man loves a woman he never touches only writes to keeps little photographs of

promise me youll never forget me because if i thought you would id never leave

then i realize what it is its him something about him makes me feel like i am about to fall or turn to liquid or burst into flames

every one of us is in the cosmic perspective precious if a human disagrees with you let him live in a hundred billion galaxies you will not find another

im saying that im a moody insecure narrowminded jealous borderline homicidal bitch and i want you to promise me that youre okay with that because its who i am and youre what i need

you yourself as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection

sometimes when i look at you i feel im gazing at a distant star

its dazzling but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago

maybe the star doesnt even exist any more yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything

im not sentimentalim as romantic as you are the idea you know

is that the sentimental person thinks things will lastthe romantic

person has a desperate confidence that they wont

a purpose of human life no matter who is controlling it is to love whoever is around to be loved

be with me always  take any form  drive me mad only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you oh god it is unutterable i can not live without my life i can not live without my soul

the saddest people ive ever met in life are the ones who dont care deeply about anything at all passion and satisfaction go hand in hand and without them any happiness is only temporary because theres nothing to make it last

a halfread book is a halffinished love affair

if conversation was the lyrics laughter was the music making time spent together a melody that could be replayed over and over without getting stale

to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance

you could have fooled me everytime i called you luke said you were sick i figured you were avoiding me again

i wasnt i did want to talk to you ive been thinking about you all the time

ive been thinking about you too

i really was sick i swear i almost died back there on the ship you know

i know everytime you almost die i almost die myself

happiness is holding someone in your arms and knowing you hold the whole world

im on aslans side even if there isnt any aslan to lead it im going to live as like a narnian as i can even if there isnt any narnia

im oxygen and hes dying to breathe

there is only one page left to write on i will fill it with words of only one syllable i love i have loved i will love

respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be

who being loved is poor

love can change a person the way a parent can change a baby awkwardly and often with a great deal of mess

people have forgotten this truth the fox said but you mustn’t forget it you become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed you’re responsible for your rose

do not fall in love with people like me

i will take you to museums and parks and monuments and kiss you in every beautiful place so that you can never go back to them without tasting me like blood in your mouth

i will destroy you in the most beautiful way possible and when i leave you will finally understand why storms are named after people

i like flaws i think they make things interesting

it is easy to love people in memory the hard thing is to love them when they are there in front of you

friendship marks a life even more deeply than love love risks degenerating into obsession friendship is never anything but sharing

peeta how come i never know when youre having a nightmare i say

i dont know i dont think i cry out or thrash around or anything i just come to paralyzed with terror he says

you should wake me i say thinking about how i can interrupt his sleep two or three times on a bad night about how long it can take to calm me down

its not necessary my nightmares are usually about losing you he says im okay once i realize youre here

you know how they say you only hurt the ones you love well it works both ways

frees us of all the weight and pain of life

that word is love

the heart has its reasons which reason knows not

when i saw you i fell in love and you smiled because you knew

time was passing like a hand waving from a train i wanted to be on

i hope you never have to think about anything as much as i think about you

i fell in love with her when we were together then fell deeper in love with her in the years we were apart

the love of learning the sequestered nooks

and all the sweet serenity of books

what she had realized was that love was that moment when your heart was about to burst

trust your heart if the seas catch fire live by love though the stars walk backward

ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation

the emotion that can break your heart is sometimes the very one that heals it

sorrow is how we learn to love your heart isnt breaking it hurts because its getting larger the larger it gets the more love it holds

top  things money can’t buy

come sleep with me we wont make love love will make us

from childhoods hour i have not been as others were i have not seen as others saw i could not awaken my heart to joy at the same tone and all i loved i loved alone

the more one judges the less one loves

holding eleanors hand was like holding a butterfly or a heartbeat like holding something complete and completely alive

i guess that’s just part of loving people you have to give things up sometimes you even have to give them up

when god created mothers

when the good lord was creating mothers he was into his sixth day of overtime when the angel appeared and said youre doing a lot of fiddling around on this one

the angel shook her head slowly and said six pairs of hands no way

its not the hands that are causing me problems god remarked its the three pairs of eyes that mothers have to have

thats on the standard model asked the angel god nodded

god said the angel touching his sleeve gently get some rest tomorrow

i cant said god im so close to creating something so close to myself already i have one who heals herself when she is sickcan feed a family of six on one pound of hamburgerand can get a nine year old to stand under a shower

the angel circled the model of a mother very slowly its too soft she sighed

but tough said god excitedly you can imagine what this mother can do or endure

can it think

not only can it think but it can reason and compromise said the creator

finally the angel bent over and ran her finger across the cheek

theres a leak she pronounced i told you that you were trying to put too much into this model

its not a leak said the lord its a tear

whats it for

its for joy sadness disappointment pain loneliness and pride

you are a genius  said the angel

somberly god said i didnt put it there

if someone were to harm my family or a friend or somebody i love i would eat them i might end up in jail for  years but i would eat them

to be fully seen by somebody then and be loved anyhow  this is a human offering that can border on miraculous

i wonder how many people dont get the one they want but end up with the one theyre supposed to be with

when someone is in your heart theyre never truly gone they can come back to you even at unlikely times

sometimes love means letting go when you want to hold on tighter

in your light i learn how to love in your beauty how to make poems you dance inside my chest where noone sees you but sometimes i do and that sight becomes this art

dont cry over someone who wouldnt cry over you

absence diminishes small loves and increases great ones as the wind blows out the candle and fans the bonfire

were staying together he promised youre not getting away from me never again

i’ve been fighting to be who i am all my life what’s the point of being who i am if i can’t have the person who was worth all the fighting for

i want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me

to love life to love it even

when you have no stomach for it

and everything youve held dear

crumbles like burnt paper in your hands

your throat filled with the silt of it

when grief sits with you its tropical heat

thickening the air heavy as water

more fit for gills than lungs

when grief weights you like your own flesh

only more of it an obesity of grief

you think how can a body withstand this

then you hold life like a face

between your palms a plain face

no charming smile no violet eyes

and you say yes i will take you

i will love you again

being with you never felt wrong its the one thing i did right youre the one thing i did right

after

all this time

the sun never says to the earth

you owe me

what happens

with a love like that

it lights the whole sky

when you trip over love it is easy to get up but when you fall in love it is impossible to stand again

how do i love thee let me count the ways

i love thee to the depth and breadth and height

my soul can reach

stop fighting me he said trying to pull on the arm he held

he was in a precarious position himself straddling the rail as he tried to lean over far enough to get me and actually hold onto me

let go of me i yelled back

but he was too strong and managed to haul most of me over the rail enough so that i wasn’t in total danger of falling again

i looked him in the eye i will always love you

then i plunged the stake into his chest

that’s what i was supposed to say   he gasped out

those were his last words

this is where it all begins everything starts here today

true love is usually the most inconvenient kind

nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love

without you in my arms i feel an emptiness in my soul i find myself searching the crowds for your face  i know its an impossibility but i cannot help myself

i bet you could sometimes find all the mysteries of the universe in someones hand

watch out for intellect

because it knows so much it knows nothing

and leaves you hanging upside down

mouthing knowledge as your heart

falls out of your mouth

the things we love destroy us every time lad remember that

the sunlight claps the earth and the moonbeams kiss the sea what are all these kissings worth if thou kiss not me

to lose balance sometimes for love is part of living a balanced

the course of true love never did run smooth

i was always hungry for love just once i wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it  to be fed so much love i couldnt take any more just once

throw your dreams into space like a kite and you do not know what it will bring back a new life a new friend a new love a new country

my wish is that you may be loved to the point of madness

the world was collapsing and the only thing that really mattered to me was that she was alive

if we have no peace it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other

if you love something set it free but dont be surprised if it comes back with herpes

this is what we call love when you are loved you can do anything in creation when you are loved theres no need at all to understand whats happening because everything happens within you

i wont ever leave you even though youre always leaving me

sometimes you dont need a goal in life you dont need to know the big picture you just need to know what youre going to do next

i love you as certain dark things are loved secretly between the shadow and the soul

love is    being happy for the other person when they are happy being sad for the person when they are sad being together in good times and being together in bad times

love is the source of strength

love is    being honest with yourself at all times being honest with the other person at all times telling listening respecting the truth and never pretending

love is the source of reality

love is    an understanding so complete that you feel as if you are a part of the other person accepting the other person just the way they are and not trying to change them to be something else

love is the source of unity

love is    the freedom to pursue your own desires while sharing your experiences with the other person the growth of one individual alongside of and together with the growth of another individual

love is the source of success

love is    the excitement of planning things together the excitement of doing things together

love is the source of the future

love is    the fury of the storm the calm in the rainbow

love is the source of passion

love is    giving and taking in a daily situation being patient with each others needs and desires

love is the source of sharing

love is    knowing that the other person will always be with you regardless of what happens missing the other person when they are away but remaining near in heart at all times

love is the source of security

love is    the source of life

sex is the consolation you have when you cant have love

i want to know where to touch you i want to know how to touch you i want to know convince you to design a smile just for me yes i do want to be your friend i want to be your best friend in the entire world

about all you can do in life is be who you are some people will love you for you most will love you for what you can do for them and some wont like you at all

i sought to hear the voice of god and climbed the topmost steeple but god declared go down again  i dwell among the people

romance is the glamour which turns the dust of everyday life into a golden haze

in a perfect world you could fuck people without giving them a piece of your heart and every glittering kiss and every touch of flesh is another shard of heart you’ll never see again

for my part i prefer my heart to be broken it is so lovely dawnkaleidoscopic within the crack

we are not trapped or locked up in these bones no no we are free to change and love changes us and if we can love one another we can break open the sky

if he loved with all the powers of his puny being he couldnt love as much in eighty years as i could in a day

someday youre gonna look back on this moment of your life as such a sweet time of grieving youll see that you were in mourning and your heart was broken but your life was changing

for where all love is the speaking is unnecessary

ok you fuck me then snub me you love me you hate me you show me a sensitive side then you turn into a total asshole is this a pretty accurate description of our relationship

the soul is healed by being with children

you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince

sometimes when im alone i take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train the kisses in the arena

we are who we are be­cause of those we choose to love and be­cause of those who love us

when i look in the mirror i know i’m looking at someone who isn’t sure she deserves to be loved at all

dont waste your love on somebody who doesnt value it

yet each man kills the thing he loves

by each let this be heard

some do it with a bitter look

some with a flattering word

the coward does it with a kiss

the brave man with a sword

the human heart is a strange vessel love and hatred can exist side by side

yours is the light by which my spirits born  you are my sun my moon and all my stars

spending time with you showed me what i’ve been missing in my life

it is possible to be in love with you just because of who you are

if you can love someone with your whole heart even one person then theres salvation in life even if you cant get together with that person

i know enough to know that no woman should ever marry a man who hated his mother

i know thats what people say youll get over it id say it too but i know its not true oh youll be happy again never fear but you wont forget every time you fall in love it will be because something in the man reminds you of him

deny thy father refuse thy name thou art thyself thou not a montegue what is montegue tis nor hand nor foot nor any other part belonging to a man

what is in a name

that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet

so romeo would were he not romeo called retain such dear perfection to which he owes without that title

and for that name which is no part of thee take all thyself

if only she could be so oblivious again to feel such love without knowing it mistaking it for laughter

i almost wish we were butterflies and livd but three summer days  three such days with you i could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain

and what would humans be without love

the music in his laughter had a way of rounding off the missing notes in her soul

each of us is born with a box of matches inside us but we cant strike them all by ourselves

love is how you stay alive even after you are gone

of course you can have a true shadowhunter name will said you can have mine

tessa stared at him all black and white against the blackandwhite snow and stone your name

the moment we begin to seek love love begins to seek us and to save us

its not how much we give but how much love we put into giving

i love mankind he said but i find to my amazement that the more i love mankind as a whole the less i love man in particular

hearts are breakable isabelle said and i think even when you heal youre never what you were before

is it possible in the final analysis for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another

in youth it was a way i had

to do my best to please

and change with every passing lad

to suit his theories

but now i know the things i know

and do the things i do

and if you do not like me so

to hell my love with you

the highest function of love is that it makes the loved one a unique and irreplaceable being

anxiety is loves greatest killer it makes others feel as you might when a drowning man holds on to you you want to save him but you know he will strangle you with his panic

thats what people do who love you they put their arms around you and love you when youre not so lovable

the really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline and effort and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty little unsexy ways every day

love ive come to understand is more than three words mumbled before bedtime

it was many and many a year ago

in a kingdom by the sea

that a maiden there lived whom you may know

by the name of annabel lee

and this maiden she lived with no other thought

than to love and be loved by me

i was a child and she was a child

in this kingdom by the sea

but we loved with a love that was more than love

i and my annabel lee

with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven

coveted her and me

and this was the reason that long ago

in this kingdom by the sea

a wind blew out of a cloud chilling

my beautiful annabel lee

so that her highborn kinsman came

and bore her away from me

to shut her up in a sepulchre

in this kingdom by the sea

the angels not half so happy in heaven

went envying her and me

yes that was the reason as all men know

in this kingdom by the sea

that the wind came out of the cloud by night

chilling and killing my annabel lee

but our love it was stronger by far than the love

of those who were older than we

of many far wiser than we

and neither the angels in heaven above

nor the demons down under the sea

can ever dissever my soul from the soul

of the beautiful annabel lee

for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams

of the beautiful annabel lee

and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes

of the beautiful annabel lee

and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side

of my darling my darling my life and my bride

in the sepulchre there by the sea

in her tomb by the sounding sea

by the time you swear youre his

shivering and sighing

and he vows his passion is

lady make note of this

one of you is lying

sometimes god allows what he hates to accomplish what he loves

and next time youre planning to injure yourself to get me attention just remember that a little sweet talk works wonders

let yourself be drawn by the stronger pull of that which you truly love

its hard being left behind  its hard to be the one who stays

id learned that some things are best kept secret

she was my dream she made me who i am and holding her in my arms was more natural to me than my own heartbeat i think about her all the time even now when im sitting here i think about her there could never have been another

we are told that people stay in love because of chemistry or because they remain intrigued with each other because of many kindnesses because of luck but part of it has got to be forgiveness and gratefulness

so it’s true when all is said and done grief is the price we pay for love

good night good night parting is such sweet sorrow

that i shall say good night till it be morrow

love is not the absence of logic

but logic examined and recalculated

heated and curved to fit

inside the contours of the heart

of course i’ll hurt you of course you’ll hurt me of course we will hurt each other but this is the very condition of existence to become spring means accepting the risk of winter to become presence means accepting the risk of absence

let me not to the marriage of true minds

admit impediments love is not love

which alters when it alteration finds

or bends with the remover to remove

o no it is an everfixed mark

that looks on tempests and is never shaken

it is the star to every wandring barque

whose worths unknown although his height be taken

loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks

within his bending sickles compass come

love alters not with his brief hours and weeks

but bears it out even to the edge of doom

if this be error and upon me proved

i never writ nor no man ever loved

i have feelings too i am still human all i want is to be loved for myself and for my talent

true love is not so much a matter of romance as it is a matter of anxious concern for the wellbeing of ones companion

despite your best efforts people are going to be hurt when its time for them to be hurt

just because youre beautiful and perfect its made you conceited

it happens like this

its so dark right now i cant see any light around me

thats because the light is coming from you you cant see it but everyone else can

i wondered what happened when you offered yourself to someone and they opened you only to discover you were not the gift they expected and they had to smile and nod and say thank you all the same

i like my body when it is with your

body it is so quite new a thing

muscles better and nerves more

i like your body i like what it does

i like its hows i like to feel the spine

of your body and its bones and the trembling

firmsmooth ness and which i will

again and again and again

kiss i like kissing this and that of you

i like slowly stroking the shocking fuzz

of your electric fur and whatisit comes

over parting flesh  and eyes big lovecrumbs

and possibly i like the thrill

of under me you so quite new

i told you you dont love someone because of their looks or their clothes or their car you love them because they sing a song only your heart can understand

no woman wants to be in submission to a man who isnt in submission to god

moments when lost cant be found again theyre just gone

and he suddenly knew that if she killed herself he would die maybe not immediately maybe not with the same blinding rush of pain but it would happen you couldnt live for very long without a heart

ill fight it ill fight it for you dont you worry about me hazel grace im okay ill find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time

romance is thinking about your significant other when you are supposed to be thinking about something else

when its gone youll know what a gift love was youll suffer like this so go back and fight to keep it

you are the one girl that made me risk eveything for a future worth having

love possesses not nor would it be possessed for love is sufficient unto love and think not you can direct the course of love if it finds you worthy directs your course love has no other desire but to fulfil itself

love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get  only with what you are expecting to give  which is everything

there is always something left to love

if you forget me

i want you to know

you know how this is

if i look

at the crystal moon at the red branch

of the slow autumn at my window

if i touch

near the fire

the impalpable ash

or the wrinkled body of the log

everything carries me to you

as if everything that exists

were little boats

that sail

toward those isles of yours that wait for me

well now

if little by little you stop loving me

i shall stop loving you little by little

if suddenly

you forget me

do not look for me

for i shall already have forgotten you

if you think it long and mad

the wind of banners

that passes through my life

and you decide

to leave me at the shore

of the heart where i have roots

that on that day

at that hour

i shall lift my arms

and my roots will set off

to seek another land

but

if each day

each hour

you feel that you are destined for me

with implacable sweetness

if each day a flower

climbs up to your lips to seek me

ah my love ah my own

in me all that fire is repeated

in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten

my love feeds on your love beloved

and as long as you live it will be in your arms

goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes because for those who love with heart and soul there is no such thing as separation

she wanted something else something different something more passion and romance perhaps or maybe quiet conversations in candlelit rooms or perhaps something as simple as not being second

why are old lovers able to become friends two reasons they never truly loved each other or they love each other still

if youre a bird im a bird

real isnt how you are made said the skin horse its a thing that happens to you when a child loves you for a long long time not just to play with but really loves you then you become real

does it hurt asked the rabbit

sometimes said the skin horse for he was always truthful when you are real you dont mind being hurt

does it happen all at once like being wound up he asked or bit by bit

love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real

what are the chances you’d ever meet someone like that he wondered someone you could love forever someone who would forever love you back and what did you do when that person was born half a world away the math seemed impossible

its bullshit to think of friendship and romance as being different theyre not theyre just variations of the same love variations of the same desire to be close

to say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around is a paradox people eventually get sick of waiting take a chance on someone and by the art of commitment become soulmates which takes a lifetime to perfect

i belong to my beloved and my beloved is mine

the heart is the toughest part of the body

tenderness is in the hands

true love comes quietly without banners or flashing lights if you hear bells get your ears checked

in desperate love we always invent the characters of our partners demanding they be what we need of them and then feeling devastated when they refuse to perform the role we created in the first place

if my love were an ocean

there would be no more land

if my love were a desert

you would see only sand

if my love were a star

late at night only light

and if my love could grow wings

id be soaring in flight

love n a temporary insanity curable by marriage

i um i have this problem i broke up with my boyfriend you see and im pretty upset about it so i wanted to talk to my best friend  the thing is theyre both you

well ron said finally looking up at harry how was it

harry considered it for a moment wet he said truthfully

ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust it was hard to tell

because she was crying harry continued heavily

oh said ron his smile faded slightly are you that bad at kissing

dunno said harry who hadnt considered this and immediately felt rather worried maybe i am

love it never dies it never goes away it never fades so long as you hang on to it love can make you immortal

someday youll find someone special again people whove been in love once usually do its in their nature

i wonder if fears ever really go away or if they just lose their power over us

there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people

you say you love rain but you use an umbrella to walk under it you say you love sun but you seek shelter when it is shining you say you love wind but when it comes you close your windows so thats why im scared when you say you love me

we rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new but to feel nothing so as not to feel anything  what a waste

what greater gift than the love of a cat

you only need one man to love you but him to love you free like a wildfire crazy like the moon always like tomorrow sudden like an inhale and overcoming like the tides only one man and all of this

and to the devil with it if she is said the consul one girl who is not nephilim is not cannot be our priority

she is my priority will shouted

theres a difference between really loving someone and loving the idea of her

we are all the pieces of what we remember we hold in ourselves the hopes and fears of those who love us as long as there is love and memory there is no true loss

every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own in pain and sickness it would still be dear

if a thing loves it is infinite

name one hero who was happy

i considered heracles went mad and killed his family theseus lost his bride and father jasons children and new wife were murdered by his old bellerophon killed the chimera but was crippled by the fall from pegasus back

you cant he was sitting up now leaning forward

i cant

i know they never let you be famous and happy he lifted an eyebrow ill tell you a secret

tell me i loved it when he was like this

im going to be the first he took my palm and held it to his swear it

why me

because youre the reason swear it

i swear it i said lost in the high color of his cheeks the flame in his eyes

i swear it he echoed

we sat like that a moment hands touching he grinned

i feel like i could eat the world raw

it doesnt matter who you are or what you look like so long as somebody loves you

after all this time

trust no friend without faults and love a woman but no angel

we must love one another or die

you are like nobody since i love you

oh no dont smile youll kill me i stop breathing when you smile

i think it is all a matter of love the more you love a memory the stronger and stranger it becomes

the best things in life make you sweaty

my great hope is to laugh as much as i cry to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return

in love no question is ever preposterous

the greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved  loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves

love is a better master than duty

because if you could love someone and keep loving them without being loved back    then that love had to be real it hurt too much to be anything else

happily ever after or even just together ever after is not cheesy wren said it’s the noblest like the most courageous thing two people can shoot for

im out in the woods i am out on my own

i found me a werewolf a nasty old mutt

it showed me its teeth and went straight for my gut

im out in the woods i am out on my own

i was stopped by a vampire a rotting old wreck

it showed me its teeth and went straight for my neck

mama mama put me to bed

i wont make it home im already halfdead

i met an invalid and fell for his art

he showed me his smile and went straight for my heart

from a childs walk home nursery rhymes and folk tales

i think we ought to live happily ever after

no matter how much you think you love somebody youll step back when the pool of their blood edges up too close

he is beauty inside and out

he is the silver lining in a world of darkness

he is my light

she didnt understand that how can anyone be afraid of love

hiding how you really feel and trying to make everyone happy doesnt make you nice it just makes you a liar

his voice dropped nearly to a whisper and his arms tightened around me

lord ye gave me a rare woman and god i loved her well

the scariest thing about distance is that you don’t know whether they’ll miss you or forget you

its okay he said were together he didnt say youre okay or were alive after all theyd been through over the last year he knew that the most important thing was that they were together she loved him for saying that

believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it

in real life love has to be possible even if it is not returned right away love can only survive when the hope exists that you will be able to win over the person you desire

nothing ever happens like you imagine it will

no dimitri interrupted gently he moved his face toward mine our foreheads nearly touching it wont happen to you youre too strong youll fight it just like you did this

i only did because you were here he wrapped his arms around me and i buried my face in his chest i cant do it by myself i whispered

you can he said there was a tremulous note in his voice youre strong—youre so so strong its why i love you

love is an abstract noun something nebulous and yet love turns out to be the only part of us that is solid as the world turns upside down and the screen goes black

we cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known and when we honor the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust respect kindness and affection

love is not something we give or get it is something that we nurture and grow a connection that can only be cultivated between two people when it exists within each one of them – we can only love others as much as we love ourselves

shame blame disrespect betrayal and the withholding of affection damage the roots from which love grows love can only survive these injuries if they are acknowledged healed and rare

love and compassion are necessities not luxuries without them humanity cannot survive

the fate of your heart is your choice and no one else gets a vote

the damage was permanent there would always be scars but even the angriest scars faded over time until it was difficult to see them written on the skin at all and the only thing that remained was the memory of how painful it had been

unless you love someone nothing else makes sense

love cannot be reduced to a catalogue of reasons why and a catalogue of reasons cannot be put together into love

he stared at her knowing with certainty that he was falling in love he pulled her close and kissed her beneath a blanket of stars wondering how on earth hed been lucky enough to find her

we are all worthy of one another

do i love you my god if your love were a grain of sand mine would be a universe of beaches

with him life was routine without him life was unbearable

the day the power of love overrules the love of power the world will know peace

the great tragedy of life is not that men perish but that they cease to love

i don’t know what they are called the spaces between seconds– but i think of you always in those intervals

if someone thinks that peace and love are just a cliche that must have been left behind in the s thats a problem peace and love are eternal

anyone who loves in the expectation of being loved in return is wasting their time

if theres a thing ive learned in my life its to not be afraid of the responsibility that comes with caring for other people what we do for love those things endure even if the people you do them for dont

those sweet lips my oh my i could kiss those lips all night long

good things come to those who wait

i have never found anybody who could stand to accept the daily demonstrative love i feel in me and give back as good as i give

the only thing more unthinkable than leaving was staying the only thing more impossible than staying was leaving

because of you in gardens of blossoming

flowers i ache from the perfumes of spring

i have forgotten your face i no longer

remember your hands how did your lips

because of you i love the white statues

drowsing in the parks the white statues that

have neither voice nor sight

i have forgotten your voice your happy voice

i have forgotten your eyes

like a flower to its perfume i am bound to

my vague memory of you i live with pain

that is like a wound if you touch me you will

make to me an irreperable harm

your caresses enfold me like climbing

i have forgotten your love yet i seem to

glimpse you in every window

because of you the heady perfumes of

summer pain me because of you i again

seek out the signs that precipitate desires

snapes patronus was a doe said harry the same as my mothers because he loved her for nearly all of his life from when they were children

accept the things to which fate binds you and love the people with whom fate brings you togetherbut do so with all your heart

you two are too cute the counter girl said setting two cups piled with whipped cream on the counter she had a sort of lopsided open smile that made me think she laughed a lot seriously how long have you been going out

sam let go of my hands to get his wallet and took out some bills six years

i wrinkled my nose to cover a laugh of course he would count the time that we’d been two entirely different species

whoa counter girl nodded appreciatively that’s pretty amazing for a couple your age

sam handed me my hot chocolate and didn’t answer but his yellow eyes gazed at me possessively—i wondered if he realized that the way he looked at me was far more intimate than copping a feel could ever be

i crouched to look at the almond bark on the bottom shelf in the counter i wasn’t quite bold enough to look at either of them when i admitted well it was love at first sight

the girl sighed that is just so romantic do me a favor and don’t you two ever change the world needs more love at first sight

if you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart then youre allowing them to hurt you a second time in your mind

the moment you stop to think about whether you love someone youve already stopped loving that person forever

i may not always be with you

but when were far apart

remember you will be with me

right inside my heart

i know my heart will never be the same

but im telling myself ill be okay

love sucks sometimes it feels good sometimes its just another way to bleed

wherever you will go

i will let you down

but this lullaby goes on

love is a rebellious bird

that nobody can tame

and you call him quite in vain

if it suits him not to come

do what you love love what you do and with all your heart give yourself to it

youre like a song that i heard when i was a little kid but forgot i knew until i heard it again

when you love someone you say their name different like its safe inside your mouth

if i were to live a thousand years i would belong to you for all of them if we were to live a thousand lives i would want to make you mine in each one

it’s dark now and i am very tired i love you always time is nothing

im not sure this is a world i belong in anymore im not sure that i want to wake up

we always see our worst selves our most vulnerable selves we need someone else to get close enough to tell us we’re wrong someone we trust

if you can capture a womans imagination then you will have her but imagination is a strange creature it needs time and distance to function properly

the bible tells us to love our neighbors and also to love our enemies probably because generally they are the same people

shes drunk joe bell informed me

every true love and friendship is a story of unexpected transformation if we are the same person before and after we loved that means we havent loved enough

there aint no way you can hold onto something that wants to go you understand you can only love what you got while you got it

ye are blood of my blood and bone of my bone

i give ye my body that we two might be one

i give ye my spirit til our life shall be done

its funny how you can forget everything except people loving you maybe thats why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs its not the pain theyre getting over its the love

we could do it you know

what

leave the district run off live in the woods you and i we could make it

heaven would never be heaven without you

shall i compare thee to a summers day

thou art more lovely and more temperate

rough winds do shake the darling buds of may

and summers lease hath all too short a date

sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines

and too often is his gold complexion dimmd

and every fair from fair sometimes declines

by chance or natures changing course untrimmd

by thy eternal summer shall not fade

nor lose possession of that fair thou owest

nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade

when in eternal lines to time thou growest

so long as men can breathe or eyes can see

so long lives this and this gives life to thee

what would you do if i kissed you right now

i stared at his beautiful face and his beautiful mouth and i wanted nothing more than to taste it i would kiss you back

you really love her dont you she said

with all my heart

she looked as sad as id ever seen her

whats your heart telling you to do

i dont know

maybe she said gentlyyoure trying to hard to hear it

to fear love is to fear life and those who fear life are already parts dead

if you ever looked at me once with what i know is in you i would be your slave

im saying im in love with you ive been in love with you this whole bleeding year

we cant he told me

parents were the only ones obligated to love you from the rest of the world you had to earn it

my mother she is beautiful softened at the edges and tempered with a spine of steel i want to grow old and be like her

im like you he said i remember everything

love recognizes no barriers it jumps hurdles leaps fences penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope

were all a little weird and life is a little weird and when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness — and call it love — true love

you have a remarkable memory

i remember everything about you youre the one who wasnt paying attention

in the darkness two shadows reaching through the hopeless heavy dusk their hands meet and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun

morning without you is a dwindled dawn

some people feel like they dont deserve love they walk away quietly into empty spaces trying to close the gaps of the past

its not that you should never love something so much that it can control you

its that you need to love something that much so you can never be controlled

its not a weakness

its your best strength

whenever you are confronted with an opponent conquer him with love

ginny listeni cant be involved with you anymore weve got to stop seeing each other we cant be together

its for some stupid noble reason isnt it

what if i dont care

i care how do you think id feel if this was your funeraland it was my fault

she wasnt doing a thing that i could see except standing there leaning on the balcony railing holding the universe together

you are my life now

anyone can love a thing because thats as easy as putting a penny in your pocket

but to love something despite to know the flaws and love them too that is rare and pure and perfect

the strongest love is the love that can demonstrate its fragility

i dreamed i spoke in anothers language

i dreamed i lived in anothers skin

i dreamed i was my own beloved

i dreamed i was a tigers kin

i dreamed that eden lived inside me

and when i breathed a garden came

i dreamed i knew all of creation

i dreamed i knew the creators name

i dreamedand this dream was the finest

that all i dreamed was real and true

and we would live in joy forever

you in me and me in you

i love you t

if you love a flower that lives on a star it is sweet to look at the sky at night all the stars are abloom with flowers

its the imperfections that make things beautiful

one day spent with someone you love can change everything

being with you and not being with you is the only way i have to measure time

i envy people that know love that have someone who takes them as they are

if i die i will wait for you do you understand no matter how long i will watch from beyond to make sure you live every year you have to its fullest and then we’ll have so much to talk about when i see you again… bones

there is no love sincerer than the love of food

love is a luxury

no love is an element

an element like air to breathe earth to stand on

i know that the whole point—the only point—is to

find the things that matter and hold on to them and fight for them and refuse to

let them go

when in a relationship a real man doesnt make his woman jealous of others he makes others jealous of his woman

sleep my little babyoh

sleep until you waken

when you wake youll see the world

if im not mistaken

find your name

and buried treasure

face your life

its pain

its pleasure

leave no path untaken

she is a friend of my mind she gather me man the pieces i am she gather them and give them back to me in all the right order

i dont care if youre black white straight bisexual gay lesbian short tall fat skinny rich or poor if youre nice to me ill be nice to you simple as that

love the reason i dislike that word is that it means too much for me far more than you can understand

her heart was a secret garden and the walls were very high

his heart danced upon her movements like a cork upon a tide he heard what her eyes said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim past whether in life or revery he had heard their tale before

i will not try to convince you to love me to respect me to commit to me i deserve better than that i am better than thatgoodbye

remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other

when you have seen as much of life as i have you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love

friends are the family you choose  ninithilnin elven rogue

i can write the saddest poem of all tonight

write for instance the night is full of stars

and the stars blue shiver in the distance

the night wind whirls in the sky and sings

i can write the saddest poem of all tonight

i loved her and sometimes she loved me too

on nights like this i held her in my arms

i kissed her so many times under the infinite sky

she loved me sometimes i loved her

how could i not have loved her large still eyes

i can write the saddest poem of all tonight

to think i dont have her to feel that ive lost her

to hear the immense night more immense without her

and the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass

what does it matter that my love couldnt keep her

the night is full of stars and she is not with me

thats all far away someone sings far away

my soul is lost without her

as if to bring her near my eyes search for her

my heart searches for her and she is not with me

the same night that whitens the same trees

we we who were we are the same no longer

i no longer love her true but how much i loved her

my voice searched the wind to touch her ear

someone elses she will be someone elses as she once

belonged to my kisses

i no longer love her true but perhaps i love her

love is so short and oblivion so long

because on nights like this i held her in my arms

my soul is lost without her

although this may be the last pain she causes me

and this may be the last poem i write for her

unrequited love does not die its only beaten down to a secret place where it hides curled and wounded for some unfortunates it turns bitter and mean and those who come after pay the price for the hurt done by the one who came before

i have a million things to talk to you about all i want in this world is you i want to see you and talk i want the two of us to begin everything from the beginning

please mia he implores dont make me write a song

love is like a brick you can build a house or you can sink a dead body

if i love you what business is it of yours

love the poet said is womans whole existence

it is an absolute human certainty that no one can know his own beauty or perceive a sense of his own worth until it has been reflected back to him in the mirror of another loving caring human being

i met an old lady once almost a hundred years old and she told me there are only two questions that human beings have ever fought over all through history how much do you love me and whos in charge

all my heart is yours sir it belongs to you and with you it would remain were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence forever

maybe i was destined to forever fall in love with people i couldn’t have maybe there’s a whole assortment of impossible people waiting for me to find them waiting to make me feel the same impossibility over and over again

someday we’ll run into each other again i know it

maybe i’ll be older and smarter and just plain better if that happens

that’s when i’ll deserve you but now at this moment you can’t hook

your boat to mine because i’m liable to sink us both

i know youre tired but come this is the way

how can i be reasonable to me our love was everything and you were my whole life it is not very pleasant to realize that to you it was only an episode

keep your best wishes close to your heart and watch what happens

the great thing to remember is that though our feelings come and go gods love for us does not

ive always loved you and when you love someone you love the whole person just as he or she is and not as you would like them to be

i dont care what you say to me i care what you share with me

in this world it is too common for people to search for someone to lose themselves in but i am already lost i will look for someone to find myself in

the voice of love seemed to call to me but it was a wrong number

when you are old

when you are old and grey and full of sleep

and nodding by the fire take down this book

and slowly read and dream of the soft look

your eyes had once and of their shadows deep

how many loved your moments of glad grace

and loved your beauty with love false or true

but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you

and loved the sorrows of your changing face

and bending down beside the glowing bars

murmur a little sadly how love fled

and paced upon the mountains overhead

and hid his face amid a crowd of stars

promise to give me a kiss on my brow when i am dead i shall feel it

and by the way monsieur marius i believe that i was a little bit in love with you

stephen kissed me in the spring

robin in the fall

but colin only looked at me

and never kissed at all

stephen’s kiss was lost in jest

robin’s lost in play

but the kiss in colin’s eyes

haunts me night and day

hes not your prince charming if he doesnt make sure you know that youre his princess

this is love to fly toward a secret sky to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment first to let go of life finally to take a step without feet

i love you more than i think i should

i belong to the people i love and they belong to methey and the love and loyaty i give them form my identity far more than any word or group ever could

dont leave a piece of jewelry at his house so you can go back and get it later he may be with his real girlfriend

one ought to hold on to ones heart for if one lets it go one soon loses control of the head too

if you want some advice—which im sure you dont—you guys should lay off on the magic christian still thinks youre moving in on lissa

what he asked in mock astonishment doesnt he know my heart belongs to you

it does not and no hes still worried about it despite what ive told him

you know i bet if we started making out right now it would make him feel better

if you touch me i said pleasantly ill provide you with the opportunity to see if you can heal yourself then wed see how badass you really are

when you love someone you let them take care of you

love makes you want to be a better man—right right but maybe love real love also gives you permission to just be the man you are

a thousand halfloves must be forsaken to take one whole heart home

nothing in this world was more difficult than love

love is heavy and light bright and dark hot and cold sick and healthy asleep and awake its everything except what it is act  scene

in silence i grieve

that thy heart could forget

if i should meet thee

after long years

how should i greet thee

with silence and tears

maybe there isn’t such a thing as fate maybe it’s just the opportunities we’re given and what we do with them i’m beginning to think that maybe great epic romances don’t just happen we have to make them ourselves

there is love in holding and there is love in letting go

falling for him would be like cliff diving it would be either the most exhilarating thing that ever happened to me or the stupidest mistake i’d ever make

one day when i am a braver man i will tell her these things and then i will look her in the eye tell her i love her and ask her to be only mine but until that day were just friends

in this part of the story i am the one who

dies the only one and i will die of love because i love you

because i love you love in fire and in blood

no human relation gives one possession in another—every two souls are absolutely different in friendship or in love the two side by side raise hands together to find what one cannot reach alone

he suddenly recalled from platos symposium people were hermaphrodites until god split then in two and now all the halves wander the world over seeking one another love is the longing for the half of ourselves we have lost

i love you remember they cannot take it

i have little left in myself  i must have you the world may laugh  may call me absurd selfish  but it does not signify my very soul demands you it will be satisfied or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame

love is scary it changes it can go away thats the part of the risk i dont want to be scared anymore

because i cant help doing it he said with a shrug and hey if i keep loving you maybe youll eventually crack and love me too hell im pretty sure youre already half in love with me

i am not and everything you just said is ridiculous thats terrible logic

i dont think youre evil

see things are already looking promising

the future for me is already a thing of the past

you were my first love and you will be my last

if i know what love is it is because of you

after all these years i see that i was mistaken about eve in the beginning it is better to live outside the garden with her than inside it without her

if i could but know his heart everything would become easy

why is love intensified by absence

they do not love that do not show their love

four be the things i am wiser to know

idleness sorrow a friend and a foe

four be the things id been better without

love curiosity freckles and doubt

three be the things i shall never attain

envy content and sufficient champagne

three be the things i shall have till i die

laughter and hope and a sock in the eye

how far should a person go in the name of true love

we kiss all the time i clear my throat then add we justdo it in private

a smug expression crosses his face i dont buy it for a second cause if you were my girlfriend and a stud like me was livin in your house id kiss you in front of the guy every chance i got as a reminder

a reminder of wwwhat

that you were mine

he could totally be your boyfriend angel went on with annoying persistance you guys could get married i could be like a junior bridesmaid total could be your flower dog

im only a kid i shrieked i cant get married

you could in new hampshire

my mouth dropped open how does she know this stuff forget it no ones getting married i hissed not in new hampshire or anywhere else not in a box not with a fox now go to sleep before i kill you

woman is sacred the woman one loves is holy

each day brings new opportunities allowing you to constantly live with love—be there for others—bring a little light into someones day be grateful and live each day to the fullest

if i were a tree i would have no reason to love a human

there is no pretendingjace said with absolute clarityi love youand i will love you until i dieand if theres a life after thatill love you then

she caught her breathhe had said itthe words there was no going back from

to love someone means to see them as god intended them

if you truly want to be respected by people you love you must prove to them that you can survive without them

if i have learned anything in this long life of mine it is this in love we find out who we want to be in war we find out who we are

i mean at the end of the day what the hell does it matter who i end up with if it cant be you

it is a long way to ireland janet and i am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels but if i cant do better how is it to be helped are you anything akin to me do you think jane

i could risk no sort of answer by this time my heart was still

though lovers be lost love shall not and death shall have no dominion

life is a series of pulls back and forth a tension of opposites like a pull on a rubber band most of us live somewhere in the middle a wrestling matchwhich side win love wins love always wins

do not swear by the moon for she changes constantly then your love would also change

im gonna fight for you until your heart stops beating

the love that moves the sun and the other stars

last time i saw you i said that it hurt too much to love you but i was wrong about that the truth is it hurts too much not to love you

live your truth express your love share your enthusiasm take action towards your dreams walk your talk dance and sing to your music embrace your blessings make today worth remembering

i wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul

love is our true destiny we do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone  we find it with another

i want love to conquer all but love cant conquer anything it cant do anything on its own

it relies on us to do the conquering on its behalf

ah what happiness it is to be with people who are all happy to press hands press cheeks smile into eyes

love is a serious mental disease

kissing  and i mean like yummy smacking kissing  is the most delicious most beautiful and passionate thing that two people can do bar none better than sex hands down

yelena youve driven me crazy youve caused me considerable trouble and ive contemplated ending your life twice since ive known you valeks warm breath in my ear sent a shiver down my spine

but you’ve slipped under my skin invaded my blood and seized my heart

that sounds more like a poison than a person was all i could say his confession had both shocked and thrilled me

exactly valek replied you have poisoned me

and all i loved i loved alone

who pays any attention

to the syntax of things

will never wholly kiss you

wholly to be a fool

while spring is in the world

my blood approves

and kisses are a far better fate

than wisdom

lady i swear by all flowers dont cry

the best gesture of my brain is less than

your eyelids flutter which says

we are for eachother then

laugh leaning back in my arms

for lifes not a paragraph

and death i think is no parenthesis

there is no intensity of love or feeling that does not involve the risk of crippling hurt it is a duty to take this risk to love and feel without defense or reserve

the power of finding beauty in the humblest things makes home happy and life lovely

the tattoo is just setting below his hp bone

h e l l i s e m p t y

a n d a l l t h e d e v i l s a r e h e r e

i kiss my way across the words

kissing away the devils

kissing away the pain

you’ll never be able to find yourself if you’re lost in someone else

ronan said im always straight

adam replied oh man thats the biggest lie youve ever told

im a little pencil in the hand of a writing god who is sending a love letter to the world

and i wondered if love was too weak a word for what he felt what he’d done for me for what i felt for him

how we need another soul to cling to another body to keep us warm to rest and trust to give your soul in confidence i need this i need someone to pour myself into

i dont know if anyones ever told you this he begins he doesnt blush and his eyes dont dart away instead i find myself staring into a pair of oceans  one perfect the other blemished by that tiny ripple youre very attractive

a slow grin spreads across his face oh trust me i know

i wish you could be kissed jane he said because i would beg just one off you under all this he flailed an arm toward the stars

each relationship between two persons is absolutely unique that is why you cannot love two people the same it simply is not possible you love each person differently because of who they are and the uniqueness that they draw out of you

i have seen the best of you and the worst of you and i choose both

you’ve changed me forever and i’ll never forget you

if you dont receive love from the ones who are meant to love you you will never stop looking for it

but if i hadnt fallen i wouldnt have met you

sometimes it takes a heartbreak to shake us awake  help us see we are worth so much more than were settling for

loving someone and having them love you back is the most precious thing in the world

did i really want to stay on this road longer knowing it was only going to end in devastation

i want to try making things right because picking up the pieces is way better than leaving them the way they are

the story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye the story of love is hello and goodbyeuntil we meet again

then love knew it was called love

and when i lifted my eyes to your name

suddenly your heart showed me my way

let me die the moment my love dies

let me not outlive my own capacity to love

let me die still loving and so never die

he broke off then as if realizing everyone was looking at him again

you want what said dru with enormous eyes

nothing julian said im just talking

to love is to destroy and that to be loved is to be the one destroyed

you never knew the last time you were seeing someone you didnt know when the last argument happened or the last time you had sex or the last time you looked into their eyes and thanked god they were in your life

after they were gone

that was all you thought about

day and night

she wasnt exactly sure when it happened or even when it started all she knew for sure was that right here and now she was falling hard and she could only pray that he was feeling the same way

okay theni can talk ask me something

okay he laughs shakily in my ear why is your heart racing tris

i cringe and say well ii barely know you i barely know you and im crammed up against you in a box four what do you think

maybe you were cut out for candor he says because youre a terrible liar

there are memories that time does not erase forever does not make loss forgettable only bearable

when he died all things soft and beautiful and bright would be buried with him

moving on is easy its staying moved on thats trickier

a fit healthy body—that is the best fashion statement

forever and ever kid until youre sick and tired of seeing me

where there is great love there are always miracles

sometimes you want to say i love you but…

to say i love you but… is to say i did not love you at all

when you forgive you love and when you love god’s light shines upon you

there could have been no two hearts so open no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison

i dont love you anymore she whispered i dont love you at all his throat closed its all right sweetheart i love you enough for both of us

i miss him in so many ways but right now i miss him in the way you always miss someone when youre single among a room full of couples

when is a monster not a monster oh when you love it

i am certain of nothing but the holiness of the hearts affections and the truth of the imagination

you were the sun and i was crashing into you

people should fall in love with their eyes closed

id love to she finally saidon one condition

i steadied myself hoping it wasnt something too awful

you have to promise that you wont fall in love with me

i knew she was kidding me by the way she laughed and i couldnt help but breathe a sigh of relief

sometimes i had to admit jamie had a pretty good sense of humor

i smiled and gave her my word

are you upset little friend have you been lying awake worrying well dont worryim here the flood waters will recede the famine will end the sun will shine tomorrow and i will always be here to take care of you

i am a museum full of art

but you had your eyes shut

but when i do feel all the strength go out of me and i fall to my knees beside the table and i think i cry then or at least i want to and everything inside me screams for just one more kiss one more word one more glance one more

there comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page write another book or simply close it

you know that place between sleep and awake that place where you still remember dreaming that’s where i’ll always love you that’s where i’ll be waiting

one of the things that makes me who i am is the loyalty i have to people i hold close to my heart

love is the voice under all silences the hope which has no opposite in fear the strength so strong mere force is feebleness the truth more first than sun more last than star

love is the strangest most illogical thing in the world

dont go far off not even for a day

because i dont know how to say it  a day is long

and i will be waiting for you as in

an empty station when the trains are

parked off somewhere else asleep

dont leave me even for an hour because then

the little drops of anguish will all run together

the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift

into me choking my lost heart

oh may your silhouette never dissolve

on the beach may your eyelids never flutter

into the empty distance dont leave me for

a second my dearest because in that moment youll

have gone so far ill wander mazily

over all the earth asking will you

come back will you leave me here dying

christian you are the state lottery the cure for cancer and the three wishes from aladdins lamp all rolled into one

theyre in love fuck the war

life is funny things change people change but you will always be you so stay true to yourself and never sacrifice who you are for anyone

ive never minded it he went on being lost that is i had always thought one could not truly be lost if one knew ones own heart but i fear i may be lost without knowing yours

i knew they would kill me when they found out but… he struggled for words releasing a sharp breath i think i realized that i would rather die because i betrayed them than live because i betrayed you

don’t sacrifice yourself too much because if you sacrifice too much there’s nothing else you can give and nobody will care for you

to love means loving the unlovable to forgive means pardoning the unpardonable faith means believing the unbelievable hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless

weeping is not the same thing as crying it takes your whole body to weep and when its over you feel like you dont have any bones left to hold you up

i am no longer in love with her thats certain but maybe i love her love is so short forgetting is so long

adam smiled cheerily ronan would start wars and burn cities for that true smile elastic and amiable

until one has loved an animal a part of ones soul remains unawakened

i have been astonished that men could die martyrs

for their religion

i have shuddered at it

i shudder no more

i could be martyred for my religion

love is my religion

and i could die for that

i could die for you

my creed is love and you are its only tenet

dare to love yourself

as if you were a rainbow

with gold at both ends

to love is to recognize yourself in another

there is a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven

a time to be born and a time to die

a time to plant and a time to uproot

a time to kill and a time to heal

a time to tear down and a time to build

a time to weep and a time to laugh

a time to mourn and a time to dance

a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them

a time to embrace and a time to refrain

a time to search and a time to give up

a time to keep and a time to throw away

a time to tear and a time to mend

a time to be silent and a time to speak

a time to love and a time to hate

a time for war and a time for peace

my heart only ever had one thought one want one need despite all in spite of allall my heart has ever wanted is you

but in a solitary life there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours as stars once a year brush the earth such a constellation was he to me

how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive

did you know i always thought you were braver than me did you ever guess that that was why i was so afraid it wasnt that i only loved some of you but i wondered if you could ever love more than some of me

the lost boys all stood at our wedding does it seem odd to you that they could have stood at a wedding that wasnt yours and mine it does to me and im sorry for it and for a lot and i also wouldnt change it

your peter

ps please give my love to tink she was always such a funny little bug

and now i know why they invented words for love why they had to its the only thing that can come close to describing what i feel in that moment the baffling mixture of pain and pleasure and fear and joy all running sharply through me at once

i felt like an animal and animals don’t know sin do they

yeah well i say i left abnegation because i wasnt selfless enough no matter how hard i tried to be

thats not entirely true he smiles at me that girl who let someone throw knives at her to spare a friend who hit my dad with a belt to protect methat selfless girl thats not you

youve been paying close attention havent you

i like to observe people

maybe you were cut out for candor four because youre a terrible liar

love is not love

which alters when it alteration finds

or bends with the remover to remove

o no it is an everfixed mark

that looks on tempests and is never shaken

it is the star to every wandring bark

whose worths unknown although his height be taken

the only creatures that are evolved enough to convey pure love are dogs and infants

for one human being to love another human being that is perhaps the most difficult task that has been given to us the ultimate the final problem and proof the work for which all other work is merely preparation

limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns it calls me on and on across the universe

i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me

every woman wants a man wholl fall in love with her soul as well as her body

until this moment i had not realized that someone could break your heart twice along the very same fault lines

its the kind of kiss that inspires stars to climb into the sky and light up the world

true love is the best thing in the world except for cough drops

you are my heart my life my entire existence

you’re just another story i can’t tell anymore

actually that’s my secret — i can’t even talk about you to anybody because i don’t want any more people to know how wonderful you are

my soul sees its equal in you

i love you’ he whispered and kissed my brow ‘thorns and all

i ask the impossible love me forever

love me when all desire is gone

love me with the single mindedness of a monk

when the world in its entirety

and all that you hold sacred advise you

against it love me still more

when rage fills you and has no name love me

when each step from your door to our job tires you

love me and from job to home again love me love me

love me when youre bored

when every woman you see is more beautiful than the last

or more pathetic love me as you always have

not as admirer or judge but with

the compassion you save for yourself

in your solitude

love me as you relish your loneliness

the anticipation of your death

mysteries of the flesh as it tears and mends

love me as your most treasured childhood memory

and if there is none to recall

imagine one place me there with you

love me withered as you loved me new

love me as if i were forever

and i will make the impossible

by loving you loving you as i do

the only love that i really believe in is a mother’s love for her children

it does not matter how long you are spending on the earth how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received it is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters

ah she cried you look so cool

their eyes met and they stared together at each other alone in space with an effort she glanced down at the table

you always look so cool she repeated

she had told him that she loved him and tom buchanan saw

choose your love love your choice

i dont want to hurt you or anybody so please forget about me just try find yourself a better friend

then i discovered that being related is no guarantee of love

true love begins when nothing is looked for in return

i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon womans inconstancy songs and proverbs all talk of womans fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all written by men

as lovers the difference between men and women is that women can love all day long but men only at times

what you are is a fucking tragedy simon snow you literally couldnt be a bigger mess

he tries to kiss me but i pull back and you like that

i love it he says

why

because we match

when people fall in love they burst into flames

youre an expert at sorry and keeping the lines blurry

i didnt want to kiss you goodbye — that was the trouble — i wanted to kiss you good night — and theres a lot of difference

in my rush i hadn’t tied my shoelaces noah was now tying them for me

he looked up at me through his dark fringe of lashes and smiled the expression on his face melted me completely i knew i had the goofiest grin plastered on my lips and didn’t care

there he said as he finished tying the laces on my left shoe now you won’t fall

too late

some moments are nice some are

nicer some are even worth

about

and ive fallen

so hard

and yet ive known nothing like this terrible horrible paralyzing feeling i feel crippled desperate and out of control and it keeps getting worse every day i feel sick empty and somehow aching

love is a heartless bastard

there is nothing that is going to make people hate you more and love you more than telling the truth

youre gorgeous you old hag and if i could give you just one gift ever for the rest of your life it would be this confidence it would be the gift of confidence either that or a scented candle

i want everything with you america i want the holidays and the birthdays the busy season and lazy weekends i want peanut butter fingertips on my desk i want inside jokes and fights and everything i want a life with you

do i love you because youre beautiful or are you beautiful because i love you

love one another but make not a bond of love

let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls

but grief makes a monster out of us sometimes    and sometimes you say and do things to the people you love that you cant forgive yourself for

the more you love someone he came to think the harder it is to tell them it surprised him that strangers didnt stop each other on the street to say i love you

to fall in love with god is the greatest romance to seek him the greatest adventure to find him the greatest human achievement

a kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous

what about when someone doesnt need a shoulder what if they need the arms

how do i love thee let me count the ways

i love thee to the depth and breadth and height

my soul can reach when feeling out of sight

for the ends of being and ideal grace

i love thee to the level of every days

most quiet need by sun and candlelight

i love thee purely as they turn from praise

i love thee with the passion put to use

in my old griefs and with my childhoods faith

i love thee with a love i seemed to lose

with my lost saints i love thee with the breath

smiles tears of all my life and if god choose

i shall but love thee better after death

if you love deeply youre going to get hurt badly but its still worth it

damn you spoilt creature i shan’t make you love me any the more by giving myself away like this

you don’t take away my choices you are my choice

if you didnt love him this never would have happened but you did and accepting that love and everything that followed it is part of letting it go

there was beauty in the idea of freedom but it was an illusion every human heart was chained by love

are you gloating inside thats what this is about isnt it getting me to trust you so you could blow it up in my face

i get that youre angry— said patch

i am ripped apart i shouted

you picked a lemon throw it away lemonade is overrated freaks should remain at the circus not in your apartment you already have one asshole you don’t need another make a space in your life for the glorious things you deserve have faith

when you love someone its never over you move on because you have to but you take them with you in your heart

love meant jumping off a cliff and trusting that a certain person would be there to catch you at the bottom

love is being honest with yourself at all times

being honest with the other person at all times

telling listening respecting the truth

and never pretending

love is the source of reality

i find the best way to love someone is not to change them but instead help them reveal the greatest version of themselves

had i the heavens embroidered cloths

enwrought with golden and silver light

the blue and the dim and the dark cloths

of night and light and the half light

i would spread the cloths under your feet

but i being poor have only my dreams

i have spread my dreams under your feet

tread softly because you tread on my dreams

its all right said wolf you loved her i would feel the same if someone wanted to erase scarlets identity and give it to levanas army

scarlet stiffened heat rushing into her cheeks he certainly wasnt insinuating

aaaaw squealed iko did wolf just say that he loves scarlet thats so cute

scarlet cringed he did notthat wasnt she balled her fists against her sides can we get back to these soldiers that are being rounded up please

is she blushing she sounds like shes blushing

shes blushing thorne confirmed shuffling the cards actually wolf is also looking a little flustered

of all our games loves play is the only one which threatens to unsettle the soul

i will follow you to the ends of the world

this is what happened in love one of you cried a lot and then both of you grew sarcastic

amor fati – love your fate which is in fact your life

there is a good deal of comfort now in remembering this

be the one who nurtures and builds be the one who has an understanding and a forgiving heart one who looks for the best in people leave people better than you found them

autumn is the hardest season the leaves are all falling and theyre falling like

theyre falling in love with the ground

fear doesnt shut you down it wakes you up ive seen it its fascinating he releases me but doesnt pull away his hand grazing my jaw my neck sometimes i justwant to see it again want to see you awake

he did not care if she was heartless vicious and vulgar stupid and grasping he loved her he would rather have misery with one than happiness with the other

how could i have ever been ashamed of loving dante quintana

i dont care if you danced naked on the roof of the little palace with him i love you alina even the part of you that loved him

i cant set my hopes too high

cause every hello ends with a goodbye

if you love something so much let it go if it comes back it was meant to be if it doesnt it never was

would you destroy something perfect in order to make it beautiful

what irritated me most in that entire situation was the fact that i

wasn’t feeling humiliated or annoyed or even fooled betrayal was

what i felt my heart broken not just by a guy i was in love with but

also by as i once believed a true friend

when you love someone you dont have a choice love takes your choices away

augustus i said really you dont have to do this

sure i do he said i found my wish

god youre the best i told him

i bet you say that to all the boys who finance your international travel he answered

at the end of the day its about how much you can bear how much you can endure being together we harm nobody being apart we extinguish ourselves

of course he loves me i’m his sister

blood isn’t love said magnus and his voice was bitter

its one thing to fall in love its another to feel someone else fall in love with you and to feel a responsibility toward that love

i love you enough to never make you choose

its a strange universe he murmured

i love you i whispered

dont say that like youre saying goodbye

but i had to i the soul called wanderer love you human ian and that will never change no matter what i might become i worded it carefully so that there would be no lie in my voice

if i were a dolphin or a bear or a flower it wouldnt matter i would always love you always remember you you will be my only partner

you can live your whole life not realizing that what youre looking for is right in front of you

he loved her of course but better than that he chose her day after day choice that was the thing

i love her and thats the beginning and end of everything

love jo all your days if you choose but dont let it spoil you for its wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you cant have the one you want

the saddest thing about love joe is that not only the love cannot last forever but even the heartbreak is soon forgotten

who knows how to make love stay

tell love you are going to juniors deli on flatbush avenue in brooklyn to pick up a cheesecake and if loves stays it can have half it will stay

wake love up in the middle of the night tell it the world is on fire dash to the bedroom window and pee out of it casually return to bed and assure love that everything is going to be all right fall asleep love will be there in the morning

sometimes we love with nothing more than hope sometimes we cry with everything except tears

…there is the heat of love the pulsing rush of longing the lover’s whisper irresistible—magic to make the sanest man go mad

oh jake brett said we could have had such a damned good time together

ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic he raised his baton the car slowed suddenly pressing brett against me

yes i said isnt it pretty to think so

and yetto say the truth reason and love keep little company together nowadays

once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering

that which god said to the rose and caused it to laugh in fullblown beauty he said to my heart and made it a hundred times more beautiful

with you intimacy colours my voice

even ‘hello’ sounds like ‘come here

oh love isnt there to make us happy i believe it exists to show us how much we can endure

such short little lives our pets have to spend with us and they spend most of it waiting for us to come home each day

it is amazing how much love and laughter they bring into our lives and even how much closer we become with each other because of them

as your lover describes you so you are

so dont you worry your pretty little mind because people throw rocks at things that shine ours

living with him is like being told a perpetual story his mind is the biggest most imaginative i have ever met i could live in its growing countries forever

she smiled and her eyes started to drift downward

back up to his eyes

you know that im falling in love with you right

wait you think im going to die thats why you slept with me

how do you know when its over

maybe when you feel more in love with your memories than with the person standing in front of you

and yet i have had the weakness and have still the weakness to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me heap of ashes that i am into fire

but i have to confess im glad you two had at least a few months of happiness together

im not glad says peeta i wish we had waited until the whole thing was done officially

this takes even caesar aback surely even a brief time is better than no time

maybe id think that too caesar says peeta bitterly if it werent for the baby

the queens pride was his ship and he loved her that was the way his sentences always went it is raining today and i love you my cold is better and i love you say hello to horse and i love you like that

unless you love them and then they can burn it down

he was my north my south my east and west

my working week and my sunday rest

my noon my midnight my talk my song

i thought that love would last forever i was wrong

for it was not into my ear you whispered but into my heart it was not my lips you kissed but my soul

you may choose to look the other way but you can never say again that you did not know

i drive around the streets

an inch away from weeping

ashamed of my sentimentality and

to the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world

ultimately it is the desire not the desired that we love

you were you

and i was i

we were two

before our time

i was yours

before i knew

and you have always

been mine too

one should always be in love thats the reason one should never marry

we’d met at a carefree time a moment full of promise in its place now were the harsh lessons of the real world

i dont think we get a choice in who we fall for ian whispers i think we just do

so i placed my heart under lock and key

to take some time and take care of me

but i turn around and youre standing here

keep love in your heart a life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead the consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring

the court of dreams

if two people love each other there can be no happy end to it

neither love nor evil conquers all but evil cheats more

looking at him noweven if she hadnt been in love with him that part of her that was her mothers daugher that loved every beautiful thing for its beauty alone would still have wanted him

oh lizzy do anything rather than marry without affection

missing someone they say is selfcentered

i selfcenter you more than ever

the way you walk way you talk way you say my name its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change

i carry your heart with mei carry it in my heart

a heart filled with anger has no room for love

dont ever think i fell for you or fell over you i didnt fall in love i rose in it

first best is falling in love second best is being in love least best is falling out of love but any of it is better than never having been in love

if you could only love enough you could be the most powerful person in the world

i do my best thinking at night when everyone else is sleeping no interruptions no noise i like the feeling of being awake when no one else is

each time you happen to me all over again

did you think you could stop me ill burn the world down to save her

lovers and madmen have such seething brains

such shaping fantasies that apprehend

more than cool reason ever comprehends

the lunatic the lover and the poet

are of imagination all compact

one sees more devils than vast hell can hold

that is the madman the lover all as frantic

sees helens beauty in a brow of egypt

the poets eye in fine frenzy rolling

doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven

and as imagination bodies forth

the forms of things unknown the poets pen

turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing

a local habitation and a name

colpo di fulmine the thunderbolt as italians call it when love strikes someone like lightning so powerful and intense it can’t be denied it’s beautiful and messy

cracking a chest open and spilling their soul out for the world to see it turns a person inside out and there’s no going back from it once the thunderbolt hits your life is

and did you get what

you wanted from this life even so

i did

and what did you want

to call myself beloved to feel myself

beloved on the earth

then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place where his affection had rotted away and he could not find it

love is not a maybe thing you know when you love someone

the truest form of love is how you behave toward someone not how you feel about them

and i can fight only for something that i love love only what i respect and respect only what i at least know

your naked body should only belong to those who fall in love with your naked soul

vday…if you need this one day in a year to show everyone else you truly care for your loved one i think it’s quite stupid i hate this commercialism it’s all artificial and has nothing to do with real love

never never never i am never going to forget you

statistically speaking there is a  percent chance that the love of your life is having an affair be very suspicious

there are so many things that demand to be said where did you go do you ever think about me youve ruined me are you okay but of course i cant say any of that

i love you i say

i love you too he says ill see you soon

i love you more than i hate everything else

just because im not forever by your side doesnt mean thats not precisely where i want to be

when someone blushes doesnt that mean yes

any happiness no matter how brief seemed better than the long simmering torture of waking up day after day knowing i could never have him

last night i got up the courage to ask you if you regretted us

there are things i miss you said but if i didnt have you id miss more

i don’t think you ever really fall out of love with someone i think when you fall in love like true love it’s love for life all the rest is just experience and delusions

because this

this is everything

even on my weakest days

i get a little bit stronger

a man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her

to love is to suffer and there can be no love otherwise

most of us must learn to love people and use things rather than loving things and using people

you cannot be with someone just because you don’t want to hurt him you have your own happiness to think about

being with her i feel a pain like a frozen knife stuck in my chest an awful pain but the funny thing is im thankful for it its like that frozen pain and my very existence are one

the pain is an anchor mooring me here

failed relationships can be described as so much wasted makeup

to be brave is to love someone unconditionally without expecting anything in return to just give that takes courage because we dont want to fall on our faces or leave ourselves open to hurt

can officially confirm that the way to a mans heart these days is not through beauty food sex or alluringness of character but merely the ability to seem not very interested in him

she was right about something else too dimitri said after a long pause my back was to him but there was a strange quality to his voice that made me turn around

whats that i asked

that i do still love you

with that one sentence everything in the universe changed

the first time hed held her hand it felt so good that it crowded out all the bad things it felt better than anything had ever hurt

he was contemplation and enthusiasm ambition and strong coffee i could have looked at him forever

true beauty is something that attacks overpowers robs and finally destroys

life is a gift dont forget to live it

and you cant love not fully unless you are loved in return

i am the most miserable person who ever lived he said you are young and in love said primus every young man in your position is the most miserable young man who ever lived

blood of my blood he whispered and bone of my bone you carry me within ye claire and ye canna leave me now no matter what happens you are mine always if ye will it or no if ye want me or nay mine and i wilna let ye go

i seem to have loved you in numberless forms numberless times

in life after life in age after age forever

my spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs

that you take as a gift wear round your neck in your many forms

in life after life in age after age forever

whenever i hear old chronicles of love its age old pain

its ancient tale of being apart or together

as i stare on and on into the past in the end you emerge

clad in the light of a polestar piercing the darkness of time

you become an image of what is remembered forever

you and i have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount

at the heart of time love of one for another

we have played along side millions of lovers

shared in the same shy sweetness of meeting

the distressful tears of farewell

old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever

today it is heaped at your feet it has found its end in you

the love of all mans days both past and forever

the memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours

and the songs of every poet past and forever

it doesnt have to be on valentines day it doesnt have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirtythree or fiftynine it doesnt have to conform to whatever is usual it doesnt have to be kismet at once or rhapsody by the third date

it just has to be in time in place in spirit

it just has to be

the eye through which i see god is the same eye through which god sees me my eye and gods eye are one eye one seeing one knowing one love

if somebody says i love you to me i feel as though i had a pistol pointed at my head what can anybody reply under such conditions but that which the pistol holder requires i love you too

i dont like it when i outweigh my men

his breath hitched and he regarded me hungrily you’re playing with fire you know that

that’s weird considering you’re an ice prin— i didn’t get any further as ash leaned in and kissed me

that’s a woman’s love—it stands the test of time logic and all circumstance

well i’m here to tell you that expecting that kind of love— that perfection—from a man is unrealistic that’s right i said it—it’s not gonna happen no way no how because a man’s

love isn’t like a woman’s love

it is the possibility that keeps me going and though you may call me a dreamer or a fool or any other thing i believe that anything is possible

yes it wasnt over it still isnt over

i want you under me on your back

im sorry you deserve more respect than that but i cant stop thinking of it your arms and legs around me your mouth open for my kisses i need too much of you a lifetime of nights spent between your thighs wouldnt be enough

i want to talk with you forever i remember every word youve ever said to me

if only i could visit you as a foreigner goes into a new country learn the language of you wander past all borders into every private and secret place i would stay forever i would become a citizen of you

and there it stopped

when you love you wish to do things for you wish to sacrifice for you wish to serve

shes mad but shes magic theres no lie in her fire

would he find her

would he save her

a busy vibrant goaloriented woman is so much more attractive than a woman who waits around for a man to validate her existence

love is a striking example of how little reality means to us

i dont want sunbursts or marble halls i just want you

i want you to be weak as weak as i am

i feel like a part of my soul has loved you since the beginning of everything

maybe we’re from the same star

six hundred and forty fish later the only thing i know is everything you love will die the first time you meet someone special you can count on them one day being dead and in the ground

these pictures are my heart and if my heart was a canvas every square inch of it would be painted over with you

i go to sleep alone and wake up alone i take walks i work until im tired i watch the wind play with the trash thats been under the snow all winter everything seems simple until you think about it why is love intensified by abscence

and in the end we were all just humans drunk on the idea that love only love could heal our brokenness

often it is the most deserving people who cannot help loving those who destroy them

love is like a friendship caught on fire in the beginning a flame very pretty often hot and fierce but still only light and flickering as love grows older our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals deepburning and unquenchable

o serpent heart hid with a flowering face

did ever a dragon keep so fair a cave

beautiful tyrant feind angelical dove feather raven wolvishravening lamb despised substance of devinest show just opposite to what thou justly seemest  a dammed saint an honourable villain

surely it was a good way to die in the place of someone else someone i loved

a true gentleman is one that apologizes anyways even though he has not offended a lady intentionally he is in a class all of his own because he knows the value of a womans heart

there is no time for cutanddried monotony there is time for work and time for love that leaves no other time

when you loved someone and had to let them go there will always be that small part of yourself that whispers what was it that you wanted and why didnt you fight for it

love like fire goes out without fuel

ill find you there is no place in this world you can hide from me im watching

the fact is…i’m in love with you and i have been for some time

people die i think but your relationship with them doesnt it continues and is everchanging

like some wines our love could neither mature nor travel

annabeth pressed her lips to percy’s ear i love you

she wasn’t sure he could hear her—but if they died she wanted those to be her last words

he sighed and then focused his eyes right on me it was like drowning drowning in seas of green there was nothing in the world except for those eyes

i want to kiss you rose he said softly and i want you to want me too

i guess what im trying to say is that you are there in everything i am in everything ive ever done and looking back i know that i should have told you know much youve always meant to me

if having a soul means being able to feel love and loyalty and gratitude then animals are better off than a lot of humans

im the kind of boy that can fall in love with any girl because i love with the heart not the eyes

i threw myself into that fire threw myself into it into him and let myself burn

you had to know a person well to make them laugh like that

but maybe you never really had someone she thought now maybe no matter how much you loved them they could slip through your fingers like water and there was nothing you could do about it

if a man hasnt whats necessary to make a woman love him its his fault not hers

so much of the language of love was like that you devoured someone with your eyes you drank in the sight of him you swallowed him whole love was substance broken down and beating through your bloodstream

and yet another moral occurs to me now make love when you can its good for you

thats how you know you love someone i guess when you cant experience anything without wishing the other person were there to see it too

who could refrain

that had a heart to love and in that heart

courage to make love known

but how will i know who my soulmate is brida felt that this was one of the most important questions she had ever asked in her life

by taking risks’ she said to brida ‘ by risking failure disappointment disillusion but never ceasing in you search for love as long as you keep looking you will triumph in the end

i dont care if you say we cant be together i dont care if you think im the most evil unnatural creature walking on earth you can think whatever you want go whatever you want im going to just go on loving you even if its hopeless

youre a hero and a gentleman youre kind and honest but more than that youre the first man i ever truly loved and no matter what the future brings you always will be and i know that my life is better for it

when you feel someone elses pain and joy as powerfully as if it were your own then you know you really loved them

and when all the wars are over a butterfly will still be beautiful

before i wanted to say i found love but now i want to say i found a person and he belongs to me and i belong to him

love is the strongest force the world possesses and yet it is the humblest imaginable

you belong here you know that he says you belong with us itll be over soon so just hold on okay

he scratches behind his ear and looks away like hes embarrassed by what he said

i stare at him i feel my heartbeat everywhere even in my toes i feel like doing something bold but i could just as easily walk away i am not sure which option is smarter or better i am not sure that i care

i reach out and take his hand his fingers slide between mine i cant breathe

i stare up at him and he stares down at me for a long moment we stay that way then i pull my hand away and run after uriah and lynn and marlene maybe now he thinks im stupid or strange maybe it was worth it

marry me kiara he blurts out in front of everyone

why she asks challenging him

i want you any way i can get you not because you’re beautiful or clever or kind or adorable although devil knows you’re all those things i want you because there’s no one else like you and i don’t ever want to start a day without seeing you

there can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love

why is there ever this perverse cruelty in humankind that makes us hurt most those we love best

anyone lived in a pretty how town

with up so floating many bells down

he sang his didnt he danced his did

women and menboth little and small

cared for anyone not at all

they sowed their isnt they reaped their same

children guessedbut only a few

and down they forgot as up they grew

that noone loved him more by more

when by now and tree by leaf

she laughed his joy she cried his grief

bird by snow and stir by still

anyones any was all to her

someones married their everyones

laughed their cryings and did their dance

sleep wake hope and thenthey

said their nevers they slept their dream

and only the snow can begin to explain

how children are apt to forget to remember

with up so floating many bells down

and noone stooped to kiss his face

busy folk buried them side by side

little by little and was by was

all by all and deep by deep

and more by more they dream their sleep

noone and anyone earth by april

wish by spirit and if by yes

women and men both dong and ding

reaped their sowing and went their came

shes my kitten and no one elses

love like rain can nourish from above drenching couples with soaking joy but sometimes under the angry heat of life love dries on the surface and must nourish from below tending to its roots keeping itself alive

love when spelled backwards and read phonetically reads evil

the heart can think of no devotion

greater than being shore to the ocean

holding the curve of one position

counting an endless repetition

and i infinitesima­l being

drunk with the great starry

i felt myself a pure part

of the abyss

i wheeled with the stars

my heart broke loose on the wind

for women the best aphrodisiacs are words the gspot is in the ears he who looks for it below there is wasting his time

some feelings sink so deep into the heart that only loneliness can help you find them again some truths are so painful that only shame can help you live with them some things are so sad that only your soul can do the crying for them

thats when you know for sure somebody loves you they figure out what you need and they give it to you  without you asking

you can obsess and obsess over how things ended—what you did wrong or could have done differently—but theres not much of a point its not like itll change anything so really why worry

love consists of not looking each other in the eye but of looking outwardly in the same direction

now id rather be infected with love for the tiniest sliver of a second than live a hundred years smothered by a lie

you asked why i couldnt forgive you nick said very quietly and i jumped a little it was because you were the love of my life harper and you didnt want to be thats hard to let go

one more secret smile one more shared laugh one more electric kiss finding him was like finding someone i didnt know i was searching for

i desire to be with you i miss you i feel lonely when i cant see you i am obsessed with you fascinated by you infatuated with you i hunger for your taste your smell the feel of your soul touching mine

better to have loved and lost bullshit dont show me paradise and then burn it down

im not really sure why but do you stop loving someone just because they betray you i dont think so thats what makes the betrayal hurt so much  pain frustration anger and i still loved her i still do

hate looks like everybody else until it smiles

but youre the only one scarlet youll always be the only one

and he leans in so carefully breathing

and not breathing and hearts beating

between us and he’s so close he’s so close and i can’t feel my legs anymore i can’t feel my fingers or the cold or the emptiness of this room because all i feel is him everywherefilling everything and he whispers

he says please don’t shoot me for this

and he kisses me

his lips are softer than anything ive ever known soft like a first snowfall like biting into cotton candy like melting and floating and being weightless in water it’s sweet it’s

so effortlessly sweet

and then it changes

he kisses me again this time stronger

he’s breathing like he’s lost his mind andhe’s looking at me like something has brokeninside of him like he’s woken up to find that

his nightmares were just that that they never existed that it was all just a bad dream that felt far too real but now he’s awake and he’s safe and everything is going to be okay and

i’m falling

i’m falling apart and into his heart and i’m a disaster

the simple path

the fruit of service is peace

every normal man must be tempted at times to spit on his hands hoist the black flag and begin slitting throats

we ate well and cheaply and drank well and cheaply and slept well and warm together and loved each other

after all damn it what does being in love mean if you cant trust a person

never give all the heart for love

will hardly seem worth thinking of

to passionate women if it seem

certain and they never dream

that it fades out from kiss to kiss

for everything thats lovely is

but a brief dreamy kind delight

o never give the heart outright

for they for all smooth lips can say

have given their hearts up to the play

and who could play it well enough

if deaf and dumb and blind with love

he that made this knows all the cost

for he gave all his heart and lost

still if we want to avoid the suffering of leaving we will never experience the joy of loving and love is stronger than fear life stronger than death hope stronger than despair we have to trust that the risk of loving is always worth taking

the more loving one

looking up at the stars i know quite well

that for all they care i can go to hell

but on earth indifference is the least

we have to dread from man or beast

how should we like it were stars to burn

with a passion for us we could not return

if equal affection cannot be

let the more loving one be me

admirer as i think i am

of stars that do not give a damn

i cannot now i see them say

i missed one terribly all day

were all stars to disappear or die

i should learn to look at an empty sky

and feel its total dark sublime

though this might take me a little time

if you’re smart you care and if you care you love

when you find love you take it you grab it with both hands and you do everything in your power not to let it go you can’t just walk away from it and expect it to linger until you’re ready for it

she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humor at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men

dont go looking for boys in the dark

they will say pretty things then

leave you with scars

do go looking for boys in the park

for that is where the true gentlemen are

the minute i stopped trying to find the right girl and started trying to become the right guythe girl came

hope for love pray for love wish for love dream for love…but don’t put your life on hold waiting for love

only the united beat of sex and heart together can create ecstasy

if you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same then everything that happens in between can be dealt with

i was dead then alive

weeping then laughing

the power of love came into me

and i became fierce like a lion

then tender like the evening star

there is a desire within each of us

in the deep center of ourselves

that we call our heart

we were born with it

it is never completely satisfied

and it never dies

we are often unaware of it

but it is always awake

it is the human desire for love

every person in this earth yearns to love

to be loved to know love

our true identity our reason for being

is to be found in this desire

love is the why of life

why we are functioning at all

i am convinced

it is the fundamental energy

of the human spirit

the fuel on which we run

the wellspring of our vitality

and grace

which is the flowing

creative activity of love itself

is what makes all goodness possible

love should come first

it should be the beginning of

and the reason for everything

freely we serve

because we freely love as in our will

to love or not in this we stand or fall

the only way love can last a lifetime is if its unconditional the truth is this love is not determined by the one being loved but rather by the one choosing to love

you will never be able to escape from your heart so its better to listen to what it has to say

sex without love is a meaningless experience but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good

everybody is a main character to someone

love is always open arms if you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself

love is a promise love is a souvenir once given never forgotten never let it disappear

you made me feel alive again

it is a defect of gods humor that he directs our hearts everywhere but to those who have a right to them

love must not entreat she added or demand love must have the strength to become certain within itself then it ceases merely to be attracted and begins to attract

falling in love you remain a child rising in love you mature by and by love becomes not a relationship it becomes a state of your being not that you are in love  now you are love

the world is so empty if one thinks only of mountains rivers  cities but to know someone who thinks  feels with us  who though distant is close to us in spirit this makes the earth for us an inhabited garden

i would love to say

that you

weak in the knees

but

to be quite upfront

and completely

you

make my body

it has knees

at all

they send a person who can never stay she whispered who can never accept my offer of companionship for more than a little while they send me a hero i cant help  just the sort of person i cant help falling in love with

as i sailed into the lake i realized the fates really were cruel they sent calypso someone she couldnt help but love but it worked both ways for the rest of my life i would be thinking about her she would always be my biggest what if

dont worry about hurting me if thats what youre afraid of i want to get hurt at least i´ll feel something for a change

if you love someone you must be prepared to set them free

do you believe a man can truly love a woman and constantly betray hernever mind physically but betray her in his mindin the very poetry of his soulwellits not easy but men do it all the time

love is too precious to be ashamed of

how can something so wrong feel so right

you were the missing piece of my soul the breath in my lungs and the blood in my veins

you are the only one who has understood even a whisper of me and i will tell you that i am the only person who has understood even a whisper of you

being in love i find myself smiling for no reason at all

my mother poor fish

wanting to be happy beaten two or three times a

week telling me to be happy henry smile

why dont you ever smile

and then she would smile to show me how and it was the

unrequited love is the infinite curse of a lonely heart

love doesnt mean anything if youre not willing to make a commitment and you have to think not only about what you want but about what he wants not just now but in the future

only time can heal your broken heart just as only time can heal his broken arms and legs

this is part of what a family is about not just love its knowing that your family will be there watching out for you nothing else will give you that not money not fame not work

it is wrong to think that love comes from long companionship and persevering courtship love is the offspring of spiritual affinity and unless that affinity is created in a moment it will not be created for years or even generations

this i want to believe implicitly man was born for love and revolution

i have so much in me and the feeling for her absorbs it all i have so much and without her it all comes to nothing

if you love me as you say you do she whispered make it so that i am at peace

she laced her fingers through his good night she whispered with their hands clasped like children in a fairy tale she fell asleep beside him in the dark

i could never pretend something i didnt feel i could never make love if i didnt love and if i loved i could no more hide the fact than change the color of my eyes

all of sudden this shooting star went by and all i could think was that they were listening to us somehow

sometimes i feel like were a knot too tangled to be taken apart

sometimes people don’t understand

the promises they’re making when they make them i said

isaac shot me a look right of course

but you keep the promise anyway that’s

what love is love is keeping the promise anyway don’t you believe in true love

she had loved him for such a long time she thought how was it that she did now know him at all

what lips my lips have kissed and where and why

i have forgotten and what arms have lain

under my head till morning but the rain

is full of ghosts tonight that tap and sigh

upon the glass and listen for reply

and in my heart there stirs a quiet pain

for unremembered lads that not again

will turn to me at midnight with a cry

thus in the winter stands the lonely tree

nor knows what birds have vanished one by one

yet knows its boughs more silent than before

i cannot say what loves have come and gone

i only know that summer sang in me

a little while that in me sings no more

i knew i loved you before i met you

i think i dreamed you into life

i knew i loved you before i met you

i have been waiting all my life

why are you leaving me

he wrote i do not know how to live

i do not know either but i am trying

i do not know how to try

there were some things i wanted to tell him but i knew they would hurt him so i buried them and let them hurt me

the problem with marriage is that it ends every night after making love and it must be rebuilt every morning before breakfast

when i turn around he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that i dont know who is breathing for who but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey i dont know how long it lasts but when i let go of him i miss it already

we unaccustomed to courage

exiles from delight

until love leaves its high holy temple

and comes into our sight

to liberate us into life

and in its train come ecstasies

yet if we are bold

love strikes away the chains of fear

from our souls

we are weaned from our timidity

in the flush of loves light

we dare be brave

and suddenly we see

that love costs all we are

and will ever be

yet it is only love

which sets us free

the whole world is divided for me into two parts one is she and there is all happiness hope light the other is where she is not and there is dejection and darkness

you know someones right for you when the things they dont have to say are even more important than the things they do

hope is not about proving anything its about choosing to believe this one thing that love is bigger than any grim bleak shit anyone can throw at us

i have always found that actively loving

saves one from a morbid preoccupation

with the shortcomings of society

i’m stuck babysitting turtle eggs while a volleyball player slash grease monkey slash aquarium volunteer tries to hit on me

i’m not hitting on you he protested

no

believe me you’d know if i was hitting on you you wouldn’t be able to stop yourself from succumbing to my charms

he loved her for almost everything she was  she decided that was enough to let him stay for a very long time

you looove me holds out arms you love me this much

i’m here not because i am supposed to be here or because i’m trapped here but because i’d rather be with you than anywhere else in the world

i love the ground under his feet and the air over his head and everything he touches and every word he says i love all his looks and all his actions and him entirely and all together

he looked so lost so soulful so lonely i wanted him to kiss me now i wanted to let him know i was his for all eternity

every time i think im missing a piece of me you give it back

what i cannot love i overlook

i love you a thousand times over and i will never apologize for it

its a strange thing to discover and to believe that you are loved when you know that there is nothing in you for anybody but a parent or a god to love

make me into anything but just love me

if you love someone but rarely make yourself available to him or her that is not true love

love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in dreams

no matter where it is in the sky no matter where you are in the world the moon is never bigger than your thumb john

this time when we kiss i feel it in the pit of my stomach i feel it in my heart and i realize love isnt about sex its about connection

it is better to lose your pride with someone you love rather than to lose that someone you love with your useless pride

the way youre singing in your sleep

the way you look before you leap

the strange illusions that you keep

you dont know

but im noticing

the way your touch turns into arcs

the way you slide into the dark

the beating of my open heart

you dont know

but im noticing

then he was gone

just for that moment the thought that i might never see him again… it felt worse than death i wanted to

run after him tell him anything everything just don’t go please just never go please just always be near me so i can at least see you

i knew it in my bones that this time was it i had finally made my choice and so had he he let me go i was relieved which i expected what i didn’t expect was to feel so much grief

sometimes i get real lonely sleeping with you

if you cannot inspire a woman with love of you fill her above the brim with love of herself  all that runs over will be yours

love is not a habit a commitment or a debt it isnt what romantic songs tell us it is  love simply is

relationships are all about trust and equality if one person shares then the other person should share too

would you mind repeating that im afraid i might have lost my wits altogether and just hallucinated what ive longed to hear

i thought you were gone forever i thought you’d walked away from everything because i failed because i destroyed the only thing that ever mattered to me i waited for you to come but you didn’t

what do i care how e looks i am goodlooking enough for both of us i theenk all these scars show is zat my husband is brave

close your eyes and ill kiss you tomorrow ill miss you

things that matter are not easy feelings of happiness are easy happiness is not flirting is easy love is not saying you’re friends is easy being friends is not

a mighty pain to love it is

and t is a pain that pain to miss

but of all pains the greatest pain

it is to love but love in vain

let us always meet each other with smile for the smile is the beginning of love

when god knows youre ready for the responsibility of commitment hell reveal the right person under the right circumstances

theyve got no idea what happiness is they dont know that without this love there is no happiness or unhappiness for usthere is no life

one of the best times for figuring out who you are  what you really want out of life right after a breakup

the opposite of love is not hate hate is just love gone bad the actual opposite of love is apathy when you dont care a damn as to what happens to the other person

i realized how truly hard it was really to see someone you love change right before your eyes not only is it scary it throws your balance off as well

i am my heart’s undertaker daily i go and retrieve its tattered remains place them delicately into its little coffin and bury it in the depths of my memory only to have to do it all again tomorrow

i crave your mouth your voice your hair

silent and starving i prowl through the streets

bread does not nourish me dawn disrupts me all day

i hunt for the liquid measure of your steps

i will not wait to love as best as i can we thought we were young and that there would be time to love well sometime in the future this is a terrible way to think it is no way to live to wait to love

the moment our lips met i knew with pure and piercing certainty that i would have waited for him forever

we come to love not by finding a perfect person but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly

i choose to love you in silence…

for in silence i find no rejection

i choose to love you in loneliness…

for in loneliness no one owns you but me

i choose to adore you from a distance…

for distance will shield me from pain

i choose to kiss you in the wind…

for the wind is gentler than my lips

i choose to hold you in my dreams…

for in my dreams you have no end

one of the most frustrating words in the human language as far as i could tell was love

so much meaning attached to this one little word people bandied it about freely using it to

describe their attachments to possessions pets vacation destinations and favorite foods in the

same breath they then applied this word to the person they considered most important in their

lives wasn’t that insulting shouldn’t there be some other term to describe deeper emotion

oh lovers be careful in those dangerous first days once youve brought breakfast in bed youll have to bring it forever unless you want to be accused of lovelessness and betrayal

you can love a person dear to you with a human love but an enemy can only be loved with divine love

if love be rough with you be rough with love prick love for pricking and you beat love down

love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy to a friend

absence is to love what wind is to fire it extinguishes the small it inflames the great

tears are words the heart cant express

i think youre still the only person sharp enough to sharpen someone like me

you are the most important thing to me now the most important thing to me ever

i wish i had a boyfriend i wish he lived in the wardrobe on a coat hanger whenever i wanted i could get him out and hed look at me the way boys do in films as if im beautiful

a woman should soften but not weaken a man

loving someone is giving them the power to break your heart but trusting them not to

i prefer the color blue to any other the scent of lilacs in your hair is a source of constant torment i despise figs lastly i will never forget all the days of my life the memories of last night—

for nothing not the sun not the rain not even the brightest star in the darkest sky could begin to compare to the wonder of you

so long as we love we serve so long as we are loved by others i would almost say that we are indispensable and no man is useless while he has a friend

we stood there looking at each other saying nothing but it was the kind of nothing that meant everything in his eyes there was no trace of what had happened between us earlier and i could feel something inside me break

so that was that we were finally finally over

i looked at him and i felt so sad because this thought occurred to me i will never look at you the same way again ill never be that girl again the girl who comes running back every time you push her away the girl who loves you anyway

i couldn’t even be mad at him because this was who he was this was who he’d

always been he’d never lied about that he gave and then he took away i felt it in the pit of my stomach the familiar ache that lost regretful feeling only he could give me i never wanted to feel it again never ever

maybe this was why i came so i could really know so i could say goodbye

i looked at him and i thought if i was very brave or very honest i would tell him

i would say it so he would know it and i would know it and i could never take it back but i wasn’t that brave or honest so all i did was look at him and i think he knew anyway

i release you i evict you from my heart because if i dont do it now i never will

i was the one to look away first

see how she leans her cheek upon her hand

o that i were a glove upon that hand

that i might touch that cheek

but if you love and must needs have desires let these be your desires

to melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night

to know the pain of too much tenderness

to be wounded by your own understanding of love

and to bleed willingly and joyfully

to wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving

to rest at noon hour and meditate loves ecstasy

to return home at eventide with gratitude

and then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise on your lips

absence makes the heart grow fonder but it sure makes the rest of you lonely

love cannot be forced love cannot be coaxed and teased it comes out of heaven unasked and unsought

stronger than lovers love is lovers hate incurable in each the wounds they make

one step as if in a daze

she loosed a shuddering breath and a small whimpering noise came out of her  a sob

and then she was sprinting down the alley flying as though the winds themselves pushed at her heels

she flung herself on the male crashing into him hard enough that anyone else might have gone rocking back into the stone wall

but the male grabbed her to him his massive arms wrapping around her tightly and lifting her up nesryn made to approach but aedion stopped her with a hand on her arm

aelin was laughing as she cried and the male was just holding her his hooded head buried in her neck as if he were breathing her in

who is that nesryn asked

the more boys i meet the more i love my dog

i hug him tightly i can’t imagine my life without you christian i love you so much it frightens me me too he breathes my life would be empty without you i love you so much

in all the world there is no heart for me like yours

in all the world there is no love for you like mine

find your name

and buried treasure

face your life

its pain

its pleasure

leave no path untaken

the words ‘i love you’ kill and resurrect millions in less than a second

someone once wrote that a novel should deliver a series of small astonishments i get the same thing spending an hour with you

whatever happened to the dragon

i mustered my primmest tone he has a name you know

adrian pulled back and gave me a curious look i didnt know actually whatd you decide on

hopper when adrian laughed i added best rabbit ever hed be proud to know his name is being passed on

yes im sure he would did you name the mustang too

i think you mean the ivashkinator

he stared at me in wonder i told you i loved you right

yes i assured him many times

theres no need to wait for the bad things and bullshit to be over change now love now live now dont wait for people to give you permission to live because they wont

do you really think anyone in this world compares to you in my eyes

i mean its not surprising really once you love something you always love it in some way you have to its like part of you for good

its not reasonable to love people who are only going to die she said

nash thought about that for a moment stroking smalls neck with great deliberation as if the fate of the dells depended on that smooth careful movement

yes she whispered

he stroked smalls nose i love you he said even knowing youll never have me and i love my brother more than i ever realized before you came along you cant help whom you love lady nor can you know what its liable to cause you to do

wake up he murmured his deep voice cutting through the layers of the darkness don’t do this if you don’t come out of this soon you’ll fade away and drift forever fight it come back to us

please a hand gripped mine real and solid anchoring me to the present i know what you must think of me but… the voice broke off took a ragged breath don’t leave it whispered meghan don’t go come back to me

love god and he will enable you to love others even when they disappoint you

but beauty is about finding the right fit the most natural fit to be perfect you have to feel perfect about yourself  avoid trying to be something youre not for a goddess thats especially hard we can change so easily

love makes us such fools

he was the toast to her butter

plant seeds of happiness hope success and love it will all come back to you in abundance this is the law of nature

i dont remember who said this but there really are places in the heart you dont even know exist until you love a child

never forget that justice is what love looks like in public

truth without love is brutality and love without truth is hypocrisy

im not married he said softly because i cant stomach the idea of marrying a woman inferior to me in mind and spirit it would mean the death of my soul

that night when you kissed me i left a poem in your mouth and you can hear some of the lines every time you breathe out

looking at beauty in the world is the first step of purifying the mind

the only queer people are those who dont love anybody

those whom we most love are often the most alien to us

you have my whole heart you always did

if you arent the woman i think you are then this isnt the world i thought it was

i dont understand the point of being together if youre not the happiest

there are times when i doubt everything when i regret everything youve taken from me everything ive given you and the waste of all the time ive spent on us

love like rain can nourish from above drenching couples with a soaking joy but sometimes under the angry heat of life love dries on the surface and must nourish from below tending to its roots keeping itself alive

wanting him to come back before anyone notices part of the world has not moved since he left

why darling i dont live at all when im not with you

i think you can only be truly mad at someone you really love

before i fell

in love with words

with setting skies

and singing birds—

it was you i fell

in love with first

it ought to make us feel ashamed when we talk like we know what were talking about when we talk about love

im in love with you and im not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things

i love you not only for what you are but for what i am when i am with you

huh leo said well if you ever get off this island and want a job let me know youre not a total klutz

she smirked a job eh making things in your forge

nah we could start our own shop leo said surprising himself starting a machine shop had always been one of his dreams but hed never told anyone about it leo and calypsos garage auto repair and mechanical monsters

look at me chica when she does i repeat eres hermosa

what does it mean

youre beautiful

love is illogical love had consequencesi did this to myself and i should be able to take it

sometimes two people have to fall apart to realize how much they need to fall back together

i got my hearts desire and there my troubles began

my head’ll explode if i continue with this escapism

albert camus wrote that the only serious question is whether to kill yourself or not

tom robbins wrote that the only serious question is whether time has a beginning and an end

camus clearly got up on the wrong side of bed and robbins must have forgotten to set the alarm

there is only one serious question and that is who knows how to make love stay

answer me that and i will tell you whether or not to kill yourself

everyone always wants to know how you can tell when its true love and the answer is this when the pain doesnt fade and the scars dont heal and its too damned late

sweets to the sweet

stop all the clocks cut off the telephone

prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone

silence the pianos and with muffled drum

bring out the coffin let the mourners come

scribbling on the sky the message he is dead

put crêpe bows round the white necks of the public doves

let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves

he was my north my south my east and west

my working week and my sunday rest

my noon my midnight my talk my song

i thought that love would last for ever i was wrong

the stars are not wanted now put out every one

pack up the moon and dismantle the sun

pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood

for nothing now can ever come to any good

did you mean it that if victor did tellthat youd i couldnt finish i couldnt bring myself to say the words have him killed

i dont have much influence in the upper levels of moroi royalty but i have plenty among the guardians who handle the dirty work in our world

you didnt answer the question if youd really do it

id do a lot of things to protect you roza

can i say something

im a little drunk

me too thats okay

justi missed you you know

i missed you too

but so so much dexter there were so many things i wanted to talk to you about and you werent there

same here

i tell you what it is itswhen i didnt see you i thought about you every day i mean every day in some way or another

same here

you know what happens you have a family your responsibilities change you lose touch with people

it wont be like that i promise

do you

you swear no more disappearing

i wont if you wont

their lips touched now mouths pursed tight their eyes open both of them stock still the moment held a kind of glorious confusion

ah love let us be true

to one another for the world which seems

to lie before us like a land of dreams

so various so beautiful so new

hath really neither joy nor love nor light

nor certitude nor peace nor help for pain

and we are here as on a darkling plain

swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight

where ignorant armies clash by night

every life has one true love snapshot

those we love never truly leave us harry there are things that death cannot touch

i love you i said and stabbed him

two things you will never have to chase true friends  true love

two words three vowels four constenants seven letters it can either cut you open to the core and leave you in ungodly pain or it can free your soul and lift a tremendous weight off you shoulders the phrase is its over

the heart of man is very much like the sea it has its storms it has its tides and in its depths it has its pearls too

the universe is very very big

it also loves a paradox for example it has some extremely strict rules

not you or your family or your house or your planet or the sun it is an absolute rule therefore when someone says that their love will never die it means that their love is not real for everything that is real dies

i want someone who is fierce and will love me until death and knows that love is as strong as death and be on my side forever and ever i want someone who will destroy and be destroyed by me

love is made up of three unconditional properties in equal measure

remove any one of the three and the triangle falls apart

which by the way is something highly inadvisable think about it — do you really want to live in a world of only two dimensions

so for the love of a triangle please keep love whole

i imagine a line a white line painted on the sand and on the ocean from me to you

i love you because no two snowflakes are alike and it is possible if you stand tippytoe to walk between the raindrops

you deserve a lover who wants you disheveled with everything and all the reasons that wake you up in a haste and the demons that won’t let you sleep

you deserve a lover who makes you feel safe who can consume this world whole if he walks hand in hand with you someone who believes that his embraces are a perfect match with your skin

you deserve a lover who wants to dance with you who goes to paradise every time he looks into your eyes and never gets tired of studying your expressions

you deserve a lover who listens when you sing who supports you when you feel shame and respects your freedom who flies with you and isn’t afraid to fall

you deserve a lover who takes away the lies and brings you hope coffee and poetry

i should go i said thickly let me know when you want to start practice again and thanks fortalking

i started to turn then i heard him say abruptly no

i glanced back what

he held my gaze and something warm and wonderful and powerful shot between us

no he repeated i told her no

i i shut my mouth before my jaw hit the floor butwhy that was a onceinalifetime thing you could have had a baby and sheshe was you know into you

the ghost of a smile flickered on his face yes she was is and thats why i had to say no i couldnt return thatcouldnt give her what she wanted not when he took a few steps toward me not when my heart is somewhere else

know that love is truly timeless

you who suffer because you love love still more to die of love is to live by it

even when im dead ill swim through the earth

like a mermaid of the soil just to be next to your bones

jane my little darling so i will call you for so you are you dont know what you are talking about you misjudge me again it is not because she is mad i hate her if you were mad do you think i should hate you

i do indeed sir

she just smiled said that she loved books more than anything and started telling him excitedly what each of the ones in her lap was about and ove realised that he wanted to hear her talking about the things she loved for the rest of his life

people always say that when you love someone nothing in the world matters but thats not true is it you know and i know that when you love someone everything in the world matters a little bit more

i justi just miss him and i hate being so alone

they had an ordinary life full of ordinary thingsif love can ever be called that

and if you couldnt be loved the next best thing was to be let alone

where you go i shall go where you die i shall die and there will i be buried

the heart wants what it wants  or else it does not care

love who you love while you have them thats all you can do let them go when you must if you know how to love youll never run out

god turns you from one feeling to another and teaches by means of opposites so that you will have two wings to fly not one

i know which life is my real one now no matter what happens it’s the one with you for some reason knowing that even one person knows my story makes things different maybe it’s like the poem says maybe this is my way of not going gentle

i love you ky markham

loves gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted

if equal affection cannot be

let the more loving one be me

you get use to someone—start to like them even—and they leave in the end everyone leaves

conquer the angry one by not getting angry conquer the wicked by goodness conquer the stingy by generosity and the liar by speaking the truth

were you always such a stubborn blind obtuse girl

are you calling me stupid

yes but in a more poetic way

well here’s a poem for you get lost

every day people straighten up the hair why not the heart

hate is its too easy love love takes courage

if a writer falls in love with you you can never die

i crossed a thousand leagues to come to you and lost the best part of me along the way dont tell me to leave

jace looked as if she had slapped him why are you determined not to believe us

because she loves you said valentine

clary felt the blood drain out of her face

in itself homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man either a human being without feeling fear restraint or obligation

were all golden sunflowers inside

a weed is but an unloved flower

when you miss someoneit’s weird…your body doesn’t function normallyas it should because i miss you and my heart…it’s not steady…my soul it sings numb fingers are cold…like you…your soul

it was brave countered issa it was rare it was love and it was beautiful

for a long time she held a special place in my heart i kept this special place just for her like a reserved sign on a quiet corner table in a restaurant despite the fact that i was sure id never see her again

i… what are you saying zsadist she stammered even though shed heard every word

he glanced back down at the pencil in his hand and then turned to the table flipping the spiral notebook to a new page he bent way over and labored on top of the paper for quite a while then he ripped the sheet free

his hand was shaking as he held it out its messy

bella took the paper in a childs uneven block letters there were three words i love you

her lips flattened tight as her eyes stung the handwriting got wavy and then disappeared

maybe you cant read it he said in a small voice i can do it over

she shook her head i can read it just fine its… beautiful

i dont expect anything back i mean… i know that you dont… feel that for me anymore but i wanted you to know its important that you knew

five minutes are enough to dream a whole life that is how relative time is

had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly

and ill dance with you in vienna

ill be wearing a rivers disguise

the hyacinth wild on my shoulder

my mouth on the dew of your thighs

and ill bury my soul in a scrapbook

with the photographs there and the moss

and ill yield to the flood of your beauty

my cheap violin and my cross

i come here with no expectations only to profess now that i am at liberty to do so that my heart is and always will beyours

men are driven by two principal impulses either by love or by fear

do you remember all of your audiences marco asks

not all of them celia says but i remember the people who look at me the way you do

what way might that be

as though they cannot decide if they are afraid of me or they want to kiss me

i am not afraid of you marco says

cant you just like a girl who likes you back

none of them likes me back i may as well like the one i really want

sometimes i sit alone under the stars and think of the galaxies inside my heart and truly wonder if anyone will ever want to make sense of all that i am

we rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new but to feel nothing so as not to feel anything—what a waste

all the most powerful emotions come from chaos fearangerlove especially love love is chaos itself think about it love makes no sense it shakes you up and spins you around and then eventually  it falls apart

half the night i waste in sighs

half in dreams i sorrow after

the delight of early skies

in a wakeful dose i sorrow

for the hand the lips the eyes

for the meeting of the morrow

the delight of happy laughter

the delight of low replies

nobody ever gets what they want when it comes to love

wisdom is knowing i am nothing

love is knowing i am everything

and between the two my life moves

but the you who you are tonight is the same you i was in love with yesterday the same you i’ll be in love with tomorrow

one rarely falls in love without being as much attracted to what is interestingly wrong with someone as what is objectively healthy

i think everything that happened in idrisvalentine max hodge even sebastiani kept shoving it all down trying to forget but its catching up with me i ill get help ill get better i promise

you promise

i swear on the angel he ducked his head down kissed her cheek

the hell with that i swear on us

and life definitely doesnt want me

to just let it tell me

that the girl i met

the beautiful amazing strong resilient girl

that i fell so hard for

should only come in third

life is trying to tell ne

that the girl i love

the girl i fell

so hard for

theres room for her in first

im putting her first

not the kind you see in the movies or hear about on the radio

the real kind

the kind that gets beaten down and bloody yet perseveres

the kind that hopes even when hope seems foolish

the kind that can forgive the kind that believes in healing

the kind that can sit in silence and feel renewed

the real kind of love

its rare and we have it

don’t take the high ground and assume you already know what you’ll do the truth is when it comes to someone you love you’ll find there isn’t anything you won’t do

you might be looking for reasons but there are no reasons

i didnt know love could leave the lights on all the time

a friend of mine once defined love as finding someone you can talk to late into the night

your kids require you most of all to love them for who they are not to spend your whole time trying to correct them

but love i’ve come to understand is more than three words mumbled before bedtime love is sustained by action a pattern of devotion in the things we do for each other every day

cut the ending revise the script the man of her dreams is a girl

it’s strange how dreams get under your skin and give your heart a test for what’s real and what’s imaginary

love after love

the time will come

when with elation

you will greet yourself arriving

at your own door in your own mirror

and each will smile at the others welcome

and say sit here eat

you will love again the stranger who was your self

give wine give bread give back your heart

to itself to the stranger who has loved you

all your life whom you ignored

for another who knows you by heart

take down the love letters from the bookshelf

the photographs the desperate notes

peel your own image from the mirror

sit feast on your life

submission is not about authority and it is not obedience it is all about relationships of love and respect

im guilty of giving people more chances than they deserve but when im done im done

would you rather live one perfect day over and over or live your life with no perfect days but just decent ones

most men claim to desire driven independent and confident women yet when confronted with such a creature reverence often evolves into resent for just like women men need to be needed

love is like breathing you take it in and let it out

when it comes to men deal with them as they are not how you’d like them to be

after all my erstwhile dear

my no longer cherished

need we say it was not love

just because it perished

he placed his hands

on my mind

before reaching

for my waist

my hips

or my lips

he didnt call me

he called me

how he touches me

you can’t leave yet i’m not finished falling in love with you

its like im thirteen again and hes my crush all im aware of in this entire roomful of people is him where he is what hes doing who hes talking to

if we’re going to kiss it has to be bookworthy

how could i be sleeping with this particular man surely only true love could justify my lack of taste

i never want to be away from you again except at work in the restroom or when one of us is at a movie the other does not want to see

you cant hurt me the way you think you can but even if you could i would rather die with the taste of you on my tongue than live and never touch you again im in love with you mara i love you no matter what you do

he offered her the world she said she had her own

its so much easier to convince yourself youre madly in love with someone when you know nothing about him

nelly i am heathcliff  hes always always in my mind  not as a pleasure any more then i am always a pleasure to myself  but as my own being

so he called to her back just out of curiosity you know purely conversation and all at what age will you be entertaining offers of marriage

you think itll be so easy she called back over her shoulder no way there will be tasks like in a fairy tale

very so think twice

no need he said youre worth it

i can do pain that’s the easy part of life it’s everything else happiness laughter love that’s fucking complicated

i want someone whose heart is big enough to hold me

want to keep christ in christmas feed the hungry clothe the naked forgive the guilty welcome the unwanted care for the ill love your enemies and do unto others as you would have done unto you

i do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strange

when you like someone you like them in spite of their faults when you love someone you love them with their faults

heart we will forget him

you and i tonight

you must forget the warmth he gave

i will forget the light

you honestly expect me to breathe in a world without air

im backing down now i really do love you thats why im doing this

people wait around too long for love im happy with all of my lusts

whats a fuck when what i want is love

you don’t love because you love despite not for the virtues but despite the faults

it hurts to breathe it hurts to live i hate her yet i do not think i can exist without her

twice i have lived forever in a smile

i dont want to be somebodys crush if somebody likes me i want them to like the real me not what they think i am

love is thicker than forget

more thinner than recall

more seldom than a wave is wet

more frequent than to fail

it is most mad and moonly

and less it shall unbe

than all the sea which only

is deeper than the sea

love is less always than to win

less never than alive

less bigger than the least begin

less littler than forgive

it is most sane and sunly

and more it cannot die

than all the sky which only

is higher than the sky

i have done it she says at first i do not understand but then i see the tomb and the marks she has made on the stone a c h i l l e s it reads and beside it p a t r o c l u s

go she says he waits for you

in the darkness two shadows reaching through the hopeless heavy dusk their hands meet and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun

a kiss on the beach when there is a full moon is the closest thing to heaven

what are you doing

kneeling before a goddess

i’m not a goddess

you are a goddess a princess a queen as a soldier i pledge myself to your service as a prince i grant you any boon within my power as a man i ask to sit at your feet and worship you ask me to do anything for you and i will do it

there are so many men all endlessly attempting to sweep me off my feet and there is one of you trying just the opposite making sure my feet are firm beneath me lest i fall

we are not people who touch each other carelessly every point of contact between us feels important a rush of energy and relief

you remember your first love because they show you prove to you that you can love and be loved that nothing in this world is deserved except for love that love is both how you become a person and why

i have named you queen

there are taller than you taller

there are purer than you purer

there are lovelier than you lovelier

but you are the queen

when you go through the streets

no one recognizes you

no one sees your crystal crown no one looks

at the carpet of red gold

that you tread as you pass

the nonexistent carpet

and when you appear

all the rivers sound

in my body bells

shake the sky

and a hymn fills the world

only you and i

only you and i my love

listen to it

you say you’re sure sure that you’re in love how can you know it you think love is so simple

i have loved you all my life mal i whispered through my tears there is no end to our story

a girl can still admire can’t she even those who can’t afford to go in the store can still windowshop right knowing he wasn’t for me didn’t mean i couldn’t covet the merchandise

im sorry i know you loved her it was hard not to

what if love wasnt the act of finding what you were missing but the giveandtake that made you both match

love is a possible strength in an actual weakness

this time i wouldnt forget him because i couldnt ever forgive him  for breaking my heart twice

it was the nicest thing she could imagine it made her want to have his babies and give him both of her kidneys

i dont think you can define love

its hard to love a woman and do anything

let me love you but dont love me back do love me and let me hate you for a while let me feel like i have some control because i know i never do

physics isnt the most important thing love is

i love you so much that nothing can matter to me  not even youonly my love not your answer not even your indifference

deep in her heart she wasnt sure she deserved to be happy nor did she believe that she was worthy of someone who seemednormal

love which quickly arrests the gentle heart

seized him with my beautiful form

that was taken from me in a manner which still grieves me

love which pardons no beloved from loving

took me so strongly with delight in him

that as you see it still abandons me not

thought i couldnt live without you

its gonna hurt when it heals too

even though i really love you

im gonna smile cause i deserve to

quickly im learning to love again

all i know is imma be ok

i love you in my mind where my thoughts reside in my heart where my emotions live and in my soul where my dreams are born i love you

dont let yourself die without knowing the wonder of fucking with love

there’s something about arriving in new cities wandering empty streets with no destination i will never lose the love for the arriving but im born to leave

knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving when we can be alone we can be with others without using them as a means of escape

the truth was he now belonged only to my past and it was time i begin to accept it as much as it hurt to do so

the right thing at the wrong tme is the wrong thing

you are protected in short by your ability to love

well my music was different in high school i was singing about love—you know things i dont care about anymore

love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame

if you have the woman you love what more do you need well besides an alibi for the time of her husband’s murder

you know that when i hate you it is because i love you to a point of passion that unhinges my soul

my girlfriend is sad and quiet and keeps me up all night worrying about her

youre like a grey sky youre beautiful even though you dont want to be

he showed me his scars and in return he let me pretend that i had none

love is honesty love is a mutual respect for one another

so this is for us

this is for us who sing write dance act study run and love

and this is for doing it even if no one will ever know

because the beauty is in the act of doing it

not what it can lead to

this is for the times i lose myself while writing singing playing

and no one is around and they will never know

but i will forever remember

and that shines brighter than any praise or fame or glory i will ever have

and this is for you who write or play or read or sing

by yourself with the light off and door closed

when the world is asleep and the stars are aligned

and maybe no one will ever hear it

or read your words

or know your thoughts

but it doesn’t make it less glorious

it makes it ethereal mysterious

for it belongs to you and whatever god or spirit you believe in

and only you can decide how much it meant

and means

and will forever mean

and other people will experience it too

through you

through your spirit through the way you talk

through the way you walk and love and laugh and care

and i never meant to write this long

but what i want to say is

and let your very existence be your song your poem your story

let your very identity be your book

let the way people say your name sound like the sweetest melody

so go create take photographs in the wood run alone in the rain and sing your heart out high up on a mountain

where no one will ever hear

and your very existence will be the most hypnotising scar

make your life be your art

and you will never be forgotten

because i’ve got a lot more terms of endearment to use honey pie sugarplum bread pudding

he drew a circle that shut me out

heretic rebel a thing to flout

but love and i had the wit to win

must i love a manwho doesnt love me

must i be born with so little art

as to love a man wholl break my heart

the whole image is that eternal suffering awaits anyone who questions gods infinite love thats the message were brought up with isnt it believe or die thank you forgiving lord for all those options

i think you can love a person too much

so i’m your huntress and thief his hands slid down to cup the backs of my knees as he said with a roguish grin you are my salvation feyre

love cannot live where there is no trust

you can never be wise and be in love at the same time

the old astronomer to his pupil

reach me down my tycho brahe i would know him when we meet

when i share my later science sitting humbly at his feet

he may know the law of all things yet be ignorant of how

we are working to completion working on from then to now

pray remember that i leave you all my theory complete

lacking only certain data for your adding as is meet

and remember men will scorn it tis original and true

and the obloquy of newness may fall bitterly on you

but my pupil as my pupil you have learned the worth of scorn

you have laughed with me at pity we have joyed to be forlorn

what for us are all distractions of mens fellowship and smiles

what for us the goddess pleasure with her meretricious smiles

you may tell that german college that their honor comes too late

but they must not waste repentance on the grizzly savants fate

though my soul may set in darkness it will rise in perfect light

i have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night

what my boy you are not weeping you should save your eyes for sight

you will need them mine observer yet for many another night

i leave none but you my pupil unto whom my plans are known

you have none but me you murmur and i leave you quite alone

well then kiss me  since my mother left her blessing on my brow

there has been a something wanting in my nature until now

i can dimly comprehend it  that i might have been more kind

might have cherished you more wisely as the one i leave behind

i have never failed in kindness no we lived too high for strife

calmest coldness was the error which has crept into our life

but your spirit is untainted i can dedicate you still

to the service of our science you will further it you will

there are certain calculations i should like to make with you

to be sure that your deductions will be logical and true

and remember patience patience is the watchword of a sage

not today nor yet tomorrow can complete a perfect age

i have sown like tycho brahe that a greater man may reap

but if none should do my reaping twill disturb me in my sleep

so be careful and be faithful though like me you leave no name

see my boy that nothing turn you to the mere pursuit of fame

i must say goodbye my pupil for i cannot longer speak

draw the curtain back for venus ere my vision grows too weak

it is strange the pearly planet should look red as fiery mars

god will mercifully guide me on my way amongst the stars

it shattered something inside me that hadnt been broken before

it takes great courage to see the world in all its tainted glory and still to love it and even more courage to see it in the one you love

happiness you see its just an illusion of fate a heavenly sleight of hand designed to make you believe in fairy tales but theres no happily ever after youll only find happy endings in books some books

love those you hate you

there is one friend in the life of each of us who seems not a separate person however dear and beloved but an expansion an interpretation of ones self the very meaning of ones soul

neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius love love love that is the soul of genius

she held up her calloused grimy fingers leo couldnt help thinking there was nothing hotter than a girl who didnt mind getting her hands dirty but of course that was just a general comment didnt apply to calypso obviously

you are not weak you are not indecisive you are strong fierce capable beyond measure

i haven’t been very impressed lately

by people

or places

or the way someone said he loved me and then slowly changed his mind

if love is like a possession maybe my letter are like my exorcisms

a man in love can do extraordinary things i don’t care if you’re an angel you’re my angel and i won’t let you go

a truth should exist

it should not be used

like this if i love you

is that a fact or a weapon

i told him a story of two people two people who shouldnt have met and who didnt like each other much when they did but who found they were the only two people in the world who could possibly have understood each other

men build too many walls and not enough bridges

don’t worry if people think you’re crazy you are crazy you have that kind of intoxicating insanity that lets other people dream outside of the lines and become who they’re destined to be

i am your moon and your moonlight too

i am your flower garden and your water too

i have come all this way eager for you

without shoes or shawl

i want you to laugh

to kill all your worries

to love you

to nourish you

gratitude looks to the past and love to the present fear avarice lust and ambition look ahead

he experienced the singular pleasure of watching people he loved fall in love with other people he loved

i believe in the immeasurable power of love that true love can endure any circumstance and reach across any distance

id like to get away from earth awhile

and then come back to it and begin over

may no fate wilfully misunderstand me

and half grant what i wish and snatch me away

not to return earths the right place for love

i dont know where its likely to go better

i would lay down everything i possess even my soul for you if that isnt love its the best i have

love demands everything they say but my love demands only this that no matter what happens or how long it takes youll keep faith in me youll remember who we are and youll never feel despair

may i kiss you then on this miserable paper i might as well open the window and kiss the night air

pleasetame me he said

i want to very much the little prince replied but i have not much time i have friends to discover and a great many things to understand

what must i do to tame you asked the little prince

and im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

who knows maybe they’re right maybe we are driven crazy by our feelings maybe love is a disease and we would be better off without it

but we have chosen a different road and in the end that is the point of escaping the cure we are free to choose

we are even free to choose the wrong thing

you are afraid of it because it is stronger than you you hate it because you are afraid of it you love it because you cannot subdue it to your will only the unsubduable can be loved

we separate

when someone beats a rug

the blows are not against the rug

but against the dust in it

millions of people are suffering they want to be loved but they dont know how to love and love cannot exist as a monologue it is a dialogue a very harmonious dialogue

perfect love is the most beautiful of all frustrations because it is more than one can express

ill be your family now he says

i love you i say

he stares at me i wait with my hands clutching his arms for stability as he considers his response

he frowns at me say it again

tobias i say i love you

you have to take a deep breath and allow the music to flow through you revel in it allow yourself to awe when you play allow the music to break your heart with its beauty

love is forgiving accepting moving on embracing and all encompassing and if you’re not doing that for yourself you cannot do that with anyone else

i delete the picture of him from my phone i delete his number i think that if i just delete him enough it will be like none of it ever happened and my heart wont hurt so badly

when you arise in the morning think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive—to breathe to think to enjoy to love—then make that day count

if love is blind then maybe a blind person that loves has a greater understanding of it

i wanted to be his life preserver the thing that would keep him afloat instead he became my anchor and i’m tired of drowning

sometimes no matter how many eyelashes or dandelion seeds you blow no matter how much of your heart you tear out and slap on your sleeve it just aint gonna happen

she was the kind of girlfriend god gives you young so youll know loss the rest of your life

i just looked at her feeling utterly empty i didn’t know what i was supposed to say to her my life is in that bed please let me stay

but why why why cant people just say what they mean

when you fish for love bait with your heart not your brain

love me like youll never see me again

if it werent for music i would think that love is mortal

he was too perfect despite being one of the most imperfect people i knew

i want you to know

you know how this is

if i look

at the crystal moon at the red branch

of the slow autumn at my window

if i touch

near the fire

the impalpable ash

or the wrinkled body of the log

everything carries me to you

as if everything that exists

were little boats

that sail

toward those isles of yours that wait for me

well now

if little by little you stop loving me

i shall stop loving you little by little

if suddenly

you forget me

do not look for me

for i shall already have forgotten you

if you think it long and mad

the wind of banners

that passes through my life

and you decide

to leave me at the shore

of the heart where i have roots

that on that day

at that hour

i shall lift my arms

and my roots will set off

to seek another land

but

if each day

each hour

you feel that you are destined for me

with implacable sweetness

if each day a flower

climbs up to your lips to seek me

ah my love ah my own

in me all that fire is repeated

in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten

my love feeds on your love beloved

and as long as you live it will be in your arms

love whether newly born or aroused from a deathlike slumber must always create sunshine filling the heart so full of radiance that it overflows upon the outward world

is it really so that the one i love is everywhere

depression is the flaw in love to be creatures who love we must be creatures who can despair at what we lose and depression is the mechanism of that despair

life is short from here to that old car you know so well there is a stretch of twenty twentyfive paces it is a very short walk make those twentyfive steps now right now come just as you are and we shall live happily ever after

hes around the twist said azalea breaking all the windows hes mad

ah no said the king its only madness if you actually do it if you want to break all the windows in the house and drown yourself in a bucket but dont actually do it well thats love

you have made a place in my heart where i thought there was no room for anything else you have made flowers grow where i cultivated dust and stones remember this on this journey you insist on making if you die i will not survive you long

the fire of brigans heart was astounding fire understood and almost could not believe that the feeling he was sending her was love

i want you to be the one wanting me first pushing me first kissing me first dont be careful with me he said because i wont be careful with you

we shouldnt teach great books we should teach a love of reading knowing the contents of a few works of literature is a trivial achievement being inclined to go on reading is a great achievement

dont be reckless with other peoples hearts dont put up with people who are reckless with yours

to wish was to hope and to hope was to expect

love takes off the masks we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within

and the story of love is a long sad tale ending in graves

this thing about you that you think is your flaw  its the reason im falling in love with you

sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together

she didnt need to understand the meaning of life it was enough to find someone who did and then fall asleep in his arms and sleep as a child sleeps knowing that someone stronger than you is protecting you from all evil and all danger

whoever loves becomes humble those who love have  so to speak  pawned a part of their narcissism

we are asleep until we fall in love

when you were in love you were capable of learning everything and of knowing things you had never dared even to think because love was the key to understanding all of the mysteries

what is love two souls and one flesh friendship two bodies and one soul

nothing else wounds so deeply and irreparably nothing else robs us of hope so much as being unloved by one we love

if youre not comfortable enough with yourself or with your own truth when entering a relationship then youre not ready for that relationship

love is the most powerful force in the world that love can do anything

cant you see every step i have taken since i was that child on the bridge has been to bring myself closer to you

ever since time began people have recognized their true love by the light in their eyes

it is also not being able to remove the smile from your face loving life with a mad passionate intensity and feeling ten years younger

where is aelin

where is my wife

he was afraid of defiling the love which filled his soul

people do the damndest things when they’re in love

love is a combination of care commitment knowledge responsibility respect and trust

i believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear

maybe its only fitting that relationship that started with a lie would end with one

a slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech then ron said one person cant feel all that at once theyd explode

i am not a believer in love at first sight for love in its truest form is not the thing

of starryeyed or starcrossed lovers it is far more organic requiring nurturing and time

to fully bloom and as such seen best not in its callow youth but in its wrinkled maturity

like all living things love too struggles against hardship and in the process sheds

its fatuous skin to expose one composed of more than just a storm of emotion–one of loyalty

and divine friendship agape and though it may be temporarily blinded by adversity

it never gives in or up holding tight to lofty ideals that transcend this earth and

time–while its counterfeit simply concludes it was mistaken and quickly runs off to

find the next real thing

i do not know what it is about you that closes

and opensonly something in me understands

the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses

you can give without loving but you cannot love without giving

i am troubled immeasurably

by your eyes

i am struck by the feather

of your soft reply

the sound of glass

and conceals

what your eyes fight

to explain

making love to me is amazing wait i meant making love to me is amazing the absence of two little commas nearly transformed me into a sex god

how could you go about choosing something that would hold the half of your heart you had to bury

the first stab of love is like a sunset a blaze of color  oranges pearly pinks vibrant purples

define yourself radically as one beloved by god this is the true self every other identity is illusion

love is hard to find hard to keep and hard to forget

my shoulder will never be the same i expect you to nurse me back to health

so many days oh so many days

seeing you so tangible and so close

how do i pay with what do i pay

the bloodthirsty spring

has awakened in the woods

the foxes start from their earths

the serpents drink the dew

and i go with you in the leaves

between the pines and the silence

asking myself how and when

i will have to pay for my luck

of everything i have seen

its you i want to go on seeing

of everything ive touched

its your flesh i want to go on touching

i love your orange laughter

i am moved by the sight of you sleeping

what am i to do love loved one

i dont know how others love

or how people loved in the past

i live watching you loving you

being in love is my nature

you please me more each afternoon

where is she i keep on asking

if your eyes disappear

how long shes taking i think and im hurt

i feel poor foolish and sad

and you arrive and you are lightning

glancing off the peach trees

thats why i love you and yet not why

there are so many reasons and yet so few

for love has to be so

involving and general

particular and terrifying

joyful and grieving

flowering like the stars

and measureless as a kiss

thats why i love you and yet not why

there are so many reasons and yet so few

for love has to be so

involving and general

particular and terrifying

joyful and grieving

flowering like the stars

and measureless as a kiss

when you give yourself permission to communicate what matters to you in every situation you will have peace despite rejection or disapproval putting a voice to your soul helps you to let go of the negative energy of fear and regret

be worthy love and love will come

he is ugly and sad but he is all love

thus with my lips have i denounced you while my heart bleeding within me called you tender names

it was love lashed by its own self that spoke it was pride half slain that fluttered in the dust it was my hunger for your love that raged from the housetop while my own love kneeling in silence prayed your forgiveness

i was trying to make you jealous simon screamed right back his hands were fisted at his sides youre so stupid clary youre so stupid cant you see anything

she stared at him in bewilderment what on earth did he mean trying to make me jealous why would you try to do that

she saw immediately that this was the worst thing she could have asked him

because he said so bitterly that it shocked her ive been in love with you for ten years so i thought it seemed like the time to find out whether you felt the same about me which i guess you dont

better than chocolate being with you last night silly me i thought that nothing was better than chocolate

i know what it is to live entirely for and with what i love best on earth i hold myself supremely blest  blest beyond what language can express because i am my husbands life as fully as he is mine

like the fact that the person sirius cared for the most about in the world was you said dumbledore quietly

love is a state in which a man sees things most decidedly as they are not

if i had a camera i said id take a picture of you every day that way id remember how you looked every single day of your life

loveno such thing

whatever it is that binds families and married couples together thats not love thats stupidity or selfishness or fear love doesnt exist

self interest exists attachment based on personal gain exists complacency exists but not love love has to be reinvented that’s certain

may you live as long as you wish and love as long as you live

sometimes i wonder if my heart is like a black holeits so dense that theres no room for light but that doesnt mean it cant still suck me in

it reminds me that no embrace will ever feel the same again because no one will ever be like her again because shes gone shes gone and crying feels so useless so stupid but its all i can do

popular culture is a place where pity is called compassion flattery is called love propaganda is called knowledge tension is called peace gossip is called news and autotune is called singing

the end of a relationship is not always a failure sometimes all the love in the world is not enough to save something in these cases it is not a matter of fault from either person some things cannot be its as simple as that

nice costume he said

ditto i can tell you put a lot of thought into yours

amusement curled his mouth if you dont like it i can take it off

i felt silly for even mentioning it but once i did i knew i had to explain

for a moment you were quiet and then you nestled in and whispered

and i knew you understood

it was the moment i realized what music can do to people how it can make you hurt and feel so good all at once

love is so unpredictable thats what makes it so great

love the trees until their leaves fall off then encourage them to try again next year

in love one and one are one

this love of which i speak is slow to lose patience  it looks for a way of being constructive

love is not possessive

love is not anxious to impress nor does it cherish inflated ideas of its own ideas

love has good manners and does not pursue selfish advantage

love is not touchy

love does not keep account of evil or gloat over the wickedness of other people on the contrary it is glad with all good men when truth prevails

love knows no limits to its endurance no end to its trust no fading of its hope it can outlast anything it is in fact the one thing that stands when all else has fallen

do you like me

no answer

silence bounced fell off his tongue

and sat between us

and clogged my throat

it slaughtered my trust

it tore cigarettes out of my mouth

we exchanged blind words

and i did not cry

i did not beg

but blackness filled my ears

blackness lunged in my heart

and something that had been good

turned into a gas oven

no matter what nobody can take away the dances youve already had

remember how it was when we kissed armfuls and armfuls of light thrown right at us a rope dropping down from the sky how can the word love and the word life even fit in the mouth

my point is that love is the most powerful motivator in the world it spurs mortals to greatness their noblest bravest acts are done for love

why is the measure of love loss

despite the mayhem that followed bruno found that he was still holding shmuels hand in his own and nothing in the world would have persuaded him to let go

your absence has not taught me to be alone it merely has shown that when together we cast a single shadow on the wall

no man is offended by another mans admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment

waiting for you is like waiting for rain in this drought useless and disappointing  sam hilary duff a cinderella story

i am two fools i know

for loving and for saying so

she loved him but he didn’t know how to love

he could talk about love he could see love and feel love but he couldn’t give love

he could make love but he couldn’t make promises

she had desperately wanted his promises

she wanted his heart knew she couldn’t have it so she took what she could get

temporary bliss passionate highs and lows withdrawal and manipulation

he only stayed long enough to take what he needed and keep moving

if he stopped moving he would selfdestruct

if he stopped wandering he would have to face himself

he chose to stay in the dark where he couldn’t see

if he exposed himself and the sun came out he’d see his shadow

he was deathly afraid of his shadow

she saw his shadow loved it understood it saw potential in it

she thought her love would change him

he pushed and he pulled tested boundaries thinking she would never leave

he knew he was hurting her but didn’t know how to share anything but pain

he was only comfortable in chaos claiming souls before they could claim him

her love her body she had given to him and he’d taken with such feigned sincerity absorbing every drop of her

his dark heart concealed

she’d let him enter her spirit and stroke her soul where everything is love and sensation and surrender

wide open exposed to deception

it had never occurred to her that this desire was not love

it was blinding the way she wanted him

she couldn’t see what was really happening only what she wanted to happen

she suspected that he would always seek to minimize the risk of being split open his secrets revealed

he valued his soul’s privacy far more than he valued the intimacy of sincere connection so he kept his distance at any and all costs

intimacy would lead to his undoing—in his mind an irrational and indulgent mistake

when she discovered his indiscretions she threw love in his face and beat him with it

somewhere deep down in her labyrinth her intricacy the darkest part of her soul she relished the mayhem

she felt a sense of privilege for having such passion in her life

he stirred her core

the place she dared not enter

the place she could not stir for herself

but something wasn’t right

his eyes were cold and dark

his energy unaffected

he laughed at her and her antics told her she was a mess

frantic she looked for love hiding in his eyes in his face in his stance and she found nothing but disdain

and her heart stopped

who said

i cant wear my converse

with my dress well baby

thats just me

if you press me to say why i loved him i can say no more than because he was he and i was i

friendship is selfless love care respect and honor not a profitable opportunity

i never understood why anyone would have sex on the floor until i was with you and i realized you dont ever realize youre on the floor

zen masters say you cannot see your reflection in running water only in still water

he smiles at me and i am suddenly seventeen again  the year i realize that love doesnt follow the rules the year i understood that nothing is worth having so much as something unattainable

you are my butterfly and refuse to set you free

my love is pizza shaped won’t you have a slice it’s circular so there’s enough to go around

dance smile giggle marvel trust hope love wish believe most of all enjoy every moment of the journey and appreciate where you are at this moment instead of always focusing on how far you have to go

i wore your promise on my finger for one year

ill wear your name on my heart til i die

because you were my boy you were my only boy forever

for she had eyes and chose me

love is the sum of our choices the strength of our commitments the ties that bind us together

i love the lord for he heard my voice he heard my cry for mercy because he turned his ear to me i will call on him as long as i live psalms  niv

tell me then does love make one a fool or do only fools fall in love

do people look the same when they go to heaven mommy

i dont know i dont think so

then how do people recognize each other

i dont know sweetie they just feel it you dont need your eyes to love right

i love you not only for what you are but for what i am when i am with you i love you not only for what you have made of yourself but for what you are making of me i love you for the part of me that you bring out

none of us can choose where we shall love

remembering forgetting im not sure which is worse

they said that love was terrifying and tender wild and sweet and none of it made any sense

but now i knew that every mad word was true

right now we are here and nothing can mar our perfection or steal the joy of this perfect moment

lovings pretty easy its letting someone love you thats hard

she imagines him imagining her this is her salvation

he promised her that he would give her everything everything she wanted as men in love always do and she trusted him despite herself as women in love always do

but everyone disappears no matter who loves them

id rather die on my own terms than live on theirs id rather die loving alex than live without him

his noise is getting quieter but i can still see it there still

oh god he says looking away suddenly viola im sorry i didnt mean

but i just put my hand to the back of his neck

and he says viola

and i pull myself towards him

and i kiss him

and it feels like finally

i want to be the best version of myself for anyone who is going to someday walk into my life and need someone to love them beyond reason

you didn’t think i’d let you go alone did you

no but i’m grateful that i had you with me

grateful is all i’m going to get isn’t it

what else were you hoping for

adoration devotion affection infatuation or just plain finding me irresistible

sorry don juan you’ll have to live with my undying gratitude

you will be the first test subject tobias beatrice however she smiles you are too injured to be of much use to me so your execution will occur at the conclusion of this meeting

i try to hide the shudder that goes through me at the word execution my shoulder screaming with pain and look up at tobias its hard to blink tears back when i see the terror in tobiass wide dark eyes

no says tobias his voice trembles but his look stern as he shakes his head i would rather die

im afraid you dont have much of a choice in that matter replies jeanine lightly

everyone has choices to make no one has the right to take those choices away from us not even out of love

my father gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person he believed in me

that kind of love shouldve been able to beat sickness that kind of love shouldve conquered anything

it matters not who you love where you love why you love when you love or how you love it matters only that you love

the most confused you will ever get is when you try to convince your heart and spirit of something your mind knows is a lie

for there is no friend like a sister

in calm or stormy weather

to cheer one on the tedious way

to fetch one if one goes astray

to lift one if one totters down

fight for the only thing she knew was good enough noble enough powerful enough to be worth risking everything love

true friends are those who came into your life saw the most negative part of you but are not ready to leave you no matter how contagious you are to them

hearts live by being wounded

he felt now that he was not simply close to her but that he did not know where he ended and she began

the more you are motivated by love

the more fearless  free your action will be

turning your back on

if you love it

the language of love letters is the same as suicide notes

eternity is in love with the productions of time

love is illogical you fall into it like a manhole then youre just stuck you die in love more than you live in love

when forever becomes a placewhen forever ceases to be just a word… when it ceases to be just a measurement of time…but instead becomes a place where soul mates can dance to the song in their hearts that is a reflection of true love

you know that i could as soon forget you as my existence

almost all the time you tell yourself youre loving somebody when youre just using them

this only looks like love

everything i know i know because of love

love as thou wilt

the fiercest anger of all the most incurable

is that which rages in the place of dearest love

well its simple to love someone she said but its hard to know when you need to say it out loud

and then i opened my eyes and it was just grace and me  nothing anywhere but grace and me  she pressing her lips together as though she were keeping my kiss inside her and me holding this moment that was as fragile as a bird in my hands

the worst thing to give yourself away in exchange for not enough love

it was as if when i looked into his eyes i was standing alone on the edge of the worldon a windswept ocean beach there was nothing but the soft roar of the waves

my mother did not choose a leaf or a head she chose my father and to hold on to a certain feeling she sacrificed the world

i havent had that one great love which is good i dont want that to be in the past i want it to be in the future

i knew you would do me good in some way at some time i saw it in your eyes when i first beheld you their expression and smile did not again he stopped did not he proceeded hastily strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing

some girls are full of heartache and poetry and those are the kind of girls who try to save wolves instead of running away from them

no reason i like my ladies with a pulse

ive been saying it so long to you you just wouldnt listen every time you said farm boy do this you thought i was answering as you wish but thats only because you were hearing wrong i love you was what it was but you never heard

love is not blind that is the last thing that it is love is bound and the more it is bound the less it is blind

let me tell ya you gotta pay attention to signs when life reaches out with a moment like this its a sin if you dont reach back im telling you

depression isnt a war you win its a battle you fight every day you never stop never get to rest its one bloody fray after another

but my god its so beautiful when the boy smiles

and maybe that was love being so vulnerable and allowing someone else in so far they could hurt you but they also give you everything

their fingers seemed to fit together in just the right way effortlessly claspedlike perfect complements

that’s what it feels like when you touch me like millions of tiny universes being born and then dying in the space between your finger and my skin sometimes i forget

people who love themselves don’t hurt other people the more we hate ourselves the more we want others to suffer

its not enough to believe dont you see that you stupid girl you could spend your whole life hoping and believing if a love affair is onesided then its only ever a question never an answer you cant live your life waiting for an answer

i am no king and i am no lord

and i am no soldier atarms said he

im none but a harper and a very poor harper

that am come hither to wed with ye

if you were a lord you should be my lord

and the same if you were a thief said she

and if you are a harper you shall be my harper

for it makes no matter to me to me

for it makes no matter to me

but what if it prove that i am no harper

that i lied for your love most monstrously

why then ill teach you to play and sing

for i dearly love a good harp said she

love the sickest of irony’s sick jokes the place where logic and order go to die

a the soul wanders in the dark until it finds love and so wherever our love goes there we find our soul

q it always happens

a if were lucky and if we let ourselves be blind

q instead of watching out

a instead of always watching out

we live in a dark and romantic and quite tragic world

ive been lonely for so long and ive been hurt so deeply if only i could have met you again a long time ago then i wouldnt have had to take all these detours to get here

tengo shook his head i dont think so this way is just fine this is exactly the right time for both of us  we needed that much time to understand how lonely we really were

there are some experiences in life they havent invented the right words for

i feel like i’ve been split open and stuffed with sunshine

no matter how bad your heart is broken the world doesnt stop for your grief

time has no meaning

love will endure

growth in love comes from a place of absence where the imagination is left to it’s own devices and creates you to be much more then reality would ever allow

one can be very much in love with a woman without wishing to spend the rest of ones life with her

we wanted the freedom to love we wanted the freedom to choose now we have to fight for it

but no matter what love throws at you you have to believe in it you have ot believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily ever after thats why i write these songs because i think love is fearless

i love you more i love you enough to let you go and live your dream i tilted my head and shrugged dont you see i love you more

stubbornly he shook his head no i know that i have to be with you everything else is just  details

i’m a fake fact factory the things i make are the things i make up also as a side business i make love actually i just made that up

the opposite of love is not hate  its apathy its not giving a damn if somebody hates me they must feel something  or they couldnt possibly hate therefore theres some way in which i can get to them

i had to touch you with my hands i had to taste you with my tongue one cant love and do nothing

she was bendable light she shone around every corner of my day

whats your heart telling you to do

i dont know

maybe youre trying too hard to hear it

all the problem of women starts with men all the problem of men ends with women

my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun

coral is far more red than her lips red

if snow be white why then her breasts are dun

if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head

i have seen roses damaskd red and white

but no such roses see i in her cheeks

and in some perfumes is there more delight

than in the breath that from my mistress reeks

i love to hear her speak yet well i know

that music hath a far more pleasing sound

i grant i never saw a goddess go

my mistress when she walks treads on the ground

and yet by heaven i think my love as rare

as any she belied with false compare

in fairy tales the princesses kiss the frogs and the frogs become princes in real life the pricesses kiss princes and the princes turn into frogs

i close my eyes thinking that there is nothing like an embrace after an absence nothing like fitting my face into the curve of his shoulder and filling my lungs with the scent of him

love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved it finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being his inner self whether or not he is actually present whether or not he is still alive at all ceases somehow to be of importance

it seems to me now that the plain state of being human is dramatic enough for anyone you dont need to be a heroin addict or a performance poet to experience extremity you just have to love someone

but whatever

whenever this ends i want you to know

that right now

i love you forever

i love you marks my heart is completely and utterly yours and unfortunately for you the rest of me comes with it

i’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell

to die upon the hand i love so well

sensitive people usually love deeply and hate deeply they dont know any other way to live than by extremes because thier emotional theromastat is broken

he opened his eyes and stared up at me as if i were the door out of arcadia and back to the true sky thats what makes you my favorite he reached up and wiped a tear off my cheek with his thumb every wicked bit of you

perhaps all romance is like that not a contract between equal parties but an explosion of dreams and desires that can find no outlet in everyday life only a drama will do and while the fireworks last the sky is a different colour

love is not finding someone to live with its finding someone you cant live without

find the things that matter and hold on to them and fight for them and refuse to let them go

i would never let anyone else borrow my heart if i know there’s a chance in hell you might want it back

loving you was like going to war i never came back the same

its easy to look back and see it and its easy to give the advice but the sad fact is most people dont look beneath the surface until its too late

it is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself

than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all

connected with you

when someone you love says goodbye you can stare long and hard at the door they closed and forget to see all the doors god has open in front of you

i make love with a focus and intensity that most people reserve for sleep

but hurry lets entwine ourselves as one our mouth broken our soul bitten by love so time discovers us safely destroyed

nothing had changed i was the stupid one again i was the girl who never understood who she was to people

ones life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others by means of love friendship and compassion

he must love you very much gavril said once i had my footing

i couldnt look at him what makes you say that gavril sighed ive known maxon since he was a child hes never stood up to his father like that

love is a drama of contradictions

he’s dozed off again but i kiss him awake which seems to startle him then he smiles as if he’d be happy to lie there gazing at me forever

the problem of course was that he saw the world in black and white and he got to decide what was black and what was white you cant love a person who lives that way without fearing him too maybe even hating him a little

love may forgive all infirmities and love still in spite of them but love cannot cease to will their removal

we all have an old knot in the heart we wish to untie

you smiled and talked to me of nothing and i felt that for this i had been waiting long

friendship often ends in love but love in friendship never

when i first met you thats what i remember i looked up at the sky and thought im going to love this person because even the sky looks different

love is an endless mystery because there is no reasonable cause that could explain it

thats what i love about aibileen she can take the most complicated things in life and wrap them up so small and simple theyll fit right in your pocket

im like a starving man who has been given food maybe hes cold and his clothes are torn and hes ashamed but hes not unhappy

smirking he says whatever spell you just tried to cast on me it didnt work so i think you need to go back to hogwarts

i have such a fear of finding another like myself and such a desire to find one i am so utterly lonely but i also have such a fear that my isolation be broken through and i no longer be the head and ruler of my universe

do people always fall in love with things they cant have

always carol said smiling too

he tells me to pick the music i’m not sure if he knows that handing me his ipod is like handing me the window to his soul

you dumbass i crooned kissing her on the forehead you dont share me you own me

and when love came to us twice

and lied to us twice

we decided to never love again

that was fair

fair to us

and fair to love itself

we ask for no mercy or no

we are strong enough to live

and to die and to

attend the boxing matches go to the racetrack

live on luck and skill

and if you cant sleep alone

be careful of the words you speak in your sleep

and

ask for no mercy

no miracles

and dont forget

time is meant to be wasted

and death is useless

you’re in my every breath and every thought intertwined so deep inside me that love’s not a strong enough word—you have my devotion your name branded on my soul my wolf yours to command a hundred years it’ll never be enough i want eternity

the thing with your hearts desire is that your heart doesnt even know what it desires until it turns up

real friendship or love is not manufactured or achieved by an act of will or intention friendship is always an act of recognition

americans are forever searching for love in forms it never takes in places it can never be it must have something to do with the vanished frontier

the worst thing you can do if you miss or need someone is let them know it

desire is the kind of thing that

eats you

and

leaves you starving

not enough he said letting her hair slip through his fingers if i kiss you all day everyday for the rest of my life it wont be enough

touchstone watched suddenly conscious that he probably only had five seconds left to be alone with sabriel to say something to say anything perhaps the last five seconds they ever would have alone together

i am not afraid he said to himself

i love you he whispered i hope you dont mind

love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning

they say if a man knew himself

he would know all mankind

i say if a man loved mankind

he would know something of himself

could it be that the heart that you seek is no longer my own i have given my heart to another

the boy the one in the inn with the unicorn

you should have let me take it back then for my sisters and me we could have been young again well into the next age of the world your boy will break it or waste it or lose it they all do

nonetheless he has my heart i hope your sisters will not be too hard on you when you return to them without it

you dont know when youre twentythree

she didnt know at twentythree

love comes with a knife not some shy question and not with fears for its reputation

in a universe of ambiguity this kind of certainty comes only once and never again no matter how many lifetimes you live

i think heaven will be like a first kiss

sometimes your heart is the only thing worth listening to

chiron had said once that nations were the most foolish of mortal inventions no man is worth more than another wherever he is from

but what if he is your friend achilles had asked him feet kicked up on the wall of the rosequartz cave or your brother should you treat him the same as a stranger

you ask a question that philosophers argue over chiron had said he is worth more to you perhaps but the stranger is someone else’s friend and brother so which life is more important

we had been silent we were fourteen and these things were too hard for us now that we are twentyseven they still feel too hard

he is half of my soul as the poets say he will be dead soon and his honor is all that will remain it is his child his dearest self should i reproach him for it i have saved briseis i cannot save them all

i know now how i would answer chiron i would say there is no answer whichever you choose you are wrong

i always think of each night as a song or each moment as a song but now im seeing we dont live in a single song we move from song to song from lyric to lyric from chord to chord there is no ending here its an infinite playlist

the greatest thing youll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return

to fall in love is easy even to remain in it is not difficult our human loneliness is cause enough but it is a hard quest worth making to find a comrade through whose steady presence one becomes steadily the person one desires to be

there has to be a moment at the beginning where you wonder whether you’re in love with the person or in love with the feeling of love itself

if the moment doesn’t pass that’s it—you’re done

and if the moment does pass it never goes that far it stands in the distance ready for whenever you want it back sometimes it’s even there when you thought you were searching for something else like an escape route or your lovers’ face

for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me

her heart had grown so familiar to the pain of life without him that to respond now seemed too large a pleasure she could not endure if pain was love then she loved fiercely yet knew she could not be near that boy again

i dont ask you to love me always like this but i ask you to remember somewhere inside me therell always be the person i am tonight

before i go he said and paused  i may kiss her

love lasts about seven years thats how long it takes for the cells of the body to totally replace themselves

what a terrible feeling to love soemone and not be able to help them

don’t let mental blocks control you set yourself free confront your fear and turn the mental blocks into building blocks

you had to be willing to fight in order for a love story to last a life time

if someone does not want me it is not the end of the world but if i do not want me the world is nothing but endings

stains are even worse when youre the only one who can see them

marius and cosette were in the dark in regard to each other they did not speak they did not bow they were not acquainted they saw each other and like the stars in the sky separated by millions of leagues they lived by gazing upon each other

if i had a single flower for every time i think about you i could walk forever in my garden

nobody knows you

you dont know yourself

and i who am half in love with you

what am i in love with

my own imaginings

love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own

her desires are mine her wishes are mine should even the world stand against her my blade will be at her side and should it fail to protect her let my own existence be forfeit  ash

please touch me i pray

i mean i hope youre happy

but the sky is still the sky without you

and im not surprised by that anymore

it’s a weird phrase in english in love like it’s a sea you drown in or a town you live in you don’t get to be in anything else—in friendship or in anger or in hope all you can be in is love

how bout a shot of truth in that denial cocktail

you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner elizabeth bennett

im yours for everfor ever and ever here i stand im as firm as a rock if youll only trust me how little youll be disappointed be mine as i am yours

are you asking me to undress tris

a nervous laugh gurgles from my throat only  partially

love is a trap when it appears we see only its light not its shadows

love love until the night collapses

dexter i love you so much so so much and i probably always will i just dont like you anymore im sorry

it’s hard to communicate anything exactly and that’s why perfect relationships between people are difficult to find

your truest friends are the ones who will stand by you in your darkest momentsbecause theyre willing to brave the shadows with youand in your greatest momentsbecause theyre not afraid to let you shine

everyones a little crazy some people just hide it better than others

one word more you look as if you thought it tainted you to be

loved by me you cannot avoid it nay i if i would cannot

cleanse you from it but i would not if i could i have never

loved any woman before my life has been too busy my thoughts

too much absorbed with other things now i love and will love

but do not be afraid of too much expression on my part

so for now

i will miss you like i’ll never see you again

and the next time i see you

i will kiss you like i’ll never kiss you again

and when i fall asleep beside you

i will fall asleep as if i’ll never wake up again

because i don’t know if i will

i don’t know if i will

i will love you like the world is ending

rachel to julia

youve got to have someone who loves your body who doesnt define you but sees you who loves what he sees who you dont have to struggle to be good enough for

i regret tobias tilts his head and sighs i regret my choice

what choice

dauntless he says i was born abnegation i was planning on leaving dauntless and becoming factionless but i met her and i felt like maybe i could make something more of my decision

he looks at her and smiles youre sort of dangerous you know

she stares at him me

yeah he says sitting back im way too honest with you

you know im old in some waysin otherswell im just a little girl i like sunshine and pretty things and cheerfulnessand i dread responsibility

when you leave

without a word i shall gently let you go

how many loved your moments of glad grace

and loved your beauty with love false or true

but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you

and loved the sorrows of your changing face

he is half of my soul as the poets say

she put one hand on mine when someone is in your heart they’re never truly gone they can come back to you even at unlikely times

we are made of all those who have built and broken us

its usually the selfish people who are loved the most they do what you deny yourself and you love them for it you give them your heart

if people are going to be allowed to say we love you and i love you theyd better have the backbone to prove it love isnt just a word

have i told you how hideous you look tonight cardan asks leaning back in the elaborately carved chair the warmth of his words turning the question into something like a compliment

no i say glad to be annoyed back into the present tell me

i cant

when a woman loves you shes not satisfied until she possesses your soul because shes weak she has a rage for domination and nothing less will satisfy her

and we all know love is a glass which makes even a monster appear fascinating

you know what the worst thing i can imagine is simon had said not trusting someone i love

alone with everybody

the flesh covers the bone

and they put a mind

in there and

and the women break

vases against the walls

and them men drink too

and nobody finds the

but they keep

crawling in and out

the bone and the

for more than

theres no chance

at all

we are all trapped

by a singular

the one

the city dumps fill

the junkyards fill

the madhouses fill

the hospitals fill

the graveyards fill

knees suddenly weak she reached for his forearms to stabilize herself you came for me

he beamed looking for all the world like a selfless daring hero

don’t sound so surprised dropping the cane he pulled her into a crushing embrace that tore her away from wolf and lifted her clean off the floor it turns out you are worth a lot of money on the black market

if i never see you again

i will always carry you

on my fingertips

and at brain edges

and in centers

of what i am of

what remains

some people fall in love over and over again while some people can only do it once

like this

if anyone asks you

how the perfect satisfaction

of all our sexual wanting

will look lift your face

and say

like this

when someone mentions the gracefulness

of the nightsky climb up on the roof

and dance and say

like this

if anyone wants to know what spirit is

or what god’s fragrance means

lean your head toward him or her

keep your face there close

like this

when someone quotes the old poetic image

about clouds gradually uncovering the moon

slowly loosen knot by knot the strings

of your robe

like this

if anyone wonders how jesus raised the dead

don’t try to explain the miracle

kiss me on the lips

like this like this

when someone asks what it means

to die for love point

here

if someone asks how tall i am frown

and measure with your fingers the space

between the creases on your forehead

this tall

the soul sometimes leaves the body the returns

when someone doesn’t believe that

walk back into my house

like this

when lovers moan

they’re telling our story

like this

i am a sky where spirits live

stare into this deepening blue

while the breeze says a secret

like this

when someone asks what there is to do

light the candle in his hand

like this

how did joseph’s scent come to jacob

how did jacob’s sight return

a little wind cleans the eyes

like this

when shams comes back from tabriz

he’ll put just his head around the edge

of the door to surprise us

like this

all i want from you is to trust me with what little you can and grow in loving people around you with the same love i share with you its not your job to change them or to convince them you are free to love without an agenda

selftalk reflects your innermost feelings

real museums are places where time is transformed into space

true love is born from understanding

for love is no part of the dreamworld love belongs to desire and desire is always cruel

the question love is whether you want me enough to take the risk

i pray you do not fall in love with me for i am falser than vows made in wine

take my hand and well make it  i swear

its good to let god pick a man for you we dont do so well when we pick them ourselves they end up lipsticks in a drawer all those wrong colors you thought looked so good in the package

no matter how long or how difficult we will undo whatever that moroi boy has done to you

i managed a wavering smile tasting blood in my mouth you sure about that dad because hes done everything to me

my wife and i just dont have the same feelings for each other we used to have i guess i just dont love her anymore and she doesnt love me what can i do

the feeling isnt there anymore i asked

thats right he reaffirmed and we have three children were really concerned about what do you suggest

i told you the feeling just isnt there anymore

you dont understand the feeling of love just isnt there

then love her if the feeling isnt there thats a good reason to love her

but how do you love when you dont love

my friend  love is a verb love  the feeling  is a fruit of love the verb so love her serve her sacrifice listen to her empathize appreciate affirm her are you willing to do that

if you didnt remember something happening was it because it never had happened or because you wished it hadnt

in the absence of love we began slowly but surely to fall apart

i am as wrapped up in her as a vine that clings to a tree seeking for sustenance she’s tied me to her for eternity she’s my home she’s my reason for being to win and hold her heart is my only purpose

i will be with her again or i will die there aren’t any other options

my love is meatloaf flavored i just wish my meatloaf was also meatloaf flavored

she asked if i loved another woman so i answered honestly and said dinner was great but i could go for dessert

maybe you could be mine  or maybe we’ll be entwined  aimless in this sexless foreplay

child its a very bad thing for a woman to face the worst that can happen to her because after shes faced the worst she cant ever really fear anything again scarlett always save something to fear— even as you save something to love

i love you i love you i send this message through my fingers and into his up his arm and into his heart hear me i love you and im sorry to leave you

let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred

he promised us that everything would be okay i was a child but i knew that everything would not be okay that did not make my father a liar it made him my father

no one compares to you but theres no you except in my dreams tonight

if i were rain

that joins sky and earth that otherwise never touch

could i join two hearts as well

im beginning to think that maybe its not just how much you love someone maybe what matters is who you are when youre with them

happiness is part of who we are joy is the feeling

love is one of the true mysteries he said at last the truest and the deepest of all one thing maerad to love is never wrong it may be disastrous it may never be possible it may be the deepest agony but it is never wrong

well you can think what you want so long as you remember  no matter how ordinary things seem between us  im still here still in love with you and care about you more than any other guy evil or otherwise ever will

gamble everything for love if youre a true human being

i take no joy in mead nor meat and song and laughter have become suspicious strangers to me i am a creature of grief and dust and bitter longings there is an empty place within me where my heart was once

time is too slow for those who wait too swift for those who fear too long for those who grieve too short for those who rejoice but for those who love time is eternity

but you cant shut everyone out i mean you have to have someone to love  someone to hold on to   someone

i feel it when i sorrow most

tis better to have loved and lost

than never to have loved at all

everything want to be loved us sing and dance and holler just trying to be loved

isnt hate merely the result of wounded love

infantile love follows the principle i love because i am loved

mature love follows the principle i am loved because i love

immature love says i love you because i need you

mature love says i need you because i love you

it never gets easier missing you and sometimes i wonder if it ever will

my heart is afraid that it will have to suffer

give the ones you love wings to fly roots to come back and reasons to stay

love doesnt always come when you want it to sometimes it just happens despite your will

how can you still count yourself a knight when you have forsaken every vow you ever swore

he loved her

jay heaton her best friend since childhood was in love with her he didnt say it but she knew that it was true

and it was so weird to even be thinking it but she was in love with him too

if i could bronze my love it’d be worthy of a silver medal

and i didnt choose it kat i chose you

we met less than a week ago and in that time ive done nothing but lie and cheat and betray you i know but if you give me a chanceall i want is to protect you to be near you for as long as im able

do not allow me to forget you

i see it now though

and then he touches me again and my convictions disappear like smoke in the wind

tomorrow i will leave tomorrow i will stop delaying the inevitable tomorrow i will quit lying to myself and to him

just one last time sweets just one last fix that’s all i need

and that is why i now understand addiction

he brought out the worst in me and was the best thing that ever happened to me

but i miss screamin and fightin and kissin in the rain and its  am and im cursin your name youre so in love the you act insane and thats the way i loved you

i saw the world from the stars point of view and it looked unbearably lonely

i could’ve sworn i was telling the truth when i told you i didn’t miss you

if you have reasons to love someone you don’t love them

i know i’m not supposed to say this but i love you

love comforteth like sunshine after rain

i was his exception and as much as i had tried to fight my feelings he was mine

love is not all

love is not all it is not meat nor drink

nor slumber nor a roof against the rain

nor yet a floating spar to men that sink

and rise and sink and rise and sink again

love can not fill the thickened lung with breath

nor clean the blood nor set the fractured bone

yet many a man is making friends with death

even as i speak for lack of love alone

it well may be that in a difficult hour

pinned down by pain and moaning for release

or nagged by want past resolution’s power

i might be driven to sell your love for peace

or trade the memory of this night for food

it well may be i do not think i would

i might kiss you

i might be bad at it

thats not possible

everything that happens to you matters to me

you can’t if you can’t feel it if it never

rises from the soul and sways

the heart of every single hearer

with deepest power in simple ways

you’ll sit forever gluing things together

cooking up a stew from other’s scraps

made from your heap of dying ash

let apes and children praise your art

if their admiration’s to your taste

but you’ll never speak from heart to heart

unless it rises up from your heart’s space

sometimes it’s like people are a million times more beautiful to you in your mind it’s like you see them through a special lens — but maybe if it’s how you see themthat’s how they really are it’s like the whole tree falling in the forest thing

i recognized you instantly all of our lives flashed through my mind in a split second i felt a pull so strongly towards you that i almost couldnt stop it

it was rather beautiful the way he put her insecurities to sleep the way he dove into her eyes and starved all the fears and tasted all the dreams she kept coiled beneath her bones

love is like a virus it can happen to anybody at any time

you know what’s a great metaphor for love sleeping beauty because you have to plow through this incredible thicket of thorns in order to get to beauty and even then when you get there you still have to wake her up

im not supposed to miss you im not supposed to care

don’t spoil me with your lies love me with your truth

you put me through hell on purpose made me suffer and there’s no end in sight i don’t know what the fuck you’re doing ace but this dr jekyll and mr hyde shit ain’t cutting it with me

it is that we are never so defenseless against suffering as when we love never so helplessly unhappy as when we have lost our loved object or its love

you can be in love and you can be in a relationship but they’re not always the same thing

when we are in love we are convinced nobody else will do but as time goes others do do and often do do much much better

sometimes loneliness makes the loudest noise

and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood

if anyone were to find out— i began

a real relationship is twoway

two minds with but a single thought two hearts that beat as one

love didnt make you weak it made you stronger

how we need that security how we need another soul to cling to another body to keep us warm to rest and trust to give your soul in confidence i need this i need someone to pour myself into

when you say i and my too much you lose the capacity to understand the we and our

and we certainly wouldnt write about it

i didnt care who kissed you first as long as i kissed you last

i love you every day and now i will miss you every day

you dont need to justify your love you dont need to explain your love you just need to practice your love practice creates the master

regret is mostly caused by not having

that this girl would know exactly how to shatter me

a profound love between two people involves after all the power and chance of doing profound hurt

i know there may be universes out there where i made different choices and they led me somewhere else led me to someone else and my heart breaks for every single version of me that didnt end up with you

i only have so much willpower helen he whispered and since you apparently sleep in the most ridiculously transparent tank top ive ever seen im going to have to ask you to get under the covers before i do something stupid

i once loved a girl who almost loved me but not as much as she loved john cusack

after all a woman who doesnt love cats is never going to be make a man happy

your inner strength is your outer foundation

love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punishd and cured is that the lunacy is so

ordinary that the whippers are in love too

love is a game

for the next x or o

true love isnt expressed in passionately whispered words an intimate kiss or a embrace before two people are married love is expressed in selfcontrol patience even words left unsaid

a man is lucky if he is the first love of a woman a woman is lucky if she is the last love of a man

i like being the girl nobody can have

perhaps watching someone you love suffer can teach you even more than suffering yourself can

it is only with true love and compassion that we can begin to mend what is broken in the world it is these two blessed things that can begin to heal all broken hearts

the reality of loving god is loving him like hes a superhero who actually saved you from stuff rather than a santa claus who merely gave you some stuff

loving someone always requires you to not love others

every life needs a little space it leaves room for good things to enter it

maybe its just hiding somewhere or gone on a trip to come home but falling in love is always a pretty crazy thing it might appear out of the blue and just grab you who knows — maybe even tomorrow

the strength of a love is always misjudged if we evaluate it by its immediate cause and not the stress that went before it the dark and hollow space full of disappointment and loneliness that precedes all the great events in the hearts history

when male authors write love stories the heroine tends to end up dead

i miss you in waves and tonight i’m drowning you left me fending for my life and it feels like you’re the only one who can bring me back to the shore alive

its more like you meet someone and you fall in love and you hope that that person is the one—and then at some point you have to put down your chips you just have to make a commitment and hope that youre right

in love at first sight

but i will always believe

that the people

we love

we have loved before

many many many times before

and when we stumble

through grace and circumstance

and that brilliant illusion of choice

to finally meet them again

we feel it faster

each time through

the one glance

that set life alight

staring through the layers

of lifetimes and stolen glances

and first kisses and hands held

the brace against the weight

and unrelenting tide

in love at first sight

but am not burdened with the misconception

that its a first sight

at all

vladimir did great things—so could she besides they come first right

not always

i stared id had they come first drilled into me since i was a child it was what all guardians believed only the dhampirs whod run away from their duty didnt subscribe to that what he said was almost like treason

sometimes rose you have to know when to put yourself first

he looked at his friend perhaps for the last time and said what he had always known from the moment they’d met when he’d understood that the prince was his brother in soul i love you

it is beautiful to express love and even more beautiful to feel it

can he love her can the soul really be satisfied with such polite affections to love is to burn  to be on fire like juliet or guinevere or eloise

she conquered her demons and wore her scars like wings

the knowledge that she would never be loved in return acted upon her ideas as a tide acts upon cliffs

you might as well make yourself fly as to make yourself love

real love has little to do with falling its a climb up the rocky face of a mountain hard work and most people are too selfish or too scared to bother

very few reach the critical point in their relationship that summons the attention of the light and the dark that place where they will make a commitment to love no matter what obstaclesor temptations appear in their path

i used to think i knew everything i was a smart person who got things done and because of that the higher i climbed the more i could look down and scoff at what seemed silly or simple even religion

theres only one thing that can heal the heart only one its love gaara

i love you i whisper i love you exactly as you are

love is supposed to move mountains to make the world go round to be all you need but it falls apart at the deatils it cant save a single person

love is keeping the promise anyway

embracing tao you become embraced

supple breathing gently you become reborn

clearing your vision you become clear

nurturing your beloved you become impartial

opening your heart you become accepted

accepting the world you embrace tao

bearing and nurturing

creating but not owning

this is love

love entered in my heart one day

but when it begged that it might stay

i let it stay and rest

it broke my nights with sorrowing

it filled my heart with fears

and when my soul was prone to sing

it filled my eyes with tears

butnow that it has gone its way

i miss the dear ole pain

and sometimes in the night i pray

that love might come again

emotion without reason lets people walk all over you reason without emotion is a mask for cruelty

it is very difficult to live among people you love and hold back from offering them advice

just in case you ever foolishly forget im never not thinking of you

you stay safe you love you survive you laugh and cry and struggle and sometimes you fail and sometimes you succeed you push

the true measure of a man is how he treats you when others are not looking

i realized when you look at your mother you are looking at the purest love you will ever know

intrigued by that enigma he dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her

there are all kinds of ways for a relationship to be tested even broken some irrevocably it’s the endings we’re unprepared for

we have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community

ronans second secret was adam parrish

the eskimo has fiftynames for snow because it is important to them there ought to be as many for love

her heart  like every heart if only its fallen sides were cleared away  was an inexhaustible fountain of love she loved everything she saw

for some people the point of no return begins at the very moment their souls become aware of each others’ existence

what sexual preference do you hope she has happiness isnt that cool

without love we all like birds with broken wings

this is the part where i kiss you

everything is clearer when youre in love

i love you even if there isn’t any me or any love or even any life i love you

love only grows by sharing you can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others

poor fellow i think he is in love with you

how sad and bad and mad it was  but then how it was sweet

o here

will i set up my everlasting rest

and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars

from this worldwearied flesh eyes look your last

arms take your last embrace and lips o you

the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss

a dateless bargain to engrossing death

its risky falling in love

what a horrible way to put it he said

if music be the food of love play on

but youve slipped under my skin invaded my blood and seized my heart

only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love

he went through life with his hands firmly shoved into his pockets she danced

youre my star a stargazer too

and i wish that i were heaven

with a billion eyes to look at you

i want him to see the flowers in my eyes and hear the songs in my hands

and you will always be alone

he can touch your soul and there is a difference between having your heart break and having your soul shatter

mom how do you know if the guy is the guy

you mean if he’ll be a good husband she pauses then says the ticket is for the man to love the woman more than she loves him

shouldn’t it be equal

mom cackles it can never be equal

but what if the woman loves the man more

with a chaste heart

with pure eyes i celebrate your beauty

holding the leash of blood

so that it might leap out and trace your outline

where you lie down in my ode

as in a land of forests or in surf

in aromatic loam or in sea music

equally beautiful your feet

arched by primeval tap of wind or sound

your ears small shells

of the splendid american sea

your breasts of level plentitude

fulfilled by living light

your flying eyelids of wheat

revealing or enclosing

the two deep countries of your eyes

the line your shoulders have divided into pale regions

loses itself and blends into the compact halves of an apple

continues separating your beauty down into two columns of

to sink into the two grapes of your feet

where your twin symmetrical tree burns again and rises

over the pact of sea and earth

from what materials

did your body come together

swelling like baking bread to signal silvered hills

the cleavage of one petal

until alone remained

the fine and firm feminine form

it is not only light that falls over the world spreading inside your body

yet suffocate itself

so much is clarity

taking its leave of you

as if you were on fire within

the moon lives in the lining of your skin

and it seemed so easy once he capitulated it seemed natural and right

kev wasnt certain if he was surrendering to win or to his own passion for her only that there was no more holding back he would take her and he would give her everything he had every part of his soul even the broken pieces

i found him carefully studying me his lips in a thin line has anyone ever taken care of you he asked quietly

no i’d long since stopped feeling sorry for myself about it

i told you he whispers back i can feel his breath just tickling the space behind my ear making my hair prick up on my neck i like you

you dont know me i say quickly

i want to though

it’s easy to fall in love ben the hard part comes when you want out

have you ever felt the longing for someone you could admire for something not to look down at but up to

i didnt fall in love of course

its never up to you

but she was walking back and forth

and i was passing through

the love we give away is the only love we keep

i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality this is why right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant

everything about her has to do with me

we’d read about sirens in english this fall greek mythology bullshit about women so beautiful their voices so enchanting that men did anything for them turned out that mythology crap was real because every time i saw her i lost my mind

daddy i whispered feeling my own breath hitch in my throat i love you

just when i was sure he was asleep the one corner of his mouth lifted in a smile i knew that he murmured always knew that

tell me the story

about how the sun loved the moon so much

that she died every night

just to let him breathe

the gospel is this we are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared believe yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in jesus christ than we ever dared hope

but youre so busy changing the world

just one smile can change all of mine

find a woman who makes you feel more alive she wont make life perfect but shell make it infinitely more interesting and then love her with all thats in you

i thought i was going to sweat five years before id feel like this

i wanted it as much as you did ive just got a hell of a poker face i smiled pressing my lips against his

no matter how much you love someone you still want to have you own way

the practice of love offers no place of safety we risk loss hurt pain we risk being acted upon by forces outside our control

i loved him

i couldnt pinpoint what made me so certain but i knew it then as surely as i knew my name or the color of the sky or any fact written in a book

could he feel it too

maxon broke the kiss and looked at me youre so pretty when you are a mess

i laughed nervously thank you for that and for the rain and for not giving up

he ran his fingers along my cheek and nose and chin youre worth it i dont think that you get that youre worth it to me

maybe sometimes we can only see the truth about ourselves if someone shows us where to look

is it possible not to ever know your typenot to even know you have a typeuntil quite suddenly you do

i cant sleep i cant eat i cant do anything but think about him at night i dream of him all day i wait to see him and when i do see him my heart turns over and i think i will faint with desire

hide yourself in god so when a man wants to find you he will have to go there first

why i wake early

hello sun in my face

hello you who made the morning

and spread it over the fields

and into the faces of the tulips

and the nodding morning glories

and into the windows of even the

miserable and the crotchety –

best preacher that ever was

dear star that just happens

to be where you are in the universe

to keep us from everdarkness

to ease us with warm touching

to hold us in the great hands of light –

watch now how i start the day

what was it like to lose him asked sorrow

there was a long pause before i responded

it was like hearing every goodbye ever said to

me—said all at once

to find out if she really loved me i hooked her up to a lie detector and just as i suspected my machine was broken

and even as im kissing him and kissing him and kissing him i wish i were kissing him wanting more more more more like i cant get enough never will be able to get enough

marveling at his own boldness he said softly i would enter your sleep if i could and guard you there and slay the thing that hounds you as i would if it had the courage to face me in fair daylight but i cannot come in unless you dream of me

a quiet but indomitable voice behind me said i believe this is my dance it was him i could feel his presence the warmth of him seeped into my back and i quivered all over like spring leaves in a warm breeze

there will never be a good time financially to get married unless youre shaq or ray romano but somehow people manage if your man is using money as an excuse not to marry you its your relationship thats insecure not his bank account

i love you you’re mine i’ll kill any bastard who tries to take you from me

we should love not fall in love because everything that falls gets broken

the truth washe was in love with her totally overtheline nogoingback notevendeadwouldhepart kind of shit

the best use of life is love the best expression of love is time the best time to love is now

you are what happiness means to me and i would rather have today with you than forever with anyone else

give me the love that leads the way

the faith that nothing can dismay

the hope no disappointments tire

the passion thatll burn like fire

let me not sink to be a clod

…the sad part is that i will probably end up loving you without you for much longer than i loved you when i knew you

some people might find that strange

but the truth of it is that the amount of love you feel for someone and the impact they have on you as a person is in no way relative to the amount of time you have known them

you have to be very fond of men very very fond you have to be very fond of them to love them otherwise theyre simply unbearable

why did he have to be so gorgeous why did he have to stand so close and why did i still love him so much

to love is easy to be in a relationship is extremely difficult

you know what the secret is its so simple we love one another were nice to one another do you know how rare that is  carmen

i really dont even know you and yet in my life you are forever entangled to my history inextricably bound

when you love you should not think you can direct the course of love for love if it finds you worthy directs your course

but that afternoon he asked himself with his infinite capacity for illusion if such pitiless indifference might not be a subterfuge for hiding the torments of love

by night love tie your heart to mine and the two

together in their sleep will defeat the darkness

the heart is a strange beast and not ruled by logic

what barrier is there that love cannot break

you think im cute he said thinkly pulling on her hand

she was glad he couldnt see her face i think youre

beautiful breathtaking like the person in a greek myth who makes one of the gods stop caring about being a god

its not at all hard to understand a person its only hard to listen without bias

i feel…and i have reason to believe…that we could come to mean something to each other

you asked me to go out with you i know you probably changed your mind but you should know the answer was yes its always been yes when it comes to you

i love you for who you are not who the world thinks you should be

i miss you

i miss you i miss you i miss you

be ready because when i see you ill never let you go again

when all is said and done the weather and love are the two elements about which one can never be sure

you were a summer gift one ill always treasure you were a dream i never wanted to wake up from you opened my eyes to things ill never really see youre the best thing that will ever happen to me

you don’t need scores of suitors you need only one… if he’s the right one

get up shahrzad alkhayzuran you kneel before no one least of all me

but what can be done the one who loves must share the fate of the one he loves

say it i gritted out

the high lord of the night court is your mate

i cant promise not to make you mad i cant promise that i wont hurt you all i can promise is that i want you in my life and ill do anything to keep you there

there is love of course and then theres life its enemy

human relationships always help us to carry on because they always presuppose further developments a future  and also because we live as if our only task was precisely to have relationships with other people

she let out a laugh and then she put her hand over her mouth like she was angry at herself for forgetting her sadness

i know i am but summer to your heart

and not the full four seasons of the year

and you must welcome from another part

such noble moods as are not mine my dear

no gracious weight of golden fruits to sell

have i nor any wise and wintry thing

and i have loved you all too long and well

to carry still the high sweet breast of spring

wherefore i say o love as summer goes

i must be gone steal forth with silent drums

that you may hail anew the bird and rose

when i come back to you as summer comes

else will you seek at some not distant time

even your summer in another clime

people will walk in and walk out of your life but the one whose footstep made a long lasting impression is the one you should never allow to walk out

often you dont know whether a woman is friend enemy or lover until it is too late sometimes she is all three

and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains but have not love i am nothing

no magnus strode toward him i didnt call you because im tired of you only wanting me around when you need something im tired of watching you be in love with someone elsesomeone incidentally who will never love you back not the way i do

the desire to love someone always exceeds the desire to be loved by someone  thats exactly why we end up loving the person who doesnt deserve that love

every time i close my eyes its like a dark paradise no one compares to you but theres no you except in my dreams tonight

lately i cant help wanting us

to be like other people

for example if i were a smoker

youd lift a match to the cigarette

just as i put it between my lips

its never been like that

between us none of that

easy chemistry no quick half automatic

flares everything between us

had to be learned

behind my book all my fantasies

of seduction run up

against the rocks

tell me again

why you dont like

sex in the afternoon

no dont tell me

ill never understand you

never understand us americas strangest

loving couple they never

and rarely look at each other

into each others eyes i mean

it has to kill one of us celia says quietly

to make one person the center of your world is bound to end in disaster there are too many factors outside your control

our lips met hungrily and his clever artistic hands wrapped around my hips a sudden buzz from my regular cell phone startled me from the kissing

dont said adrian his eyes ablaze and breathing ragged

what if theres a crisis at school i asked what if angeline accidentally stole one of the campus buses and drove it into the library

why would she do that

are you saying she wouldnt

he sighed go check it

youve got it all wrong

you didnt come here to master unconditional love this is where you came from and where youll return

you came here to learn personal love

infused with divinity

lived through the grace of stumbling

demonstrated through the beauty of messing up

you didnt come here to be perfect you already are

you came here to be gorgeously human flawed and fabulous

and rising again into remembering

but unconditional love stop telling that story

love in truth doesnt need any adjectives

it doesnt require modifiers

it doesnt require the condition of perfection

it only asks you to show up

and do your best

that you stay present and feel fully

that you shine and fly and laugh and cry and hurt and heal and fall and get back up and play and work and live and die as you

its enough

its plenty

day leans in toward me he reaches up to touch my face i can tell it still hurts him to use his fingers and his nails are dark with dried blood youre brilliant he says but youre a fool to stay wish someone like me

i close my eyes at the touch of his hand then were both fools

tucker why would you tell me now if its against the rules

clara because i love you

do you love me westley is that it’

he couldn’t believe it ‘do i love you my god if your love were a grain of sand mine would be a universe of beaches if your love were—‘

‘there has not been—‘

‘if you’re teasing me westley i’m just going to kill you’

‘how can you even dream i might be teasing’

‘well you haven’t once said you loved me’

‘that’s all you need easy i love you okay want it louder i love you spell it out should i i ellohveeee whyohyou want it backward you love i’

‘you are teasing now aren’t you’

i will find you

in the farthest corner i will find you

i touch the tip of my finger to his lips there are secrets in here i say i want them out

he tries to bite my finger

i steal it back

you were born together and together you shall be forevermore

you shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days

ay you shall be together even in the silent memory of god

but let there be spaces in your togetherness

and let the winds of the heavens dance between you

love one another but make not a bond of love

let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls

fill each others cup but drink not from one cup

give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf

sing and dance together and be joyous but let each one of you be alone

even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music

give your hearts but not into each others keeping

for only the hand of life can contain your hearts

and stand together yet not too near together

for the pillars of the temple stand apart

and the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each others shadow

would you just stay with me

stay with you what for look at us were already fighting

so what

so its not gonna be easy its gonna be really hard and were gonna have to work at this everyday but i wanna do that because i want you i want all of you forever you and me everyday

i’ve never been the one not for anybody

he closed the distance between them

you’ll get used to it he tipped her face up to his kissed her

why why am i the one

because my life opened up and it flooded with color when you walked back into it

we need to help people to discover the true meaning of love love is generally confused with dependence those of us who have grown in true love know that we can love only in proportion to our capacity for independence

if loneliness was a choice what was the other option to settle for secondbest and try to be happy with that and was that fair to the person you settled for

i am lost without you i am soulless a drifter without a home a solitary bird in a flight to nowhere i am all these things and i am nothing at all this my darling is my life without you i long for you to show me how to live again

from the stars to the stars

i’ll tell them she said i’ll tell them it was my fault

he looked at her gold eyes incredulous you can’t lie to them

i am beginning to understand said the little prince there is a flower i think that she has tamed me

it was finally becoming clear to her that love wasnt about finding someone perfect to marry love was about seeing through to the truth of a person and accepting all their shades of light and dark love was an ability

and its relentless

just knowing you exist changed the world for me

im telling you this for one reason and one reason only no matter how sure you are of someones love its always nice to hear it

it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love

two separate beings in different circumstances face to face in freedom and seeking justification of their existence through one another will always live an adventure full of risk and promise p

you said move on where do i go

people who meet in airports are seventytwo percent more likely to fall for each other than people who meet anywhere else

you need just the right amount of fuck the world and the right amount of belief in somethingand you need the right amount of love

if you love something let it go

if you dont love something definitely let it go

basically just drop everything who cares

dimitris voice snapped my attention back to him thats adrian ivashkov he said the name the same way everyone else did

this is the second time ive seen you with him

yeah i replied glibly we hang out sometimes

dimitri arched an eyebrow then jerked his head back toward where wed come from you hang out in his room a lot

several retorts popped into my head and then a golden one took precedence what happens between him and me is none of your business i managed a tone very similar to the one hed used on me when making a similar comment about him and tasha

actually as long as youre at the academy what you do is my business

not my personal life you dont have any say in that

are those the only options nothing or forever

but i was young

and didn’t know better

and someone should have told me to capture every second

because now i’m sitting here alone and it’s getting really hard to breath because tears are growing in my throat and they want to break out but there are people

and i just want to be somewhere silent

but still i don’t want to be alone because i’m scared and lonely

and i don’t understand

because i was alone my whole life

my whole life

i was so damn lonely and i was content with that

because i liked myself and my own company

and i didn’t need anyone

but then there was you

so someone should have told me that love is for those few brave who can handle the unbearable emptiness

the unbearable guilt and lack of oneself

because i lost myself to someone i love

and i might get myself back one day

but it will take time it will take time

this is gonna take some time

i wish someone would have told me this

someone should have told me this

its not that i cant live without you its that i dont want to theres a difference we all make choices in life and i choose you

my heart belongs to you and im not asking for it back even if you wont want it anymore im just asking for a chance to have your again i promise ill be more careful with it this time

if a man whistles at you dont turn around you are a lady not a dog

i have loved to the point of madness that which is called madness that which to me is the only sensible way to love

how would your life be different if…you approached all relationships with authenticity and honesty let today be the day…you dedicate yourself to building relationships on the solid foundation of truth and authenticity

don’t fall in love with a woman who reads a woman who feels too much a woman who writes

don’t fall in love with an educated magical delusional crazy woman don’t fall in love with a woman who thinks who knows what she knows and also knows how to fly a woman sure of herself

don’t fall in love with a woman who is interested in politics and is rebellious and feel a huge horror from injustice one who does not like to watch television at all or a woman who is beautiful no matter the features of her face or her body

right now i had everything i could ask for it wasnt a long list but it was a very satisfying one starting with the love of my life back in my arms

right now its hard to imagine that it is raining anywhere in the world

not only did

but i could tell

the universe loved

her too

more than others

she was different

after all i would

be a fool not to

notice the way the

sunshine played with

i think about you every second of every day and i don’t know how to get over you she says

don’t i beg her please don’t get over me

would you like to borrow a pair of my panties to wave around at the next council meeting to get the point across

his eyes flashed got any to spare

i could’ve picked somebody rational but no i had to fall in love with this arrogant idiot come to the keep with me be my princess mourn me when your crazy dad kills me yeah right

a man when he is making up to anybody can be cordial and gallant and full of little attentions and altogether charming but when a man is really in love he cant help looking like a sheep

she soared above the ground and he kept her tethered to the earth without him she would be lost among the clouds

love makes the world go round not at all whiskey makes it go round twice as fast

the ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of the martyr

i love you with a love so great that it simply couldnt keep growing inside my heart but had to leap out and reveal itself in all its magnitude

its okay to love something a little too muchas long as its real to you

youll never be able to let him go youll always feel wrong about being with me

i have no idea what that will mean exactly but im looking forward to finding out with you

what does the brain matter compared with the heart

life is like a game of chess

to win you have to make a move

knowing which move to make comes with insight

and knowledge and by learning the lessons that are

acculated along the way

we become each and every piece within the game called life

gods definition of what matters is pretty straightforward he measures our lives by how we love

under loves heavy burden do i sink

i am almost a hundred years old waiting for the end and thinking about the beginning

there are things i need to tell you but would you listen if i told you how quickly time passes

i know you are unable to imagine this

love is like quicksilver in the hand leave the fingers open and it stays clutch it and it darts away

i would like to be able to breathe— to be able to love her by memory or fidelity but my heart aches i love you continuously intensely

when you decide you want to be with someone forever you want forever to start right now

how lucky am i to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard

because love love is never finished it circles and circles the memories out of order and not always complete

but many of us seek community solely to escape the fear of being alone knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving when we can be alone we can be with others without using them as a means of escape

i am the poet of the poor because i was poor when i loved since i could not give gifts i gave words

this is how the girl who couldnt speak and the man who couldnt see fell in love

i believe the stars align so souls can find one another whether they are meant to be souls in love or souls in life remains to be seen

me quota ang pagibig sa bawat limang umiibig isa lang ang magiging maligaya ang iba iibig sa di sila iniibig iibig nang di natututo o iibig sa wala o di iibig kailanman

people fall in love without reason without even wanting to you cant predict it thats love

the very thought of you

has my legs spread apart

like an easel with a canvas

your greatest awakening comes when you are aware about your infinite nature

the room fell quiet and as i read down the list of over one hundred and fifty eightgrade boys i realized that to me there had only ever been one boy

what i feel for you can’t be conveyed in phrasal combinations it either screams out loud or stays painfully silent but i promise — it beats words it beats worlds

loving you forever cant be wrong even though youre not here cant move on

just for the record she still loves you she wouldnt bother to torture you if she didnt

you can love somebody without it being like that you keep them a stranger a stranger whos a friend

i asked you here tonight because when you realise you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible

i made such a fool of myself she lamented

love does not make you a fool

he didn’t love me back

that does not make you a fool either

just tell me … her voice cracked when does it stop hurting

the quiet world

in an effort to get people to look

into each other’s eyes more

and also to appease the mutes

the government has decided

to allot each person exactly one hundred

and sixtyseven words per day

when the phone rings i put it to my ear

without saying hello in the restaurant

i am adjusting well to the new way

late at night i call my long distance lover

proudly say i only used fiftynine today

i saved the rest for you

when she doesn’t respond

i know she’s used up all her words

so i slowly whisper i love you

thirtytwo and a third times

after that we just sit on the line

and listen to each other breathe

the most introspective of souls are often those that have been hurt the most

my lifemy whole life take it and do with it what you will i love youlove you as i have never loved any living thing from the moment i met you i loved you loved you blindly adoringlymadly

you didnt know it thenyou know it now

the purpose of relationship is not to have another who might complete you but to have another with whom you might share your completeness

love doesnt give you very many choices when you love someone you just want to be with them if they break your heart you will still love them because hearts are easy to break and though love is tender and sometimes fragile love isnt

love addicts you to its feeling you never ever want to lose that feeling sometimes the fear of losing love drives people to do crazy things like buy a plane ticket make a phone call run out of a class cry write laugh

because when you love someone you really love them you give them your whole heart you trust them you never want to be away from them sometimes you dont even need their words you just need them there

love is such an amazing thing and too many people take it for granted if youre in love dont let it go dont you dare let it go

buy a gift for a dog and youll be amazed at the way it will dance and swerve its tail but if dont have anything to offer to it it wont even recognize your arrival such are the attributes of fake friends

he said that we belonged together because he was born with a flower and i was born with a butterfly and that flowers and butterflies need each other for survival

that must be love when everything else in the world could implode and you wouldnt care as long as you had that one person standing beside you

there was nowhere i could go that wouldnt be you

her existence alone was excuse enough to justify the creation of the entire world

ill always want him until every sun goes dark in every sky until i am nothing more than longforgotten cosmic dust i will want him and even then i suspect my particles will long for his

there is no perfection only beautiful versions of brokenness

my mother used to tell me that when push comes to shove you always know who to turn to that being a family isnt a social construct but an instinct

time expands then contracts all in tune with the stirrings of the heart

and lovers cannot see

the pretty follies

that themselves commit

i hold the bottle out into the rain and watch as the steady flow slowly fills it when there is enough enough that beth can clearly see i close the bottle and hand it to her

she raises a skeptical eyebrow but accepts the bottle

its our rain beth

her head barely shakes to show her confusion while i rub the back of my neck and search for my courage i told you i loved you in this rain and when you doubt my words i want you to look at this bottle

i wish the dayd begin

i wish it would rain or snow

or the wind would blow

or the grass would grow

i wish i had yesterday

i wish there were games to play

love is like a good cake you never know when its coming but youd better eat it when it does

she wanted to lose herself in him to tie his arms around her like a tourniquet

if she showed him how much she needed him hed run away

i understood that as much as i had resisted the outside as much as i had constricted my life as much as i had closed and narrowed the channels into me there were still many takers for the quiet heart

i wanted to see the place where margaret grew to what she is even at the worst time of all when i had no hope of ever calling her mine

i dont want to live i want to love first and live incidentally

love is like the sea its a moving thing but still and all it takes its shape from the shore it meets and its different with every shore

mysteries of attraction could not always be explained through logic sometimes the fractures in two separate souls became the very hinges that held them together

when i like people immensely i never tell their names to anyone it is like surrendering a part of them i have grown to love secrecy

your memory feels like home to me

so whenever my mind wanders it always finds it’s way back to you

perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved that is we demand something love from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demandfree and asking for nothing but his company

sometimes i think gravity may be death in disguise other times i think gravity is love which is why loves only demand is that we fall

you want to take me to a movie i asked

well not really he said what i really want is for you to be my girlfriend but i thought saying that might scare you off

i loved him as we always love for the first time with idolatry and wild passion

what am i supposed to call you

your royal husbandness its required by law im afraid

the spiritualization of sensuality is called love it is a great triumph over christianity

ill come and make love to you at five oclock if im late start without me

it’s too bad if a heart lacks fire

and is deprived of the light

the day on which you are

is the most wasted day of your life

images flashed through his mind he saw nico and his sister on a snowy cliff in maine percy jackson protecting them from a manticore percys sword gleamed in the dark hed been the first demigod nico had ever seen in action

will she whispered say something will

but there was nothing to say there was only emptiness as there had been before her as there would always be

i have lost everything will thought everything

i’m not scared

of the monsters

my bed

i’m much more scared

of the boys

with messy brown hair

that only know

how to form

sometimes remembering hurts too much

his breathing was ragged beg to differ mercer

you carried my heart in your hands tonight he said but i have felt as if you carried it long before that

some things are better left in the past and true things are destined to repeat themselves

i’ve been working hard to become the kind of man she needs the kind of man she already believes me to be

i gave you my heart but it wasnt enough

all any of us wanted really was to know that we counted that someone elses life would not have been as rich without us here

thank youfor gracing my life with your lovely presence for adding the sweet measure of your soul to my existence

the world is not a pleasant place to be without someone to hold and be held by

i realized i’m in love its always been right in front of me

the thing is that world doesnt exist all growing up means is that your realize no one will come along to fix things no one will come along to save you

god our knees touching isnt enough i need more

shes knotting her fingers together on her lap as if she doesnt know what to do with them i want to touch her but what if she pulls away like before ive never been such a wuss with a girl in my life

i bite my bottom lip as i slide my hand about millionth of a millimeter closer to her hand

she doesnt seem fazed so i move closer and closer

when the tips of my fingers touch her wrist she freezes but she doesnt jerk her hand away god her skin is so soft i think as my fingers trail a path from her wrist to her knuckles to her smooth manicured nails

with a slight shift of my hand i lace my fingers through hers

im holding hands with maggie armstrong

the bus stops suddenly and i look out the window its our stop she must have realized this because she pulls her hand away from mine and stands i follow behind still reeling

i don’t understand the hatred and fear of gays and bisexuals and lesbians…

it’s a concept i honestly cannot grasp to me it’s not who you love…

a man a woman what have you…

it’s the fact that you love that is all that truly matters

i canti cant think about anything or anyone else he whispered a hand drifted up dragging back through his hair i cant think straight when youre around i cant sleep it feels like i cant breathei just

liam please i begged youre tired youre barely over being sick lets just can we just go back to the others

i love you he turned toward me that agonized expression still on his face i love you every second of everyday and i dont understand why or how to make it stop

he looked wild with pain it pinned me in place even before what he had said registered in my mind

i know its wrong i know it down to my damn bones and i feel like im sick im trying to be a good person but i cant i cant do this anymore

love is not something you protect it’s something you risk

what we all want really is to be loved that craving drives our worst behavior

the bottom line is that we never fall for the person were supposed to

if in thirst you drink water from a cup you see god in it those who are not in love with god will see only their own faces in it

without dreams i have to be content with my own imagination– which is almost as good i can picture all of those things perfectly as well as how itll be when i take your life from this world

friends ask you questions enemies question you

love was the most savage monster of all

you left with my soul in your fists and my heart in your teeth and i don’t want either of them back ben

its a very brave thing to fall in love you have to be willing to trust somebody else with your whole being and thats very difficult really difficult and very brave

youre a dream like everything else

you know i love you right the urge to kiss her goodbye was so strong that i almost broke our rules

she smiled beautiful and golden in the late morning light not as much as i love you

oh man this is my dream come true having an ‘i love you more’ debate here i’ll start i love you more your turn

sydney laughed and opened the door i’ve taken debate classes you’d lose to my logic

you seem to think you have a choice cam said but you have it backwards love chooses you the shadow moves as the sun commands

but i leave myself in your hands what choice do i have by the time you read this last page that if anywhere is the only place i will be

does that count as an argument can we kiss and make up now

it was only half an argument

fine then you kiss and i’ll make up

i laughed until he effectively shut me up with his lips

i think  i should go home soon mom and luke are probably going nuts what about you

he shrugged a casual lift of one shoulder you tell me when i left nevernever i didnt have any plans other than being with you if you want me around just say the word

it always struck me in years after how bizarre it was how two people could look at one another with such tenderness and complete love and how quickly that could dissolve into nothing but bitterness

live simply deepest joy is like a flowerbeautiful in essence

okay then i’ll just say i love you there is nothing in this world more important to me than you are i’m only content when you’re near my whole purpose is to be what you need me to be it’s not poetry but it’s from my heart will that do

lies can sound awfully pretty when a girl is in love with the person telling them

its easy to cry when you realize that everyone you love will reject you or die

i reserve the right to love many different people at once and to change my prince often

i cut myself because you wouldnt let me cry

i cried because you wouldnt let me speak

i spoke because you wouldnt let me shine

i shone because i thought you loved me

a man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a womans love however badly he may have treated her

adults are the death of hope

voicemail  hi isabel culpeper i am lying in my bed looking at the ceiling i am mostly naked i am thinking of … your mother call me

voicemail  the first minute and thirty seconds of i’ve gotta get a message to you by the bee gees

voicemail  hotel california by the eagles in its entirety with every instance of the word california replaced with minnesota

voicemail  i wish you’d answer

it hurts to love its like giving yourself to be flayed and knowing that at any moment the other person may just walk off with your skin

love and you shall be loved

you may only call me mrs darcy when you are completely and perfectly and incandescently happy

some people feel love in their hearts julie some of us feel it all way into our souls were the ones who cant forget

i look at you and i think about you and  i dont know no one has ever confounded me the way you do

the opposite of love is not hate it is indifference

in love there are two things  bodies and words

they do make love stories for girls with black hearts after all they go like this

choice or no my heart is his

she blushed and so did he she greeted him in a faltering voice and he spoke to her without knowing what he was saying

two seconds later the sound of an alarm filled my ears

what did you do i said over the noise as he backed up towards the bathroom door

the girl who gave you the note

i caught her staring at my lighter

i blinked you gave a child in a psych ward  a lighter

his eyes crinkled at the corners she seemed trustworthy

youre sick i said but smiled

hey nobodys perfect  noah smiled back

i want him to love me as much as i love him

there’s always that one guy who gets a hold on you not like your best friend’s brother who gets you in a headlock kind of hold or the little kid you’re babysitting who attaches himself to your leg kind of hold

gilbert im afraid im scandalously in love with you

oh dont mind me came an extremely sarcastic voice near the wall you two go ahead and make out–ill just sit here and bleed quietly

love doesn’t have to be on valentine’s day it doesn’t have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirtythree or fiftynine it doesn’t have to conform to whatever is usual it doesn’t have to be kismet at once or rhapsody by the third day

it just has to be in time in place in spirt

it just has to be

love is proved the moment you let go of someone because they need you to

he wanted to take his love back from her so badly the old techniques didn’t work anymore in fact they’d never worked how do you stop loving someone it was one of the world’s more brutal mysteries the more you tried the less it worked

she knew whose love she doubted it wasnt her parents and it wasnt her friends it was her own

not like this he wanted it to be real

if you listen to the wind very carefully youll be able to hear me whisper my love for you

those mornings when we kiss and surrender for an hour before we say a single word

please he says im begging you to stop

i cant stomach your pain he says i can feel it so strongly and its making me crazy please he says to me dont be sad or hurt or guilty youve done nothing wrong

im sorry

dont be sorry either he says god the only reason im not going to kill kent for this is because i know it would only upset you more

i could still smell her on my fur it clung to me a memory of another world

i was drunk with it with the scent of her id got too close

the smell of summer on her skin the halfrecalled cadence of her voice the sensation of her fingers on my fur every bit of me sang with the memory of her closeness

too close

i couldnt stay away

better to put your heart on the line risk everything and walk away with nothing than play it safe love is a lot of things but safe isn’t one of them

he shook his head just looking at me

what i asked

nothing he said

why are you looking at me like that

i kind of scoffed or sighed or exhaled in a way that was vaguely coughy and then said im not beau

you are like a millennial natalie portman like v for vendetta natalie portman

never seen it

really he asked pixiehaired gorgeous girl dislikes authority and cant help but fall for a boy she knows is trouble its your autobiography so far as i can tell

his every syllable flirted honestly he kind of turned me on i didnt even know that guys could turn me on  not like in real life

love that moves the sun and the other stars

i just dont see why the past has to matter

but these things don’t matter at all because once you are real you can’t be ugly except to people who don’t understand

so many believe that it is love that grows but it is the knowing that grows and love simply expands to contain it

take it from me love has all the lasting permanence of a rainbow beautiful while its there and just as likely to have disappeared by the time you blink

i want my world to start and end with you

falling into ruin was a bit like falling in love both descents stripped you bare and left you as you were at your core and both endings are equally painful

love is blind they saybut isnt it more that love makes us see too much isnt it more that love floods our brain with sights and sounds so that everything looks bigger brighter more lovely than ever before

kitten your hands are heaven and your eyes are my home

he is both the source of my happiness and the one i want to share it with

she was eighteen she was the most beautiful woman in a hundred years she didn’t seem to care

‘you’re all right’ her mother asked

buttercup sipped her cocoa ‘fine’ she said

‘you’re sure’ her father wondered

‘yes’ buttercup replied there was a very long pause ‘but i must never love again’

she never did

he didnt mind how he looked to other people because the nursery magic had made him real and when you are real shabbiness doesnt matter

elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could you begin said she

this goes to show you that sometimes the unseen is not to be feared and that those meant to love us most are not always ones who do

i could feel the warmth of his presence as if a soft blanket had been wrapped around my soul around my heart it held me and protected me it sheltered me and i knew i wasn’t alone anymore

sometimes i shrink from your knowing what i have felt for you and sometimes i am distressed that all of it you will never know

if you cannot hold me in your arms then hold my memory in high regard

and if i cannot be in your life then at least let me live in your heart

if you have two parents who love you you have won lifes lotto

if you do not have parents or if the parents you have are so broken and so frankly terrible that they are no improvement over nothing this is fine

its not ideal because its harder without adults who love you more than they love themselves but harder is just harder thats all

to me you are a work of art and i would give you my heart  thats if i had one

and he

it is better to have an enemy who will fight you in an open field then a lover who will kill you in your sleep

you have a beautiful laugh like the promise of tomorrow

sometimes you have to learn to love whats good for you

faith goes up the stairs that love has built and looks out the windows which hope has opened

i wanted movement and not a calm course of existence i wanted excitement and danger and the chance to sacrifice myself for my love

a gentleman holds my hand

a man pulls my hair

a soulmate will do both

i will love you even when i am dust on the wind

it isnt about love vee said its about fun

thank you creator of the universe for the gift of life you have given me

thank you for giving me everything that i have ever needed

thank you for the opportunity to experience this beautiful body and this wonderful mind

thank you for living inside me with all your love and your pure and boundless spirit

with your warm and radiating light

thank you for using my words for using my eyes for using my heart to share your love wherever i go

i love you just the way you are and because i am your creation i love myself just the way i am

help me to keep the love and the peace in my heart and to make that love a new way of life that i may live in love the rest of my life

dont be afraid to lose him because if a man truly loves you hes not going anywhere

you dont have to say i love you to say i love you you said with a shrug all you have to do is say my name and i know

cant you hear it you said when you love someone you say their name different like its safe inside your mouth

what are you wishing for grace interrupted to kiss you i said to her

he is the cheese to my macaroni

dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman that his love has an earlier death

think of it we could have gone on longing for one another and pretending not to notice forever this obsession with dignity can ruin your life if you let it

i’m sort of… coming off a bad relationship

when did it end

slightly before it started

love is born into every human being it calls back the halves of our original nature together it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature

you have within youright noweverything you need to deal with whatever the world can throw at you

she writes things with her movements that i for the life of me could never write with a pen

i want you i want you so badly i can’t stand it when you left it felt like the world got darker like i couldn’t truly see anything couldn’t feel anything

love will come

and when love comes

love will hold you

love will call your name

and you will melt

love will hurt you but

love will never mean to

love will play no games

has been hard enough already

falling in love is like owning a dog

throw things away and love will bring them back

again and again and again

but most of all love needs love lots of it

and in return love loves you and never stops

you and i

we had no ending

no said goodbye

for all my life

ill wonder why

she had never imagined she had the power to make someone else so happy and not a magical power eithera purely human one

it is love not reason that is stronger than death

i’m not a warrior or a goddess i said at last

adrian leaned closer as far as i’m concerned you’re both

i remember when your name was just another name that rolled without thought off my tongue

now i can’t look at your name without an abundance of sentiment attached to each letter

your name which i played with so carelessly so easily has somehow become sacred to my lips

a name i won’t throw around lightheartedly or repeat without deep thought

and if ever i speak of you i use the english language to describe who you were to me you are nameless because those letters grouped together in that familiar form… carries too much meaning for my capricious heart

the only difference between falling in love and being in love is that your heart already knows how you feel but your mind is too stubborn to admit it

to love someone enough to let them go you had to let them go forever or you did not love them that much

and you drink a little too much and try a little too hard and you go home to a cold bed and think that was fine and your life is a long line of fine

love it was the beginning and end of everything the foundation and the ceiling and the air in between

the magic that occurs

when you give a person

to just be themselves

you can give without loving but you can never love without giving

love is happiness but only when you believe it will last forever even though every time it turns out to be a lie it’s only faith that gives love its strength and its joy

simon so were you following me or is it just an amazing coincidence that you happened to be on the roof of a building i was walking by when i got attacked

jace i was following you

simon is this the part where you tell me youre secretly in love with me

you are at once both the quiet and the confusion of my heart imagine my heartbeat when you are in this state

when what you want is a relationship and not a person get a dog

love can rebuild the world they say so everythings possible when it comes to love

there was a man who loved the moon but whenever he tried to embrace her she broke into a thousand pieces and left him drenched with empty arms

soulmate is an overused term but a true soul connection is very rare and very real

it made me think of isabel back at her house we didnt have what sam and grace had we werent even close to having it i didnt think what we had could get to this even if you gave it a thousand years

i wanted to tell her that i loved her and not in the complicated way i loved our parents but in a simple way i never had to think about i loved her like breathing

ah me but where are now the songs i sang

when life was sweet because you call’d them sweet

love is not an emotion it is your very existence

i dont understand how i can know so little about love and how it works how i can be so bad at it when its all ive ever wanted

all ive ever known is about leaving or being left

i give her the only honest and true answer i have

youre where i want to be

life is like a sandwich

birth as one slice

and death as the other

what you put inbetween

the slices is up to you

is your sandwich tasty or sour

then you look at her and smile a smile your dissembling face will remember until the day you die baby you say baby this is part of my novel

this is how you lose her

i think sometimes when we find love we pretend it away or ignore it or tell ourselves we’re imagining it because it is the most painful kind of hope there is

dustfinger still clearly remembered the feeling of being in love for the first time how vulnerable his heart had suddenly been such a trembling quivering thing happy and miserably unhappy at once

soul connections are not often found and are worth every bit of fight left in you to keep

and besides    i don’t want to leave you er you guys

he smiled and it lit up his whole face well ‘we’ are certainly happy to hear that oh and i’m also happy to watch our darling little love child dragon while you’re in st louis

if he cant handle you at your worst then he does not deserve you at your best real love means seeing beyond the words spoken out of pain and instead seeing a persons soul

true love always makes a man better no matter what woman inspires it

i think it’s beautiful

the way you sparkle

when you talk about

the things you love

and think not you can direct the course of love for love if it finds you worthy directs your course

—i dont want to lose you

—then why are you the one that keeps letting go

he didnt realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark

he looked at her as a man might look at a faded flower he had plucked in which it was difficult for him to trace the beauty that had made him pick and so destroy it

that’s a silly question the one with the dirty face of course’

no the one with the dirty face will look at the other man and assume that he looks like him and vice versa the man with the clean face will see his colleague covered in grime and say to himself i must be dirty too i’d better have a wash’

what are you trying to say’

do you think we can be friends i asked

he stared up at the ceiling probably not but we can pretend

the heart makes its choices without weighing the consequences it doesnt look ahead to the lonely nights that follow

i met a boy whose eyes showed me that the past present and future were all the same thing

the cord pulled taut and she rebounded flying back up before falling again as her velocity slowed she opened her eyes and found herself dangling at the end of the cord about five feet above jace he was grinning

nice he said as graceful as a falling snowflake

was i screaming she asked genuinely curious you know on the way down

he nodded thankfully no ones home or they would have assumed i was murdering you

ha you cant even reach me she kicked out a leg and spun lazily in midair

jaces eyes glinted want to bet

clary knew that expression no she said quickly whatever youre going to do

now he said that was much better you didnt scream at all

i didnt get the chance she was breathless and not just from the impact of the fall being sprawled on top of jace feeling his body against hers made her hands shake and her heart beat faster

unwinged and naked sorrow surrenders its crown to a throne called grace

i know what my heart is like

since your love died

it is like a hollow ledge

left there by the tide

drying inward from the edge

darkness may hide the trees

and the flowers from the eyes

but it cannot hide

love from the soul

kisses open doors ive noticed that one gesture can unlock secrets ease open feelings it cant be preventedthese kisses just are its how they work they break into basements you never knew you had

what’s wrong is that every morning and every night i lie in bed wondering why you’re not beside me

i’ll be there wherever you want‘there’ to be

curran to kate

in love the other is important in lust you are important

i know love is fragile and loving someone like you is near impossible like holding something shattered through a raging sandstorm if you want her to love you shelter her from that storm…and make certain that storm isn’t you

falling in love was like falling off a cliff it felt pretty much like flying until you hit the ground

we all know interspecies romance is weird

i shouldnt have to be a liar to make someone love me i shouldnt be so afraid of losing someone that ill do anything to make them stay

love is a force unto itself sayyidi for love people consider the unthinkableand often achieve the impossible i would not sneer at its power

and i got out of there without punching anyone kicking anyone or breaking down in tears some days the small victories are all you achieve

he didnt marry you to become king he became king because he wanted to marry you

then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him beforeand it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky she was the only real thing in the world

you promised seaweed brain we would not get separated ever again

you’re impossible

love you too

no human should mislead another by promising them something they know to be untrue

the supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves—say rather loved in spite of ourselves

set the standard stop expecting others to show you love acceptance commitment  respect when you dont even show that to yourself

three years thats a thousand tomorrows maam

i must try to see the difference between my picture of a person and his behavior as it is narcissistically distorted and the persons reality as it exists regardless of my interests needs and fears

i love him wholly and unconditionally and without reservation i love him enough to sacrifice a friendship i love him enough to accept my own happiness and use it in turn to make him happy back

i don’t want to be your first fallon i want to be your last

i am the least difficult of men all i want is boundless love

i dont look for love love looks for me why because it needs me because im not afraid of it

too many adults wish to protect teenagers when they should be stimulating them to read of life as it is lived

the worst thing he told me

is bitterness people end up so

it was a beautiful night

thats completely asinine

the truth is that adults love in different ways not the only way

only you only you are love

there is a love i reminisce

ive never sown

or lips that im yet to kiss

and eyes

not met my own

hands that wrap around my wrists

and arms

that feel like home

i wonder how it is i miss

these things

ive never known

perhaps people like us cannot love ordinary people can  that is their secret

everything happens for a reason and something better will come along for me

love is bullshit emotion is bullshit i am a rock a jerk im an uncaring asshole and proud of it

mine was the twilight and the morning mine was a world of rooftops and love songs

i know what i have given you

i do not know what you have received

we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love

the only sea i saw was the seesaw sea with you riding on it lie down lie easy let me shipwreck in your thighs

i have loved in life and i have been loved

i have drunk the bowl of poison from the hands of love as nectar

and have been raised above lifes joy and sorrow

my heart aflame in love set afire every heart that came in touch with it

my heart has been rent and joined again

my heart has been broken and again made whole

my heart has been wounded and healed again

a thousand deaths my heart has died and thanks be to love it lives yet

i went through hell and saw there loves raging fire

and i entered heaven illumined with the light of love

i wept in love and made all weep with me

i mourned in love and pierced the hearts of men

and when my fiery glance fell on the rocks the rocks burst forth as volcanoes

the whole world sank in the flood caused by my one tear

with my deep sigh the earth trembled and when i cried aloud the name of my beloved

i shook the throne of god in heaven

i bowed my head low in humility and on my knees i begged of love

disclose to me i pray thee o love thy secret

she took me gently by my arms and lifted me above the earth and spoke softly in my ear

my dear one thou thyself art love art lover

and thyself art the beloved whom thou hast adored

sometimes i think my whole life has been about holding on to you

don’t marry him don’t be with him be with me

i want your most vital organ i want it to be mine

i guess the sacrifice of my dignity is the only thing that will save us now the things i endure for love the fates laugh at my torment

love moderately long love doth so

too swift arrives as tardy as too slow

love each other in moderation that is the key to longlasting love too fast is as bad as too slow

what made me run away was doubtless not so much the fear of settling down but of settling down permanently in something ugly

i am larger better than i thought i did not know i held so much goodness

all seems beautiful to me

whoever denies me it shall not trouble me

whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me

i dont care said seth i would have done it i would have sold my soul for you you and mei told you somethings always going to keep us near each othereven if we arent together

you see there are some people that one loves and others that perhaps one would rather be with

no one has imagined us we want to live like trees

sycamores blazing through the sulfuric air

dappled with scars still exuberantly budding

our animal passion rooted in the city

the surest way to hurt yourself is to give up on love just because it didn’t

work out the first time

in the shadow my father has cast over my entire life you are the only light i can see anymore and whatever the cost i refuse to let that light be extinguished

so shut up live travel adventure bless and dont be sorry

katniss i’m coming back into focus when caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home

peeta gives an unconvincing shake of head

caesar handsome lad like you there must be some special girl come on what’s her name

peeta well there is this one girl i’ve had a crush on her ever since i can remember but i’m pretty sure she didn’t know i was alive until the reaping

caesar she have another fellow

peeta i don’t know but a lot of boys like her

caesar so here’s what you do you win you go home she can’t turn you down eh

peeta i don’t think it’s going to work out winning… won’t help in my case

caesar why ever not

peeta because… because… she came here with me

caesar oh that is a piece of bad luck

peeta it’s not good

caesar well i don’t think any of us can blame you it’d be hard not to fall for that young lady she didn’t know

peeta not until now

the trick  is to find the balance between the bright colors of humor and the serious issues of identity selfloathing and the possibility for intimacy and love when it seems no longer possible or sadder yet no longer necessary

life is fragile and temporary the faces of today quickly become the faces of the past sorrow pain and anger it all fades

except love love is forever and there after even when weve fallen to our graves

give me the waters of lethe that numb the heart if they exist i will still not have the power to forget you

id sell my soul to have you in my whole life youll always be what i wanted most

never stop smiling not even when youre sad someone might fall in love with your smile

he who is in love is wise and is becoming wiser sees newly every time he looks at the object beloved drawing from it with his eyes and his mind those virtues which it possesses

she had a wild wandering soul

but when she loved she loved with chaos and that made all the difference

sweet talker i scoffed you didn’t know anything about me the first time we met

i knew you were beautiful he said i just hoped for the rest

you are my whole heart scarlet and this is breaking it

my heart cracked open and clear dropped out of me my mouth opened and i looked round me and stamped my foot does this look like a good time to tell me that you damn stupid boy i meant to sound mean but my voice wobbled now

he gave a little smile my foulmouthed warrior

how far have you walked for men who’ve never held your feet in their laps

kids chase the love that eludes them

do you ever just put your arms out and just spin and spin and spin well thats what love is like everything inside of you tells you to stop before you fall but for some reason you just keep going

it is easy to hate and it is difficult to love this is how the whole scheme of things works all good things are difficult to achieve and bad things are very easy to get

we love men because they can never fake orgasms even if they wanted to

because they write poems songs and books in our honor

because they never understand us but they never give up

because they can see beauty in women when women have long ceased to see any beauty in themselves

because they come from little boys

because they can churn out long intricate machiavellian or incredibly complex mathematics and physics equations but they can be comparably clueless when it comes to women

because they are incredible lovers and never rest until we’re happy

because they elevate sports to religion

because they’re never afraid of the dark

because they don’t care how they look or if they age

because they persevere in making and repairing things beyond their abilities with the naïve selfassurance of the teenage boy who knew everything

because they never wear or dream of wearing high heels

because they’re always ready for sex

because they’re like pomegranates lots of inedible parts but the juicy seeds are incredibly tasty and succulent and usually exceed your expectations

because they’re afraid to go bald

because you always know what they think and they always mean what they say

because they love machines tools and implements with the same ferocity women love jewelry

because they go to great lengths to hide unsuccessfully that they are frail and human

because they either speak too much or not at all to that end

because they always finish the food on their plate

because they are brave in front of insects and mice

because a wellspoken fouryear old girl can reduce them to silence and a beautiful year old can reduce them to slobbering idiots

because they want to be either omnivorous or ascetic warriors or lovers artists or generals but nothing inbetween

because for them there’s no such thing as too much adrenaline

because when all is said and done they can’t live without us no matter how hard they try

because they’re truly as simple as they claim to be

because they love extremes and when they go to extremes we’re there to catch them

because they are tender they when they cry and how seldom they do it

because what they lack in talk they tend to make up for in action

because they make excellent companions when driving through rough neighborhoods or walking past dark alleys

because they really love their moms and they remind us of our dads

because they never care what their horoscope their motherinlaw nor the neighbors say

because they don’t lie about their age their weight or their clothing size

because they have an uncanny ability to look deeply into our eyes and connect with our heart even when we don’t want them to

because when we say i love you they ask for an explanation

most people are slow to champion love because they fear the transformation it brings into their lives and make no mistake about it love does take over and transform the schemes and operations of our egos in a very mighty way

why me she asked holding on to him

if its ka itll come like a wind and your plans will stand before it no more than a barn before a cyclone

what made you fall in love with a prostitute

i didn’t understand it myself at the time but i’ve thought about it since and i think it was because knowing that your body would never be mine alone i had to concentrate on conquering your soul

marriage must fight constantly against a monster which devours everything routine

nico studied his face – his seagreen eyes his grin his ruffled black hair somehow percy jackson seemed like a regular guy now not a mythical figure not someone to idolize or crush on

you are my more

my love my life

love brings to light a lovers noble and hidden qualitieshis rare and exceptional traits it is thus liable to be deceptive of his normal qualities

he gripped her hard forcing her to meet his eyes as he snarled i see you i see every part of you and i am not afraid

i will not be afraid

a line in the burning brightness

my name is aelin ashryver galathynius

and i will not be afraid

fall in love with someone

who tastes like adventure

but looks like

the calm beautiful morning

after a terrible storm

i dont believe it quince says with absolute certainty  i dont believe anything magical can make someone more in love  he looks me right in the eye as he says love is already the strongest magic in the world

look i said we knew jason and becky would be back the break would end this isnt a surprise its whats supposed to happen its what we wanted right

is it he asked is it what you want

he loved her he loved her and until hed loved her she had never minded being alone

there is only one happiness in life to love and be loved

it’s all about falling in love with yourself and sharing that love with someone who appreciates you rather than looking for love to compensate for a self love deficit

now that he brought it up i did recall saying that great betrayed by my own immorality

god bonessome of that was depraved

ill take that as a compliment he closed the distance between usi love you dont be ashamed of anything we did even if your prudery is on life support

your love should never be offered to the mouth of a stranger  only to someone who has the valor and daring to cut pieces of their soul off with a knife  then weave them into a blanket to protect you

if you love something let it go if it comes back its yours

rosie hmmm good point what are the s for

ruby fixing what you fucked up in your s

rosie great looking forward to it

human existence is so fragile a thing and exposed to such dangers that i cannot love without trembling

if there is such a thing as a good marriage it is because it resembles friendship rather than love

i believe that lovenot imitationis the sincerest form of flattery your imitator thinks that you can be duplicated your lover knows you cant

borges said there are only four stories to tell a love story between two people a love story between three people the struggle for power and the voyage all of us writers rewrite these same stories ad infinitum

no you sick stupid creep i love you i shouldnt i shouldnt youre sick inside caine sick but i love you

whenever you are ready or if you never are my heart is yours until death do us part whatever that may mean when consorting with one of death’s handmaidens

i prayed for all his dreams to come true i prayed that i would always be able to connect with himeven if i was no longer on earth

real love finds you once if youre lucky

in the vastness of space and the immensity of time it is my joy to share a planet and an epoch with annie

dedication to sagans wife ann druyan in cosmos

just because you love someone doesnt mean you have to be involved with them love is not a bandage to cover wounds

love is an engraved invitation to grief

im afraid theyre in love he said concerned they dont want to leave you he lifted one hand from her waist to gently brush a pair from her neck where their wings fanned against her jaw melancholy he said i know just how they feel

i have come to the conclusion never again to think of marrying and for this reason i can never be satisfied with anyone who would be blockhead enough to have me

grief is like the ocean it comes on waves ebbing and flowing sometimes the water is calm and sometimes it is overwhelming all we can do is learn to swim

one of the most important things you can do on this earth is to let people know they are not alone

maybe you expected marriage to be perfect  i guess thats where you and i are different see i thought it would be all about making mistakes but doing it with someone whos there to remind you what you learned along the way

here are the things i want for you

i want you to be happy i want someone else to know the warmth of your smile to feel the way i did when i was in your presence

i want you to remember my lips beneath your fingers and how you told me things you never told another soul i want you to know that i have kept sacred everything you had entrusted in me and i always will

finally i want you to know how sorry i am for pushing you away when i had only meant to bring you closer and if i ever felt like home to you it was because you were safe with me  i want you to know that most of all

sometimes you know in your heart you love someone but you have to go away before your head can figure it out

you dont need another human being to make your life complete but lets be honest having your wounds kissed by someone who doesnt see them as disasters in your soul but cracks to put their love into is the most calming thing in this world

you know i love you right

i know he breathed his arm tightening automatically around my waist you know how much i wish it was enough

lift your hips for me love

i love you i thought but i didn’t say it it was not that i feared she would laugh in my face she was far too kind for that my fear was a greater one— that she won’t say it back

tomas did not realize at the time that metaphors are dangerous metaphors are not to be trifled with a single metaphor can give birth to love

doubt thou the stars are fire

doubt that the sun doth move

doubt truth to be a liar

but never doubt i love

time is how you spend your love

when love beckons to you follow him

though his ways are hard and steep

and when his wings enfold you yield to him

though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you

and when he speaks to you believe in him

though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden

but if in your fear you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure

then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of

love’s threshingfloor

into the seasonless world where you shall laugh but not all of your laughter

and weep but not all of your tears

but if you love and must needs have desires let these be your desires

to melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night

to know the pain of too much tenderness

to be wounded by your own understanding of love

and to bleed willingly and joyfully

she gave a little gasp if you love me all so much why are you still dressed she whispered you know nothing jon snow nothoh oh ohhh

afterward she was almost shy or as shy as ygritte ever got the thing you did she said when they lay together on their piled clothes with yourmouth she hesistated is thatis it what lordss do to their ladies down in the south

i dont think so no one had ever told jon just what lords did with their ladies i onlywanted to kiss you there thats all you seemed to like it

aye ii liked it some no one taught you such

theres been no one he confessed only you

having an eye for beauty isnt the same thing as a weaknessexcept possibly when it comes to you

i never wanted to have anything in my life that i couldnt stand losing but its too late for that

i can hate you more but ill never love you less

you know he said under normal circumstances you inviting me to the bedroom would be the highlight of my day

i crossed my arms and sat on the bed i did so out of simple fatigue but a moment later i was struck by what i was doing this is where adrian sleeps im touching the covers hes wrapped in every night what does he wear does he wear anything

i jumped up

i never understood how men could remember all those details about sports but yet were incapable of remembering where they set their car keys or wallet

fear can’t be reasoned with neither can hate they’re like love they’re almost identical emotions that’s why ares and aphrodite like each other their twin sons – fear and panic – were spawned from both war and love

my lover asks me

what is the difference between me and the sky

the difference my love

is that when you laugh

i forget about the sky

love too has to be learned

falling in love should be the easiest thing in the world but its not

its delicious to have people adore you but its exhausting too particularly when your own feelings dont match theirs

i wished it was raining he said

i dont need the rain i said i need you

you are enough to drive a saint to madness or a king to his knees

you think im pretty

without any makeup on

you think im funny

when i tell the puch line wrong

i know you get me

so ill let my walls come down down

yes st claire i like you but i cant say it aloud because hes my friend and friends dont let other friends make drunken declarations and expect them to act upon them the next day

the most difficult aspect of moving on is accepting that the other person already did

what you are to do without me i cannot imagine

the strategic adversary is fascism the fascism in us all in our heads and in our everyday behavior the fascism that causes us to love power to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us

i loved you long before you loved me its the only thing i have you beat at and ill bring it up every chance i get

i sighed softly she was absolutely right

im with you no matter what else you have in your head im with you and i love you

when you really love someone you see all their mess and their brokenness and you love them anyway in fact seeing all of that sort of makes you love them more

i miss everything about you

cant believe that i still want you

and after all the things weve been through

in god there is no hunger that needs to be filled only plenteousness that desires to give

hes just a boy said luke aleches not perfect and youre not fallen

were all fallen said magnus and he wrapped himself up in his chains and was silent

love is on every side and no ones side dont ask what love can do for you

you know the memories he whispered turning toward the crib

the newchild stirred slightly in his sleep jonas looked over at him

there could be love jonas whispered

the opposite of loneliness is not togetherness  its intimacy

to me you were more than just a person you were a place where i finally felt at home

i want you to want me because you want me not because of grief not because he is not here i want you to love me for me i want you to kiss me first and not because you need me to help you but because you need to kiss me

you and i its as though we have been taught to kiss in heaven and sent down to earth together to see if we know what we were taught

peter will love lara jean with all his heart always

love is making friends with fear because fear is the constant companion of intimacy  and when you bring fear out of the darkness and into the light you realize it was an illusion based on our own insecurities

i would kiss you in the middle of the ocean during a lightning storm cuz id rather be left for﻿ dead than wondering what thunder sounds like

love has no limitations it cannot be measured it has no boundaries although many have tried love is indefinable

we are at our most powerful the moment we no longer need to be powerful

i don’t love you as if you were the saltrose topaz

or arrow of carnations that propagate fire

i love you as certain dark things are loved

secretly between the shadow and the soul

some people are born with tornadoes in their lives but constellations in their eyes other people are born with stars at their feet but their souls are lost at sea

becausebecauseshe came here with me

love is never supposed to hurt love is supposed to heal to be your haven from misery to make living fucking worthwhile

we can live without religion and meditation but we cannot survive without human affection

sometimes that mountain youve been climbing is just a grain of sand and what youve been up there searching for forever is in your hands when you figure out love is all that matters after all it sure makes everything else seem so small

were not words henry were people

words are how others define us but we can define ourselves any way we choose

i was feeling insecure you might not love me anymore

you’re sorry i damn near drank myself to death i could barely get out of bed i shattered my phone into a million pieces on new year’s eve to keep from calling you … and you’re sorry

i bit my lip and nodded ashamed i had no idea what he’d been through and hearing his say the words made sharp pain twist inside my chest i’m so … so sorry

you’re forgiven he said with a grin don’t ever do it again

i won’t i promise

he flashed his dimple and shook his head i fucking love you

love is what moves the world ive always thoughtit is the only thing which allows men and women to stand in a world where gravity always seems to want to pull them downbring them lowand make them crawl

she thought she was independent and strong but she got one small taste of love and she was hungrier than anyone she was ravenous

it took me years to figure out that upset was upset and tumultuousness was not the same thing as passion love isnt drama

love is a fruit in season at all times and within reach of every hand

he will love only once  but it will be for always

quit being so hard on yourself we are what we are we love what we love we dont need to justify it to anyone not even to ourselves

you must learn to forgive a man when hes in love hes always a nuisance

magnus had come to a horrible realization one that he knew would cause him nothing but pain and suffering from that day forward

but there was no changing the truth of it

he had fallen in love with her

the difference between the love of a man and the love of a woman is that a man will always give reasons for loving but a woman gives no reasons for loving

ive decided that im not going to try to squeeze myself into a friendship that hurts me anymore im going to let her go and just be friends with people who make me feel good about myself

if you’re searching for a quote that puts your feelings into words – you won’t find it

you can learn every language and read every word ever written – but you’ll never find what’s in your heart

how can you

he has it

like youre riding a train at night across some vast plain and you

catch a glimpse of a tiny light in a window of a farmhouse in an

instant its sucked back into the darkness behind and vanishes but

if you close your eyes that point of light stays with you just

barely for a few moments

and what do you know of love

that it must be a choice

oh my naive thief  i pause briefly to meet his gaze love is rarely a choice

every time you almost die i almost die myself

what business had i to think of one that never thought of me

the most basic and somehow forgettable thing is this love is not pain love is goodness and real loveits less shiny than solid and simple

and all i could think was that i would like to spend every morning for the rest of my life waking up beside her

love sought is good but givn unsought is better

its become impossible to deny he means something to me

traveling in the company of those we love is home in motion

in this story

i am the poet

youre the poetry

do you remember what you said to me once that you could help me only by loving me wellyou did love me for a moment and it helped me it has always helped me

his heart had been right there was only one

i begin to long for some little language such as lovers use broken words inarticulate words like the shuffling of feet on pavement

i know your soul everything else is just an ornament

let this hell be our heaven

love one another but make not a bond of love

let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls

fill each others cup but drink not from one cup

give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf

sing and dance together and be joyous but let each one of you be alone

even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music

far too many people opened their hearts and lives at the drop of a hat why give someone that power over you why endow them with the ability to hurt you that much let someone in and you were asking for an emotional kicking some day

the process of falling in love at first sight is as final as it is swift in such a case but the growth of true friendship may be a lifelong affair

kev to win

books are to me as homemade tattoos are to an inmate cant get enough of them

…if a man can be properly said to love something it must be clear that he feels affection for it as a whole and does not love part of it to the exclusion of the rest

if she’s not careful i might just fall in love with her tonight

you must learn to know the difference between tales and the truth my liza she would say fairy tales have a habit of ending too soon they never show what happens afterwards when the prince and princess ride off the page

do you know what i see in you now the usual aura a steady golden yellow healthy and strong with spikes of purple here and there but when i do this

he rested a hand on my hip and my whole body tensed up that hand moved around my hip slipping under my shirt to rest on the small of my back my skin burned where he touched me and the places that were untouched longed for that heat

i hope you find someone who knows how to love you when you are sad

for awhile i thought that was love

im ruined beyond repair is what i fearand if so in time wed both be wretched and bitter

i know people can be mended not all and some more immediately than others but some can be i dont see why not you

why not me

youd be surprised what people will do for money that they wouldnt do for

above all i have been a sentient being a thinking animal on this beautiful planet and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure

my love is something valuable to me which i ought not to throw away without reflection

love is it just a word that boys use to manipulate girls

that is the rule of the wilds you must be bigger and stronger and tougher you must hurt or be hurt

say you’ll marry me when i come back or before god i won’t go i’ll stay around here and play a guitar under your window every night and sing at the top of my voice and compromise you so you’ll have to marry me to save your reputation

i love how you talk to lytlings you dont talk down to them you respect them and anybody can tell youre actually interested in what they have to say

i love your skin like copper dusted over with gold and your eyes – theyre the color of a forest lake shaded by evergreens one of the secret places that only the demonai know about

i love the scent of you – when youve been out in the fresh air and that perfume you put behind your ears sometimes

believe it or not i even love your road smell – of sweat and horses and leather and wool

i want to breathe you in for the rest of my life

this is the true measure of love when we believe that we alone can love that no one could ever have loved so before us and that no one will ever love in the same way after us

i knowand i love you but i dont think we love each other in the same way andi think keeping you near me would destroy me

and the two of them loved each other for a long time in silence without making love again

wow said adrian he sat down on the bed and tested its bounciness giving it a nod of approval this is amazing what do you think buttercup

i have no words i said honestly

he patted the spot beside him want to try it out

infatuation is not quite the same thing as love its more like loves shady second cousin whos always borrowing money and cant hold down a job

whoever loves much performs much and can accomplish much and what is done in love is done well

love is the only future god offers

i love you beyond paint beyond melodies beyond words and i hope you will always feel that even when im not around to tell you so

suddenly it was too hard to be in his presence too painful to know that he would belong to someone else

the true miracle lies in our eagerness to allow appreciate and honor the uniqueness and freedom of each sentient being to sing the song of their heart

tucker strokes my hair theres something so tender about the gesture it might as well have been him whispering i love you

youre not lost kaylee you cant ever be lost because ill always know where you are and if im not there with you im on my way and nothing standing between us will be standing for very long

she is delightfully chaotic a beautiful mess loving her is a splendid adventure

they don’t want me they’re curious why you want me and anyway i feel sorry for anyone that thinks they have a chance i am hopelessly and completely in love with you

we were very different and we disagreed about a lot of things but he was always so interesting you know

the artist always has the masters in his eyes

what will survive of us is love

from a writer

it’s just so strange

you used to love me

and now you’re a stranger

who happens to know all

of my secrets

no im not mistaken i know you dont love me but im going to fight for your love there are some things in life that are worth fighting for to the end you are worth it

to love someone why do you need societys approval and permission

he didnt look like the same person who picked me up this morning noahsarcastic distant untouchable noahcared and that made him real

why is it that words like these seem dull and cold is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name

was it all in my head a lunar trick

her stomach twisted no she shook her head fervently how to explain that she hadn’t had the gift before that she couldn’t have used it against him i would never lie—

the words faded she had lied everything he knew about her had been a lie

i’m so sorry she finished the words falling lamely in the open air

kai peeled his eyes away finding some place of resignation off in the glistening garden you’re even more painful to look at than she is

nothing of real worth can ever be bought love friendship honour valour respect all these things have to be earned

we join spokes together in a wheel

but it is the center hole

that makes the wagon move

we shape clay into a pot

but it is the emptiness inside

that holds whatever we want

we hammer wood for a house

but it is the inner space

that makes it livable

we work with being

but nonbeing is what we use

it’s a blessed thing to love and feel loved in return

true friends will always push you towards the great possibilities of your future false friends will always chain you to the mistakes in your past

she puts her hands on either side of my face and the room falls away i have never gotten so lost in a kiss before

and then the space between us explodes my heart keeps missing beats and my hands cannot bring her close enough to me i taste her and realize i have been starving

i have loved before but it didnt feel like this

i have kissed before but it didnt burn me alive

maybe it lasts a minute and maybe its an hour all i know is that kiss and how soft her skin is when it brushes against mine and that even if i did not know it until now i have been waiting for this person forever

love demands expression it will not stay still stay silent be good be modest be seen and not heard no it will break out in tongues of praise the high note that smashes the glass and spills the liquid

ten long trips around the sun since i last saw that smile but only joy and thankfulness that on a tiny world in the vastness for a couple of moments in the immensity of time we were one

to long a sacrifice can make a stone of a heart

your heart’s strength is measured by how hard it holds on your self worth and faith is measured by finally letting go however your peace is measured by how long you don’t look back

why dont you want anyone to know

tasha ozera is an amazing woman shes beautiful and shes brave but she doesnt

she doesnt get you i finished

he nodded i knew that but i still wanted the relationship i knew it would be easy and that she could take me away from you i thought she could make me forget you

id thought the same thing about mason but she couldnt

yes and sothats a problem

she was afraid of heights

but she was

much more afraid

you dont fall in love with someone because its convenient

in the slaughterhouse of love they kill only the best none of the weak or deformed dont run away from this dying whoevers not killed for love is dead meat

i felt his other hand sear hot against my cheek he bent his head and in a voice that jack couldn’t hear said when you came down the stairs and fell into me that was the moment then his lips pressed against mine

wine enters through the mouth

love the eyes

i raise the glass to my mouth

i look at you

what i was trying to say he whispered is that i see you in everything there isn’t a word for you that means enough because you’re everything to me

did you know we were leaving for idris catarina told me shed been summoned to make a portal i guessed magnus said wryly i was a little surprised you hadnt called or texted to tell me you were going away

you never answer my calls or texts said alec

that hasnt stopped you before

everyone gives up eventually alec said besides jace broke my phone

what alec asked honestly puzzled

youre justyoure soi really want to kiss you magnus said abruptly and then shook his head see this is why i havent been willing to see you

vane grabbed me dulac let’s chat

chat britishspeak for stand still while i yell at you

hmm…now that i think about it housecats are often coddled and petted you don’t pet me nearly enough you must be a lax owner how selfish of you to deprive your cat of attention

him that i love i wish to be free  even from me

i know the truth now youve figured out im falling in love with you and youre trying to make me stop by hurting me this way well it wont work

one way or another im going to make you care about me yes i am unless your cold attitude kills me first

its only fair connor if im going to be miserable by god so are you

i am not a common wench and i will not be treated like one

ive got you i swear to god ive got you said noah stay with me echo

i wanted to i wanted to stay with him but the shouting and screams and glass breaking in my mind grew louder make it stop

he tightened his grip on my arms fight echo youve got to fucking fight come on baby youre safe

the first question which the priest and the levite asked was if i stop to help this man what will happen to me butthe good samaritan reversed the question if i do not stop to help this man what will happen to him

i love you more than songs can say but i cant keep running after yesterday

i love jere more than anybody he’s my brother my family i hate myself for doing this but when i see you two together i hate him too his voice broke

don’t marry him don’t be with him be with me

it’s impossible he snapped

why

because i’m sebastian lord st vincent i can’t be celibate everyone knows that

a person learns how to love himself through the simple acts of loving and being loved by someone else

no woman can love a weak man hard enough to make him strong

the suns gone dim and the moons gone black for i loved him and he didnt love back

a heart once stolen can never be taken back

a girl can wait for the right man to come along but in the meantime that doesnt mean she cant have a wonderful time with all the wrong ones

now as we stand three feet apart and stare at each other i feel the full distance that comes with spending so much time apart a moment filled with the electricity of a first meeting and the uncertainty of strangers

marriage is not a process for prolonging the life of love sir it merely mummifies its corpse

happiness is the china shop love is the bull

for men i think love is a thing formed of equal parts lust and astonishment the astonishment part women understand the lust part they only think they understand

if i love you is that a fact or a weapon

its funny no matter how hard you try you cant close your heart forever and the minute you open it up you never know whats going to come in but when it does you just have to go for it because if you dont theres not point in being here

we often mistake love for fireworks  for drama and dysfunction but real love is very quiet very still its boring if seen from the perspective of high drama love is deep and calm  and constant

always said the count i am always in love

for beatrice when we first met

i was lonely and you were pretty

now i am pretty lonely

heartbreak is a loss divorce is a piece of paper

animals are reliable many full of love true in their affections predictable in their actions grateful and loyal difficult standards for people to live up to

i know im not going to be in your head all the time but once you know me ill be forever in your heart

clary jace said open your eyes

im done i dont need anything more out of life i have you and thats enough

you cant make anyone love you you just have to reveal who you are and take your chances

love people who hate you pray for people who have wronged you it won’t just change their life…it’ll change yours
