pay the price

and be what you want to be

and sweet honey from all my failures

your success and happiness lie in you

it is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped

be curious about the world in which you live look things up chase down every reference go deeper than anybody elsethats how youll get ahead

opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them if you are influenced by opinions when you reach decisions you will not succeed in any undertaking

remember your greatness

before you were born

and were still too tiny for

the human eye to see

you won the race for life

from among  million competitors

and yet

how fast you have forgotten

your strength

when your very existence

is proof of your greatness

you were born a winner

one who defied the odds

by surviving the most gruesome

battle of them all

and now that you are a giant

why do you even doubt victory

against smaller numbers

and wider margins

the only walls that exist

are those you have placed in your mind

and whatever obstacles you conceive

exist only because you have forgotten

what you have already

poetry by suzy kassem

those who dont jump will never fly

the most important thing is this to sacrifice what you are now for what you can become tomorrow

theres no reason to have a plan b because it distracts from plan a

early success is a terrible teacher youre essentially being rewarded for a lack of preparation so when you find yourself in a situation where you must prepare you cant do it you dont know how

even though our time in this life is temporary if we live well enough our legacy will last forever

what is considered impossible is someone else’s opinion what is possible is my decision

the bird dares to break the shell then the shell breaks open and the bird can fly openly this is the simplest principle of success you dream you dare and and you fly

sometimes it is good to be in uncomfortable situations because it is in finding our way out of such difficulties that we learn valuable lessons

dont look so worried most successful missions are just a series of barely averted disasters

acquiring wisdom is great but it is not the goal applying it is

when you fail that is when you get closer to success

there is only one successto be able to spend life in your own way

find a purpose to serve not a lifestyle to live

the roughest roads often lead to the top

you may be disappointed if you fail but you are doomed if you don’t try

people are successful because they think and act like successful people

the road to success is dotted with many tempting parking spaces

dont worry about being effective just concentrate on being faithful to the truth

it’s a lack of clarity that creates chaos and frustration those emotions are poison to any living goal

the whole secret of a successful life is to find out what is ones destiny to do and then do it

stop blaming outside circumstances for your inside chaos

you rarely win but sometimes you do

nearly only counts in horseshoes and handgrenades

what do you mean i have to wait for someones approval  im someone  i approve  so i give myself permission to move forward with my full support

our business in life is not to succeed but to continue to fail in good spirits

if youre waiting until you feel talented enough to make it youll never make it

you have succeeded in life when all you really want is only what you really need

never run from the enemy tackle them

doing the tough things sets winners apart from losers

the struggles we endure today will be the ‘good old days’ we laugh about tomorrow

you make mistakes mistakes dont make you

make the choice to embrace this day do not let your today be stolen by the ghost of yesterday or the todo list of tomorrow it’s inspiring to see all the wonderfully amazing things that can happen in a day in which you participate

if you think you can then you can

no guts no story

to burn always with this hard gemlike flame to maintain this ecstasy is success in life

stop waiting for the perfect day or the perfect moment take this day this moment and lead it to perfection

never feel shame for trying and failing for he who has never failed is he who has never tried

a person who doubts himself is like a man who would enlist in the ranks of his enemies and bear arms against himself he makes his failures certain by himself being the first person to be convinced of it

success is a great deodorant

be happy with who you are and what you do and you can do anything you want

do not let another day go by where your dedication to other peoples opinions is greater than your dedication to your own emotions

it is well known that a vital ingredient of success is not knowing that what youre attempting cant be done

i am struck by how sharing our weakness and difficulties is more nourishing to others than sharing our qualities and successes

do not sit still start moving now in the beginning you may not go in the direction you want but as long as you are moving you are creating alternatives and possibilities

if your success is not on your own terms if it looks good to the world but does not feel good in your heart it is not success at all

no other success can compensate for failure in the home

the line between failure and success is so fine   that we are often on the line and do not know it

when you live your life by poor standards you inflict damage on everyone who crosses your path especially those you love

the secret to success is constancy of purpose

the secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it anything that you believe you can do strong enough you can do anything as long as you believe

if you want to find happiness find gratitude

whole life is a search for beauty but when the beauty is found inside the search ends and a beautiful journey begins

participate in your dreams today there are unlimited opportunities available with this new day take action on those wonderful dreams youve had in your mind for so long remember success is something you experience when you act accordingly

be patient your skin took a while to deteriorate give it some time to reflect a calmer inner state as one of my friends states on his facebook profile the true losers in life are not those who try and fail but those who fail to try

the power to change your life lies in the simplest of steps

today is the only day in which we have any power

small shifts in your thinking and small changes in your energy can lead to massive alterations of your end result

soar with wit conquer with dignity handle with care

the difference between greed and ambition is a greedy person desires things he isnt prepared to work for

some say if you want success surround yourself with successful people i say if you want true and lasting success surround yourself with people of integrity

judging is preventing us from understanding a new truth free yourself from the rules of old judgments and create the space for new understanding

fear can only grow in darkness once you face fear with light you win

your life is a printout of your thoughts

you cant just wish change you have to live the change in order for it to become a reality

i was taught to strive not because there were any guarantees of success but because the act of striving is in itself the only way to keep faith with life

dont be afraid of failure this is the way to succeed

the bottom line is insults only hurt when they come from someone i respect

you only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you dont do too many things wrong

i never fail its just that the people around me succeed more than i

with one days reading a man may have the key in his hands

if you don’t know exactly where you’re going how will you know when you get there

there is absolutely no greater high than challenging the power structure as a nobody giving it your all and winning

if you really want the key to success start by doing the opposite of what everyone else is doing

you will find the key to success under the alarm clock

god’s word is not just to be heard and repeated it is to be breathed lived and emulated with each action

it is not the possession of truth but the success which attends the seeking after it that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him

it is not a failure to readjust my sails to fit the waters i find myself in

success is neither magical nor mysterious success is the natural consequence of consistently applying basic fundamentals

life is a balanced system of learning and evolution whether pleasure or pain every situation in your life serves a purpose it is up to us to recognize what that purpose could be

if you want to give yourself a fair chance to succeed never expect too much too soon

almost anyone can be an author the business is to collect money and fame from this state of being

what you perceive as a failure today may actually be a crucial step towards the success you seek never give up

it is not as much about who you used to be as it is about who you choose to be

how to win in life

listen more

dont let people tell you it cant be done

make no excuses

flaming enthusiasm backed by horse sense and persistence is the quality that most frequently makes for success

do you love yourself enough to be what you love yourself enough to want

lifes trials will test you and shape you but don’t let them change who you are

one of the most healing things you can do is recognize where in your life you are your own poison

i think for anyone to become good at something they have to fail a lot too and they have to be completely unafraid to fail or theyll never make it to the next level

what seems to us as bitter trials are often blessings in disguise

the distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success

are you going to allow the world around you to change while you remain stagnant make this the time you throw away old habits that have hindered your happiness and success and finally allow your greatest self to flourish

success is the doing not the getting in the trying not the triumph success is a personal standard reaching for the highest that is in us becoming all that we can be if we do our best we are a success

how would your life be different if…you pretended those around you were deaf to your words let today be the day…you let your actions speak and communicate your feelings and intentions

life itself is simpleits just not easy

you have been blessed with immeasurable power to make positive changes in your life

i cannot say this too strongly do not compare yourselves to others be true to who you are and continue to learn with all your might

you are where you are right now because of the actions youve taken or maybe the inaction youve taken

dont be afraid to give up the good to go for the great

take your victories whatever they may be cherish them use them but dont settle for them

your life begins to change the day you take responsibility for it

never be surprised by your own success

dont waste your time hating a failure failure is a greater teacher than success listen learn go on

you can have it all just not all at the same time

to become successful one must put themselves in the paths of giants

sometimes not getting what you want is a brilliant stroke of luck

success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal

success is not a comparison of what we have done with what others have done

the problem for a lot of people is that they dont really know what they want they have vague desire to do something creative or to earn more money or to be free but they cant really pin down what it is precisely that they want

so they drift from one thing to another enjoying some moments and hating others but never really finding fulfillment or success

this is why its hard to lead a successful life whatever that means to you when you dont know what you want

success is doing what you want to do when you want where you want with whom you want as much as you want

if you feel obsessed to prove something to the world
