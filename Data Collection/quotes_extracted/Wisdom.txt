before you were born

and were still too tiny for

your strength

is proof of your greatness

against smaller numbers

and wider margins

are those you have placed in your mind

and whatever obstacles you conceive

exist only because you have forgotten

what you have already

featherweight by suzy kassem

i sat by the ocean and questioned the moon about my destiny

i revealed to it that i was beginning to feel smaller compared to others

because the more secrets of the universe i would unlock

the smaller in size i became

i didnt understand why i wasnt feeling larger instead of smaller

i thought that seeking truth was what was required of us all –

to show us the way not to make us feel lost

up against the odds

in a devilish game partitioned by

an invisible wall

then the next morning

a bird appeared at my window just as the sun began

spreading its yolk over the horizon

it remained perched for a long time

gazing at me intently to make sure i knew i wasn’t dreaming

then its words gently echoed throughout my mind

the journey to truth itself

the lighter the heart the purer it is

the purer the heart the closer to light it becomes

and the heavier the heart

the more chained to this hell

it will remain

and just like that it flew off towards the sun

so i picked it up

and fastened it to a toothpick

to dip into ink

these are the three stages of enlightenment the three glimpses of satori

the first stage enlightenment

a glimpse of the whole

the first stage of enlightenment is short glimpse from faraway of the whole it is a short glimpse of being

there is a gap a silence and emptiness where there is not thought between you and existence

you and existence meet and merge for a moment

and for the first time the seed the thirst and longing for enlightenment the meeting between you and existence will grow in your heart

the second stage of enlightenment

silence relaxation togetherness inner being

the second stage of enlightenment is a new order a harmony from within which comes from the inner being it is the quality of freedom

the inner chaos has disappeared and a new silence relaxation and togetherness has arisen

your own wisdom from within has arisen

a subtle ego is still present in the second stage of enlightenment

the hindus has three names for the ego

ahamkar which is the ordinary ego

asmita which is the quality of amness of no ego it is a very silent ego not aggreessive but it is still a subtle ego

atma the third word is atma when the amness is also lost this is what buddha callas noself pure being

in the second stage of enlightenment you become capable of being in the inner being in the gap in the meditative quality within in the silence and emptiness

for hours for days you can remain in the gap in utter aloneness in god

still you need effort to remain in the gap and if you drop the effort the gap will disappear

love meditation and prayer becomes the way to increase the effort in the search for god

then the second stage becomes a more conscious effort now you know the way you now the direction

the third stage of enlightenment

ocean wholeness noself pure being

at the third stage of enlightenment at the third step of satori our individual river flowing silently suddenly reaches to the ocean and becomes one with the ocean

at the third satori the ego is lost and there is atma pure being you are but without any boundaries the river has become the ocean the whole

it has become a vast emptiness just like the pure sky

the third stage of enlightenment happens when you have become capable of finding the inner being the meditative quality within the gap the inner silence and emptiness so that it becomes a natural quality

you can find the gap whenever you want

this is what tantra callas mahamudra the great orgasm what buddha calls nirvana what lao tzu calls tao and what jesus calls the kingdom of god

you have found the door to god

you have come home

deep inside of you

that are never shattered

and are never taken from you

and that is the dream to be completely free

completely yourself

and completely at one with all of life

the dream of fulfilment

the dream of love

the dream of eternal life

does the human being think that we cannot assemble his bones

yes indeed we are able even to reshape his fingertips

your story shared with authenticity can do more to sell you than any sales pitch marketing piece or ad

your knowledge is not in question but your wisdom is

ọgbọ́n n ologbon ọpọlọ n ọlọpọlọ́ just ask for grace

all life amazes me

knowledge begins with the acceptance of ignorance

understanding from the past wisdom for the present vision for the future

the wise is a fool aware of the reasons for his sorrow

his mind on the opportune moment recovering a key memory

the fool is the one who thinks wisdom to be an incessant state of mind

the messaging in your sharing pitching and marketing should invite people to want to learn more over making them feel like don’t know anything at all

and the insanity of it all is that i’m racing through life attempting at every step to create the very things that i’m stepping on in the racing

where theres hurting whats the learning

those who shine in the dark are afraid of stepping into the light

it takes courage to accept ones ignorance

it is ever the way of the knowing i have often thought it is like a light blooming on a dark sea as it increases so does the depth and size of the unknown the most wise are those who know how little they know

would you want anyone to read see or hear

that picture video blog quote audio or rant

tomorrow next week next month next year or in five years

then dont post it today

the wise man listens to the women in his life

all our lives we redefine ourselves as we mature why stop now keep on living

life is a like a long note it persists without variance without wavering there is no cessation in sound or pause in tempo it continues on and we must master it or it will master us

do you think you can rule the world and actually improve it i do not believe it can be done the world is sacred you cannot improve it ultimately you can only change yourselves

you dont lose a person

like a set of keys because you dont find them again

and you can still get to where youre going

you are the spirit and the ideas you put out

i never form an opinion on anyone how they are in this moment is all that matters how they are tomorrow let us see tomorrow must be created not concretized right now

wisdom from within

the universe is here for a reason and you have to find out what that reason is

the only antidote to perfectionism is to turn away from every whiff of plastic or gloss and follow our grief pursue our imperfections and exaggerate our eccentricities until the things we once sought to hide reveals themselves as our majesty

stress brings on distress so to avoid the latter dispense with the former

if we talked and wrote only about things we know how much silence

please give credit where credit is due

are you up to code with your content creation conduct

honor the creators if you are going to use their content to promote yourself or your business to your audience

if you are able to follow your passion by reaching out to as many human beings as possible – and inspire them through your experience wisdom instinct and words you are truly blessed

wisdom from within

here we are talking about energy again negative energy results in a power drain or loss on the network so to speak positive energy allows for a free flow of power

all of these go into promoting a positive flow of energy

time to recharge becomes shorter

and

life becomes better for all

we can’t delete our memories but we can choose what we remember

focus on your messaging before you focus on your marketing

the skip to marketing when the messaging is not in place makes for more expensive marketing costs confusion with the public and their perceptions as well as a lack of continuity and endurance growth

there are hundreds of ways to tell a story and thousands of ways to tell different parts of a story

still be sure you have your story and the foundation of its messaging solid situated and clear before bringing it to a public that has a very short attention span and tends to read only headlines

many will need to see you telling your story and different parts of it a number of times before they click through read on connect or buy from you

if you cant say it to their face dont say it behind their backs

speaking in confidence has lost a great deal of confidence in that being true these days

with the ears and recording devices out there that are looking for you to

slip something out for them to use against you

share something you shouldnt

say something that could be taken the wrong way

or some one looking to get a sound byte that could bite you in the rear

it is good to keep those elements in mind as you are talking texting emailing posting or sharing anything and everything

think of it as preventative maintenance and crisis management to keep a crisis from happening

whomever holds the purse strings controls the cash

the only shortcut i have found to life is to sharpen my teeth on the bones of the wise

if the pen is mightier than the sword the correct aphorism should be live by the sword die by the pen’

i erred therefore i am… to paraphrase alexander pope and rené descartes

some say imitation is the best form of flattery and i say nay its the worst form of stealing

whomever coined the phrase a penny for your thoughts also phrased a coin

what is the yardstick of your success

complacency breeds contempt it also breeds tragedy

your aim has to be to reach a million people with your knowledge wisdom as well as experience and be an integral part of their personal and professional development

sometimes the reason why our problem dont go away it is because we glorify our problems too much rather coming up with solution

would you want to be marketed to with the same tactics that you use to market to others if not then consider changing the message

without wisdom life is superior to you with wisdom you are superior to life

when we are surrounded by difficulties any force in the world can help us without inspiration from inside

if freshness is elevated then the rock can be severed and reach the destination

when they expect you to give up thats when you should put your foot down and double speed

a philosophically informed vision helps us respond to reversals intelligently not impulsively so that we can act to mitigate the situation not aggravate it

emotions are the ornaments of life but we need to choose the emotions that bring out our higher side not our lower side

knowledge is having a mental history of past events and wisdom is having the ability to relate those past events to the present and future

wisdom defined is knowledge gained through experience

without selfknowledge the god that you seek is the god of illusion and illusion inevitably brings conflict and sorrow

a common blunder that we make is that we often talk about people instead of talking with people

during our life journey we are not here to see through each other we are here to see each other through

the authenticity in your story the authority in your delivery and the personalization of your presentation will make you that much more real and able to reach that many more people in your real estate business

they leave you and forget you its not that youre not right for them its because they dont deserve you

to remove thorns from the path of those who have filled our path with thorns  that is the summit of selfless love

the ramayanas message is not that we passively give in to destiny but that we gallantly stick to duty

angry folks are not always wise

watch it

levelheaded pragmatism in the face of destiny is the most empowering option in a dis empowering situation

destiny is not arbitrary or inimical it is orderly and reactional it gives us reactions to our own past actions

valuing relations over possessions is foundational for the sustenance of family society and humanity at large

writing quotes is therapy for my damaged brain

wealthbuilding is a crockpot not a microwave

anger occurs from injustices against us

life without liberty is a life not lived and life without truth is a life not understood

a brand messaging strategist focuses on the authenticity authority optics psychology and perceptions of a brand persona or product

silent people can be misleading suggesting profundity and thoughtfulness where there may be none

stupidity is a charm that leaves its master slowly if it leaves at all

is it possible to rediscover life within the limits of a mind that is still basically unaware of what can be experienced beyond the mind

stand against the action not the person

reasons are what give us the wisdom to answer the right questions

some people dislike diagnoses disagreeably calling them boxes and labels but ive always found comfort in preexisting conditions i like to know that im not pioneering an inexplicable experience

mathematical problems or puzzles are important to real mathematics like solving reallife problems just as fables stories and anecdotes are important to the young in understanding real life

if there’s one thing i’ve learned in my years on this planet it’s that the happiest and most fulfilled people are those who devoted themselves to something bigger and more profound than merely their own selfinterest

be wise be intelligent but dont forget to be stupid at times

life provides ten times more wisdom and education than any academic institution

knowledge cuts and differentiates while wisdom soothes and integrates

a dead enemy is a dead enemy no matter how he is slain

knitted with love and grace

she is made of joy speaks from peace and guides through wisdom

she is a bearer of hope and nurturer of future

created for a marvelous work

she is called mother

acknowledge if you are feeling bad there is no need to convince yourself that you should not feel that way

use determination to fly even if you do not have wings

the higher the ladder you climb the more distant you get from the ground make sure you can come down to the ground anytime at your will

you must know who you are because the world will see you the way you see yourself

singling out a perceived threat to our end goal of peace does not serve that end

everything is temporary only how you take it can make that permanent

almost everyone knows when to run but only a few know when to stop

no action is a strong action master this invisible move

thoughts are extremely powerful everything that becomes your reality must be first accepted by your thoughts

besides death of a loved one adversity enhances character and augments wisdom more than any other trial adversity challenges our will requires strategic thinking through arduous stretches on our journey

fool me once shame on me fool me twice stop fucking lieing

even so is the libyan fable famed abroad the eagle pierced by the bowsped shaft looked at the feathered device and said thus not by others but by means of our own plumage are we slain

leap to conclusions and you leap to confusions

perhaps the savages will always be in control phillip said gloomily perhaps greed will always outweigh wisdom in the councils of the mighty perhaps fear will always overcome compassion in the mind of a man with a sword in his hand

anyone can have the best product people and team but arrogance ignorance and avoidance when it comes to communication will destroy any brand concept or company

to know youyou have to know god because knowing him is knowing you

if you are working yourself to death how can any investor feel safe confident and secure investing in you

the search of truth and understanding is an infinite adventure

if there was no change there would be no universe

just one day was worth more than all the kingdoms in the world

part of the fun in life is exactly this running risks

where will my heart lead if ive yet to wander so many unknown paths

the true spiritual journey is stronger than the reasons that lead us to it

everything and everybody is the same this is the mystery and the end

i like to equate the mediocrity of everyday matters with the force of gravity it pulls you downwards for wisdom to be obtained the escape velocity must be reached and maintained

always measure one’s richness by the things one chooses not to buy

true love a question for which there is no answer

he closed the door but he knew that for those who seek to step beyond the threshold the door is always open you need only turn the knob

the intellect does not reign supreme in matters of the heart

the reason some people do not become great is because the met great people but asked the wrong questions the problem here is not the absence of access it is bad sense

if it can give me wisdom i will go for that road and figure a way of dealing with the obstacles i will bank on my intelligence and ability both gained through eons of evolution to help me out

the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing

as i assimilate only that as the qualification of knowledge not beyond that exemplifying

most who preach carry the illusion of knowledge those who are wise and actually have some amount of real knowledge keep learning and sharing they don’t preach

the wisdom of the sun is not in producing light and heat but in sharing them with everyone and everything wisdom that is not shared means conceit and if there is conceit there is no wisdom

when a person experiences the divine he can no longer condemn anyone love becomes natural to him because he starts seeing godliness in everybody

the person that has entered the inner temple of the heart of all living beings truly sees

to experience godliness one has to recognize that which is hidden deep in the inner temple of the heart the divine is hidden deep within yourself

godliness is the original source within everybody godliness is the ultimate mystery godliness is the universal self it is the ultimate limit of existence

godliness is everywhere everything in the world is a reflection of the divine to recognize the divine is the ultimate wisdom the ultimate truth

the funny thing about wisdom is that it comes when most of the important decisions in life have already been made

in the great schools of the intellectual world there is no course on wisdom

the wise do not take desperate measures

nature has made wisdom so elusive as it can lead to things like the discovery of life’s purposelessness and make some disappointed people plunge into depression thereby risking their survival

your mind is pregnant with the potential for great intellectual and sophisticated thoughts on the most profound matters leave the mediocrity aside and allow it to give birth

pain as a lifeform in a universe of objects is unavoidable but suffering is a choice

we as well as other objects in the universe are unified through the manifestation of life it is possible for us to consciously awaken and nurture this dimension of life energy consciousness

the quickest way to change your attitude toward pain is tho accept the fact that everything that happens to is has been designed for our spiritual growth

the day machines become conscious they will create their own set of problems why would they even bother about us

thus then i too became a dreamer with only one longing the longing for wisdom for that spirit touch which should open my eyes and enable me to see

we have the money but dont get the

one day well die to fulfil our wishes by trying

still we want to get heaven even after dying

for wisdom is like her name she is not readily perceived by many

i may appear despicable and a little withered yet by reason of my knowledge and wisdom i outsoar most men who dot this world emperors and kings are astonished at my pleasing discourse and sweetness of the tongue

the eye is not a lake still it filled with tears

the enemy is not a seed still it grows

character is not metal still it gets stained

dignity is not the body still it gets injured

a human being is not the season still it changes

the key to embracing who you are is experienced now however it is never about focusing on the now instead it is about being the now

people greatly value knowledge and intelligence but not wisdom

embracing who you are now will allow you to be who you will become your true essence will fully blossom spontaneously through this simple acknowledgement

focus brings fore knowledge which results in favour and freedom

nothing can be well learned that is not agreeable to one’s natural taste

over the coming years her back would be worn away as the goddess of wisdom was ground down by generations of christian feet the ‘triumph’ of christianity was complete

i feel that those who have richness through health  wealth can travel to any part of the planet but only those with richness through highquality thoughts and great intellect can travel to any part of the universe

you are always the totality of anything no matter what you experience or confront

how would it be to not do anything in a given moment does this sound impossible this is easier than the mind thinks it is often about letting go and allowing instead of making something happen this nonreaction opens the portal to stillness

please focus on this simple realization there is only every now and how you interact with this moment decides everything that you are experiencing

communication and openness are essential in nurturing understanding fairness and respect

he who relies only on the intellect must walk with crutches even though they be set with precious stones and at the first breath of fate will break like matchsticks

anyone who knows more than me in a certain area is an expert compared to me

clarissa noticed his eyes they were like indifferent tides shielding knowledge of an impending storm

it’s weird how we have to get a little older to realize that people are just people it should be obvious but it’s not

the ashes of our mistakes are between us theres still smoke from the fire isnt there

i am well practiced in avoidance and indifference though the hollowness in my soul resents her absence i wear the mask i must

being no longer human why should i

pretend humanity or don the frail attire

men have i known and men but never one

was grown so free an essence or become

so simply element as what i am

the mist goes from the mirror and i see

behold the world of forms is swept beneath

turmoil grown visible beneath our peace

and we that are grown formless rise above

fluids intangible that have been men

we seem as statues round whose highrisen base

some overflowing river is run mad

in us alone the element of calm

where is the truth then where does truth exist behind the lie within the lie is truth that which we seek to know or that which we avoid knowing

the good news is we usually make all our mistakes when were young the bad news is that they bury us when were old

daddy says that one day all ill think about is people i used to know

insinuation is not truth just conjecture

memories that cease to be painful are still nostalgic and nostalgia made her sad always about a loss of time

everybody has got to hate someone human nature

there is a cost to deceit she whispered a price to pay and reached over to hold his hand

that sounds like chloe she appeased people to keep them from getting upset to chloe lies held purpose

clarissa remembered why she didnt like him he was astucious an ambiguous villain in a gentlemans three piece suit

age is the ambrosia waiting to be sipped the compliment hiding in the wings waiting to be given to that which is too young today to value the character it will have tomorrow

how come i am receiving a new year our gift from time a happy new year

awaken for life is only a fleeting moment between coming and going

i prefer to be seen as a knownothing idiot than a knowitall bigot

perspective heals us perspective empowers us and if we let it perspective will make us wiser we are often built by the same things we thought were destroying us

love is sometimes conveyed by expressing our emotions and sometimes by concealing them

to remove thorns from the path of those who have filled our path with thorns—that is the summit of selfless love

i am at one with the hawaiian spirits of mauna kea

it was jelena though another kind of arrogance to believe you could understand the way the world was made it could not be done there was too much you needed to be open to it though to what your life gave you and demanded

life is nothing more than an illusion it’s like a poor actor who struts and worries for his hour on the stage and then is never heard from again life is a story told by an idiot full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning

if you want to nourish your stupidity try a little avarice

sometimes the person who benefited most when you forgive someone was yourself

you can always befriend an enemy if you stay kind give them a second chance and make them understand why you did it be trustful but not naïve

the proof of you being alive is having wounds and scars accompanied by some changes in your chemistry this is the impact of life

i did what is right

god knows what happened

are they as fair as my conscience

i put my trust and faith in god

no deed can ever be passed without traces done without shadows gone without remains

does it mean you don’t believe in your powers either this is the first step one takes down there to one’s fatal defeat

what is life but an attempt to let our immortal self defeat our mortality

when beauty withers hope disappears in the cyclone of cares and burdens

we are not the masters of our own fate for to leave something as monumental as that in our own hands is to seal our fate and i suppose that in that sense we might be the masters of our own fate

i tell the story of my life through quotes

maybe the greatest power of all is the power of restraint

in the case of sumer the seven sages were depicted as amphibian fishgarbed beings who emerged from the sea in antediluvian times to teach wisdom to mankind
