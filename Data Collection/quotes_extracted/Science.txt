two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the universe

the seven social sins are

from a sermon given by frederick lewis donaldson in westminster abbey london on march

the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom

never memorize something that you can look up

if we knew what it was we were doing it would not be called research would it

one remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet two never give up work work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it three if you are lucky enough to find love remember it is there and dont throw it away

somewhere something incredible is waiting to be known

—old mans advice to youth never lose a holy curiosity life magazine  may  p

the most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious it is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science

time is a drug too much of it kills you

we are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star but we can understand the universe that makes us something very special

im sure the universe is full of intelligent life its just been too intelligent to come here

an expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field

science and religion are not at odds science is simply too young to understand

in the beginning there was nothing which exploded

that which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence

everything must be made as simple as possible but not simpler

a man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life

though my soul may set in darkness it will rise in perfect light

i have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night

heard melodies are sweet but those unheard are sweeter

the good thing about science is that its true whether or not you believe in it

nothing in life is to be feared it is only to be understood now is the time to understand more so that we may fear less

science is not only compatible with spirituality it is a profound source of spirituality

for me i am driven by two main philosophies know more today about the world than i knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others youd be surprised how far that gets you

your assumptions are your windows on the world scrub them off every once in a while or the light wont come in

space is big you just wont believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is i mean you may think its a long way down the road to the chemists but thats just peanuts to space

if i have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants

if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch you must first invent the universe

it would be possible to describe everything scientifically but it would make no sense it would be without meaning as if you described a beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure

a thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questionsas attempts to find out something success and failure are for him answers above all

life would be tragic if it werent funny

any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic

for me it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion however satisfying and reassuring

so this is it said arthur we are going to die

yes said ford except no wait a minute he suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind arthurs line of vision whats this switch he cried

what where cried arthur twisting round

no i was only fooling said ford we are going to die after all

i believe there is another world waiting for us a better world and ill be waiting for you there

you never change things by fighting the existing reality

to change something build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete

physics is like sex sure it may give some practical results but thats not why we do it

i can see how it might be possible for a man to look down upon the earth and be an atheist but i cannot conceive how a man could look up into the heavens and say there is no god

in my opinion we dont devote nearly enough scientific research to finding a cure for jerks

do you know what we call opinion in the absence of evidence we call it prejudice

if you try and take a cat apart to see how it works the first thing you have on your hands is a nonworking cat

we are an impossibility in an impossible universe

wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it

god does not play dice with the universe

science investigates religion interprets science gives man knowledge which is power religion gives man wisdom which is control science deals mainly with facts religion deals mainly with values the two are not rivals

the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is at all comprehensible

i suppose it is tempting if the only tool you have is a hammer to treat everything as if it were a nail

for after all how do we know that two and two make four or that the force of gravity works or that the past is unchangeable if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind and if the mind itself is controllable – what then

we are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works

i do not feel obliged to believe that the same god who has endowed us with sense reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use

reading after a certain age diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking

student dr einstein arent these the same questions as last years physics final exam

dr einstein yes but this year the answers are different

i learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something

we can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good

the scientist is not a person who gives the right answers hes one who asks the right questions

scientists have calculated that the chances of something so patently absurd actually existing are millions to one

but magicians have calculated that milliontoone chances crop up nine times out of ten

the first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool

if there is any religion that could respond to the needs of modern science it would be buddhism

science is interesting and if you dont agree you can fuck off

note dawkins was quoting a former editor of new scientist magazine who is as yet unidentified possibly jeremy webb

the opposite of a correct statement is a false statement but the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth

the day science begins to study nonphysical phenomena it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence

i dont want to believe i want to know

science my lad is made up of mistakes but they are mistakes which it is useful to make because they lead little by little to the truth

im a pessimist because of intelligence but an optimist because of will

our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions any more than our opinions in physics or geometry

we are a way for the cosmos to know itself

ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge it is those who know little not those who know much who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science

a reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact

it is absurd for the evolutionist to complain that it is unthinkable for an admittedly unthinkable god to make everything out of nothing and then pretend that it is more thinkable that nothing should turn itself into everything

tell me tutor i said is revenge a science or an art

the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and all science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead his eyes are closed

common sense and a sense of humor are the same thing moving at different speeds a sense of humor is just common sense dancing

the more i learn about the universe the less convinced i am that theres any sort of benevolent force that has anything to do with it at all

rest is not idleness and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summers day listening to the murmur of the water or watching the clouds float across the sky is by no means a waste of time

letter to his nephew peter carr advising him in matters of religion

religion is a culture of faith science is a culture of doubt

one thing i have learned in a long life that all our science measured against reality is primitive and childlike  and yet it is the most precious thing we have

it is impossible to escape the impression that people commonly use false standards of measurement — that they seek power success and wealth for themselves and admire them in others and that they underestimate what is of true value in life

dream is not that which you see while sleeping it is something that does not let you sleep

problem is follow me closely here the science is pretty complicated if i cut a hole in the hab the air wont stay inside anymore

there are three stages in scientific discovery first people deny that it is true then they deny that it is important finally they credit the wrong person

how inappropriate to call this planet earth when it is clearly ocean

art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness it trains the mind through the eye and the eye through the mind as the sun colors flowers so does art color life

a number of years ago when i was a freshlyappointed instructor i met for the first time a certain eminent historian of science at the time i could only regard him with tolerant condescension

in a lifetime of being wrong at many a point i was never more wrong it was i not he who was wandering in the periphery it was he not i who lived in the blaze

i had fallen victim to the fallacy of the growing edge the belief that only the very frontier of scientific advance counted that everything that had been left behind by that advance was faded and dead

in the universe it may be that primitive life is very common and intelligent life is fairly rare some would say it has yet to occur on earth

the beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it but the way those atoms are put together

i consider it an extremely dangerous doctrine because the more likely we are to assume that the solution comes from the outside the less likely we are to solve our problems ourselves

nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless there is no intelligence where there is no need of change

science flies you to the moon religion flies you into buildings

to invent you need a good imagination and a pile of junk

the old astronomer to his pupil

reach me down my tycho brahe i would know him when we meet

when i share my later science sitting humbly at his feet

he may know the law of all things yet be ignorant of how

we are working to completion working on from then to now

pray remember that i leave you all my theory complete

lacking only certain data for your adding as is meet

and remember men will scorn it tis original and true

and the obloquy of newness may fall bitterly on you

but my pupil as my pupil you have learned the worth of scorn

you have laughed with me at pity we have joyed to be forlorn

what for us are all distractions of mens fellowship and smiles

what for us the goddess pleasure with her meretricious smiles

you may tell that german college that their honor comes too late

but they must not waste repentance on the grizzly savants fate

though my soul may set in darkness it will rise in perfect light

i have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night

what my boy you are not weeping you should save your eyes for sight

you will need them mine observer yet for many another night

i leave none but you my pupil unto whom my plans are known

you have none but me you murmur and i leave you quite alone

well then kiss me  since my mother left her blessing on my brow

there has been a something wanting in my nature until now

i can dimly comprehend it  that i might have been more kind

might have cherished you more wisely as the one i leave behind

i have never failed in kindness no we lived too high for strife

calmest coldness was the error which has crept into our life

but your spirit is untainted i can dedicate you still

to the service of our science you will further it you will

there are certain calculations i should like to make with you

to be sure that your deductions will be logical and true

and remember patience patience is the watchword of a sage

not today nor yet tomorrow can complete a perfect age

i have sown like tycho brahe that a greater man may reap

but if none should do my reaping twill disturb me in my sleep

so be careful and be faithful though like me you leave no name

see my boy that nothing turn you to the mere pursuit of fame

i must say goodbye my pupil for i cannot longer speak

draw the curtain back for venus ere my vision grows too weak

it is strange the pearly planet should look red as fiery mars

god will mercifully guide me on my way amongst the stars

said during a debate when his opponent asserted that atheism and belief in evolution lead to nazism

again this is not a difference of emphasis between us to suggest that there’s something fascistic about me and about my beliefs is something i wont hear said and you shouldnt believe

no our science is no illusion but an illusion it would be to suppose that what science cannot give us we can get elsewhere

we know very little and yet it is astonishing that we know so much and still more astonishing that so little knowledge can give us so much power

from the will of gbs

he who is not satisfied with a little is satisfied with nothing

if it werent for greed intolerance hate passion and murder you would have no works of art no great buildings no medical science no mozart no van gough no muppets and no louis armstrong

i would request that my body in death be buried not cremated so that the energy content contained within it gets returned to the earth so that flora and fauna can dine upon it just as i have dined upon flora and fauna during my lifetime

not only is the universe stranger than we think it is stranger than we can think

in questions of science the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual

the basic trouble you see is that people think that right and wrong are absolute that everything that isnt perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong

however i dont think thats so it seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts and i will devote this essay to an explanation of why i think so

when my friend the english literature expert tells me that in every century scientists think they have worked out the universe and are always wrong what i want to know is how wrong are they are they always wrong to the same degree

watney look a pair of boobs  y

magics just science that we dont understand yet

there’s as many atoms in a single molecule of your dna as there are stars in the typical galaxy we are each of us a little universe

i would rather have questions that cant be answered than answers that cant be questioned

millions saw the apple fall newton was the only one who asked why

we are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible because only in that way can we find progress

if the bee disappeared off the face of the earth man would only have four years left to live

science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge

there are in fact two things science and opinion the former begets knowledge the latter ignorance

if you thought that science was certain  well that is just an error on your part

it is a slightly arresting notion that if you were to pick yourself apart with tweezers one atom at a time you would produce a mound of fine atomic dust none of which had ever been alive but all of which had once been you

it is a curious situation that the sea from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life but the sea though changed in a sinister way will continue to exist the threat is rather to life itself

a straight line is not the shortest distance between two points

extinction is the rule survival is the exception

gravity explains the motions of the planets but it cannot explain who sets the planets in motion

you cannot reason people out of a position that they did not reason themselves into

the bounties of space of infinite outwardness were three empty heroics low comedy and pointless death

it is harder to crack prejudice than an atom

god is an everreceding pocket of﻿ scientific ignorance

when my information changes i alter my conclusions what do you do sir

philosophy  is a science and as such has no articles of faith accordingly in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions

to surrender to ignorance and call it god has always been premature and it remains premature today

there is a fundamental difference between religion which is based on authority and science which is based on observation and reason science will win because it works

by all means lets be openminded but not so openminded that our brains drop out

a foolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth

muirs home address as inscribed on the inside front cover of his first field journal

science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition

human science fragments everything in order to understand it kills everything in order to examine it

jokes of the proper kind properly told can do more to enlighten questions of politics philosophy and literature than any number of dull arguments

i have made a ceaseless effort not to ridicule not to bewail not to scorn human actions but to understand them

wonder is the seed of knowledge

miracles are not contrary to nature but only contrary to what we know about nature

i know that the molecules in my body are traceable to phenomena in the cosmos that makes me want to grab people on the street and say ‘have you heard this

we can only see a short distance ahead but we can see plenty there that needs to be done

the human spirit must prevail over technology

no amount of experimentation can ever prove me right a single experiment can prove me wrong

what i have denied and what my reason compels me to deny is the existence of a being throned above us as a god directing our mundane affairs in detail regarding us as individuals punishing us rewarding us as human judges might

science is a bit like the joke about the drunk who is looking under a lamppost for a key that he has lost on the other side of the street because thats where the light is it has no other choice

the aim of science is not to open the door to infinite wisdom but to set a limit to infinite error

a process cannot be understood by stopping it understanding must move with the flow of the process must join it and flow with it

the downside of my celebrity is that i cannot go anywhere in the world without being recognized it is not enough for me to wear dark sunglasses and a wig the wheelchair gives me away

jasnah had once defined a fool as a person who ignored information because it disagreed with desired results

science may be described as the art of systematic oversimplification

rain slowly slides down the glass as if the night is crying

even if the open windows of science at first make us shiver after the cozy indoor warmth of traditional humanizing myths in the end the fresh air brings vigor and the great spaces have a splendor of their own

it is often stated that of all the theories proposed in this century the silliest is quantum theory in fact some say that the only thing that quantum theory has going for it is that it is unquestionably correct

in our reasonings concerning matter of fact there are all imaginable degrees of assurance from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence a wise man therefore proportions his belief to the evidence

reality provides us with facts so romantic that imagination itself could add nothing to them

in the vastness of space and the immensity of time it is my joy to share a planet and an epoch with annie

dedication to sagans wife ann druyan in cosmos

in terms of doing things i take a fairly scientific approach to why things happen and how they happen i dont know if theres a god or not

halt you villains unhand that science

as to diseases make a habit of two things — to help or at least to do no harm

never apologize for burning too brightly or collapsing into yourself every night that is how galaxies are made

a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it

letter to roger c weightman on the anniversary of the signing of the declaration of independence in   june  this was jeffersons last letter

you can observe a lot just by watching

do not become someone else just because you are hurt be who you are  smile it may solve all problems you have got

invention is the most important product of mans creative brain the ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world the harnessing of human nature to human needs

science you dont know looks like magic

many of us saw religion as harmless nonsense beliefs might lack all supporting evidence but we thought if people needed a crutch for consolation wheres the harm september th changed all that

science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature and that is because in the last analysis we ourselves are a part of the mystery that we are trying to solve

but what about the end of the universe well miss the big moment

ive seen it its rubbish said zaphodnothing but a gnab gib

a what

opposite of a big bang come on lets get zappy

discovery is always rape of the natural world always

when scientifically investigating the natural world the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier

it turns out that an eerie type of chaos can lurk just behind a facade of order  and yet deep inside the chaos lurks an even eerier type of order

science is the process that takes us from confusion to understanding

science is like sex sometimes something useful comes out but that is not the reason we are doing it

if our brains were simple enough for us to understand them wed be so simple that we couldnt

we are survival machines – robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes this is a truth which still fills me with astonishment

we are stardust brought to life then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun

can you believe in god and evolution time magazine august

im not saying youre more intelligent than aristotle or wiser for all i know aristotles the cleverest person who ever lived thats not the point the point is only that science is cumulative and we live later

all sciences are vain and full of errors that are not born of experience the mother of all knowledge

we are all star stuff

thats the whole problem with science youve got a bunch of empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder

the earth is the only world known so far to harbor life there is nowhere else at least in the near future to which our species could migrate visit yes settle not yet like it or not for the moment the earth is where we make our stand

avoidable human misery is more often caused not so much by stupidity as by ignorance particularly our ignorance about ourselves

we feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered the problems of life have still not been touched at all

those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it

it has become almost a cliché to remark that nobody boasts of ignorance of literature but it is socially acceptable to boast ignorance of science and proudly claim incompetence in mathematics

philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds

the invisible and the nonexistent look very much alike

you know whats wrong with scientific power its a form of inherited wealth and you know what assholes congenitally rich people are

consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms for consciousness is absolutely fundamental it cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else

a blade of grass is a commonplace on earth it would be a miracle on mars our descendants on mars will know the value of a patch of green and if a blade of grass is priceless what is the value of a human being

remarks at the dinner for the americas cup crews september

equipped with his five senses man explores the universe around him and calls the adventure science

ignorance is hardly unusual miss davar the longer i live the more i come to realize that it is the natural state of the human mind there are many who will strive to defend its sanctity and then expect you to be impressed with their efforts

science is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making a tremendous fuss about its cleverness

we are star stuff which has taken its destiny into its own hands

nothing exists except atoms and empty space everything else is opinion

we are star stuff harvesting sunlight

every intelligent being whether it breathes or not coughs nervously at some time in its life

in a very real sense we have two minds one that thinks and one that feels

science my boy is made up of mistakes but they are mistakes which it is useful to make because they lead little by little to the truth

we understand more than we know

and a new philosophy emerged called quantum physics which suggest that the individual’s function is to inform and be informed you really exist only when you’re in a field sharing and exchanging information you create the realities you inhabit

history repeats but science reverberates

if we long for our planet to be important there is something we can do about it we make our world significant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers

but in my opinion all things in nature occur mathematically

the man of science has learned to believe in justification not by faith but by verification

one general law leading to the advancement of all organic beings namely multiply vary let the strongest live and the weakest die

faith and science i have learned are two sides of the same coin separated by an expanse so small but wide enough that one side cant see the other they dont know they are connected

it doesnt matter how beautiful your theory is it doesnt matter how smart you are if it doesnt agree with experiment its wrong

energy is liberated matter matter is energy waiting to happen

a real scientist solves problems not wails that they are unsolvable

if time be judiciously employed there is time for everything

science adjusts its views based on whats observed

faith is the denial of observation so that belief can be preserved

kids are never the problem they are born scientists the problem is always the adults they beat the curiosity out of kids they outnumber kids they vote they wield resources thats why my public focus is primarily adults

there is nothing which can better deserve our patronage than the promotion of science and literature knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness

this most beautiful system of the sun planets and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being

this being governs all things not as the soul of the world but as lord over all and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called lord god παντοκρατωρ or universal ruler

we have become by the power of a glorious evolutionary accident called intelligence the stewards of lifes continuity on earth we did not ask for this role but we cannot abjure it we may not be suited to it but here we are

the universe is not only queerer than we suppose but queerer than we can suppose

in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth

mother nature doesnt care if youre having fun

when a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly right when he states that something is impossible he is very probably wrong

science is based on experiment on a willingness to challenge old dogma on an openness to see the universe as it really is accordingly science sometimes requires courage  at the very least the courage to question the conventional wisdom

my dear kepler what would you say of the learned here who replete with the pertinacity of the asp have steadfastly refused to cast a glance through the telescope what shall we make of this shall we laugh or shall we cry

the scientist only imposes two things namely truth and sincerity imposes them upon himself and upon other scientists

even those who do not or cannot avail themselves of a scientific education choose to benefit from the technology that is made possible by the scientific education of others

for someone whoe smarter than a supercomputer sometimes youre a real idiot

islam expect every muslim to do this duty and if we realise our responsibility time will come soon when we shall justify ourselves worthy of a glorious past

he who hears the rippling of rivers in these degenerate days will not utterly despair

life is and will ever remain an equation incapable of solution but it contains certain known factors

for a successful technology reality must take precedence over public relations for nature cannot be fooled

whenever a theory appears to you as the only possible one take this as a sign that you have neither understood the theory nor the problem which it was intended to solve

when i heard the learn’d astronomer

when the proofs the figures were ranged in columns before me

when i was shown the charts and the diagrams to add divide and measure them

when i sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the

look’d up in perfect silence at the stars

my conversation with nasa about the water reclaimer was boring and riddled with technical details so ill paraphrase for you

it is very expensive to give bad medical care to poor people in a rich country

almost everything that distinguishes the modern world from earlier centuries is attibutable to science which achieved its most spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth century

measure what can be measured and make measurable what cannot be measured

a scientist can pretend that his work isnt himself its merely the impersonal truth an artist cant hide behind the truth he cant hide anywhere

it is not the possession of truth but the success which attends the seeking after it that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him

im dark matter the universe inside of me is full of something and science cant even shine a light on it i feel like im mostly made of mysteries

science teaches to think but love teaches to smile

my dream is to dream a dream

the real question is not whether machines think but whether men do the mystery which surrounds a thinking machine already surrounds a thinking man

so the story of man runs in a dreary circle because he is not yet master of the earth that holds him

the aim of science is to discover and illuminate truth and that i take it is the aim of literature whether biography or history it seems to me then that there can be no separate literature of science

we are built to be effective animals not happy ones

when in doubt c

men love to wonder and that is the seed of science

everything existing in the universe is the fruit of chance and necessity

to know the history of science is to recognize the mortality of any claim to universal truth

the capacity to blunder slightly is the real marvel of dna without this special attribute we would still be anaerobic bacteria and there would be no music

instead of reality being passively recorded by the brain it is actively constructed by it

nature composes some of her loveliest poems for the microscope and the telescope

and what greater might do we possess as human beings than our capacity to question and to learn

if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications my theory would absolutely break down but i can find no such case

it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data

it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree  make sure you understand the fundamental principles ie the trunk and big branches before you get into the leavesdetails or there is nothing for them to hang on to

the way to find out about our place in the universe is by examining the universe and by examining ourselves  without preconceptions with as unbiased a mind as we can muster

dna neither cares nor knows dna just is and we dance to its music

a person who has been punished is not thereby simply less inclined to behave in a given way at best he learns how to avoid punishment

my mind tells me ill never understand god

my heart tells me im not meant to

i think that modern physics has definitely decided in favor of plato in fact the smallest units of matter are not physical objects in the ordinary sense they are forms ideas which can be expressed unambiguously only in mathematical language

the previous sentence makes sense that is not the problem

this is

read it through again and youll get it

when a religious couple wrote to sagan about fulfilled prophecies he wrote back in may

if ‘fulfilled prophecy’ is your criterion why do you not believe in materialistic science which has an unparalleled record of fulfilled prophecy consider for example eclipses

i salute your fireside with best wishes and best affections for their health wealth and prosperity

letter to thomas jefferson  january

to worship a sacred mystery was just to worship your own ignorance

the maxims of medicine

before you examine the body of a patient

be patient to learn his story

for once you learn his story

you will also come to know

his body

before you diagnose any sickness

make sure there is no sickness in the mind or heart

for the emotions in a man’s moon or sun

can point to the sickness in

any one of his other parts

before you treat a man with a condition

know that not all cures can heal all people

for the chemistry that works on one patient

may not work for the next

because even medicine has its own

before asserting a prognosis on any patient

always be objective and never subjective

for telling a man that he will win the treasure of life

but then later discovering that he will lose

will harm him more than by telling him

that he may lose

but then he wins

the maxims of medicine by suzy kassem

no gods or kings only man andrew ryan

science is what you know philosophy is what you dont know

speech accepting the john burroughs medal

we are biology we are reminded of this at the beginning and the end at birth and at death in between we do what we can to forget

nature and natures laws lay hid in night

god said let newton be and all was light

the whole value of solitude depends upon oneself it may be a sanctuary or a prison a haven of repose or a place of punishment a heaven or a hell as we ourselves make it

the easiest way to do anything is properly

i believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted

something deeply hidden had to be behind things

science is the ultimate pornography analytic activity whose main aim is to isolate objects or events from their contexts in time and space this obsession with the specific activity of quantified functions is what science shares with pornography

the glory of science is that it is freeing the soul  breaking the mental manacles  getting the brain out of bondage  giving courage to thought  filling the world with mercy justice and joy

reality is you know the tip of an iceberg of irrationality that weve managed to drag ourselves up onto for a few panting moments before we slip back into the sea of the unreal

what we call rational grounds for our beliefs are often extremely irrational attempts to justify our instincts

those who are enslaved to their sects are not merely devoid of all sound knowledge but they will not even stop to learn

i am not afraid of a person who knows  kicks but i am afraid of a person who knows one kick but practices it for  times

emotional states are fairly quick bursts of neuronal gossip traits on the other hand are more like the neuronal equivalent of committed relationships

beyond all sciences philosophies theologies and histories a childs relentless inquiry is truly all it takes to remind us that we dont know as much as we think we know

in the battle that is philosophy all the techniques of war including looting and camouflage are permissible

the physician must be able to tell the antecedents know the present and foretell the future — must mediate these things and have two special objects in view with regard to disease namely to do good or to do no harm

science is observing truth in the light of head religion is observing truth in the light of heart humanity is using both the lights and education is developing that humanity

my view is that if your philosophy is not unsettled daily then you are blind to all the universe has to offer

once there was a boy said jace

of course for a moment a bleak amusement colored his voice then it was gone when the boy was six years old his father gave him a falcon to train falcons are raptors – killing birds his father told him the shadowhunters of the sky

as cities grow and technology takes over the world belief and imagination fade away and so do we

every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination

and

born from

poetry by suzy kassem

they keep saying that sea levels are rising an all this its nowt to do with the icebergs melting its because theres too many fish in it get rid of some of the fish and the water will drop simple basic science

science like life feeds on its own decay new facts burst old rules then newly divined conceptions bind old and new together into a reconciling law

most institutions demand unqualified faith but the institution of science makes skepticism a virtue

you are a placebo responder your body plays tricks on your mind you cannot be trusted

be sceptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence dont take anything for granted but heres the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and were not that good at doing that

it is difficult to say what is impossible for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow

if we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us that we are the reason there is a universe does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits

einstein said that if quantum mechanics were correct then the world would be crazy einstein was right  the world is crazy

letter to fellow revolutionary astronomer johannes kepelr

the labours of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind

by looking far out into space we are also looking far back into time back toward the horizon of the universe back toward the epoch of the big bang

we pledge to fight bluesky thinking wherever we find it life would be dull if we had to look up at cloudless monotony day after day

why i cant help wondering is god thought to need such ferocious

defence one might have supposed him amply capable of looking

after himself

before it is science and career before it is livelihood before even it is family or love freedom is sound sleep and safety to notice the play of morning sun

every mystery ever solved had been a puzzle from the dawn of the human species right up until someone solved it

it would be better for us to have some doubts in an honest pursuit of truth than it would be for us to be certain about something that was not true

science and technology multiply around us to an increasing extent they dictate the languages in which we speak and think either we use those languages or we remain mute

i guess im just an old mad scientist at bottom give me an underground laboratory half a dozen atomsmashers and a beautiful girl in a diaphanous veil waiting to be turned into a chimpanzee and i care not who writes the nations laws

we see that science is eminently perfectible and that each theory has constantly to give way to a fresh one

the is a secret for greater selfcontrol the science points to one thing the power of paying attention

it is not my intention to be fulsome but i confess that i covet your skull

there are no forbidden questions in science no matters too sensitive or delicate to be probed no sacred truths

knowledge is really confined to experience the laws of nature are as kant said the laws of our minds and as huxley said the generalization of observed facts

this is not the special pleading of a professed magician it boils down to the advice not to judge subjects of which you are perfectly ignorant and is to be found stated in clearer and lovelier language in the essays of thomas henry huxley

it is not clear that intelligence has any longterm survival value

a human being weighing  kilograms contains among other things

enough chalk to whiten a chicken pen

enough fat to make approximately  bars of soap

enough iron to make a two inch nail

i weigh more than  kilograms

he didn’t succeed

we cant help it life looks for life

civilization exists by geological consent subject to change without notice

there are no gods no nations no money and no human rights except in our collective imagination

i expressed these ideas long before the behaviorists led by pavlov in russia and by watson in the united states proclaimed their new psychology this apparently mechanistic conception is not antagonistic to an ethical conception of life

the theory of evolution has more holes in it than a dam made out of swiss cheese

the truth is more magical  in the best and most exciting sense of the word  than any myth or madeup mystery or miracle science has its own magic the magic of reality

the measure of greatness in a scientific idea is the extent to which it stimulates thought and opens up new lines of research

the mentally disturbed do not employ the principle of scientific parsimony the most simple theory to explain a given set of facts they shoot for the baroque

while the scientist sees everything that happens in one point of space

the poet feels everything that happens in one point of time

never fire a laser at a mirror

the paper does not provide the exact number of penises eaten by ducks but the author says there have been enough over the years to prompt the coining of a popular saying i better get home or the ducks will have something to eat

without a constant misuse of language there cannot be any discovery any progress

these mysteries about how we evolved should not distract us from the indisputable fact that we did evolve

all that was required to measure the planet was a man with a stick and a brain in other words couple an intellect with some experimental apparatus and almost anything seems achievable

electricity was a reality in the universe when moses led the children of israel out of the land of egypt this is true of all natural laws they have always existed but only when understood may they be used

were you there

if youve got the truth you can demonstrate it talking doesnt prove it

thinking only begins at the point where we have come to know that reason glorified for centuries is the most obstinate adversary of thinking

ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants we know more about war than we know about peace more about killing than we know about living we have grasped the mystery of the atom and rejected the sermon on the mount

nothing is too wonderful to be true if it be consistent with the laws of nature

there are many sources of spirituality religion may be the most common but it is by no means the only anything that generates a sense of awe may be a source of spirituality science does this in spades

the whole war between the atheist and the theist comes down to this the atheist believes a what created the universe the theist believes a who created the universe

freaks become norms and norms become extinct monster by monster evolution advanced

geometry has two great treasures one is the theorem of pythagoras the other the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio the first we may compare to a measure of gold the second we may name a precious jewel

in my experience the most staunchly held views are based on ignorance or accepted dogma not carefully considered accumulations of facts the more you expose the intricacies and realtities of the situation the less clearcut things become

i didnt want a world in which i had to choose between blind human babies and tortured monkey ones to be frank thats the sort of choice i expect science to protect me from not give me

the fossil record implies trial and error the inability to anticipate the future features inconsistent with a great designer though not a designer of a more remote and indirect temperament

first anyone who seriously intends to become a philosopher

must once in his life withdraw into himself and attempt

within himself to overthrow and build anew all the sciences

that up to then he has been accepting philosophy wisdom

sagesse is the philosophizers quite personal affair it must

arise as his wisdom as his selfacquired knowledge tending

toward universality a knowledge for which he can answer from

the beginning and at each step by virtue of his own absolute

the thing is its very dangerous to have a fixed idea a person with a fixed idea will always find some way of convincing himself in the end that he is right

the biggest battle is the war against ignorance

science is not separate from politics as much as i would like it to be a pure thing existing only in some intellectual realm unsullied by human struggle it will always be entangled with the world we live in

these are lines from my asteroidimpact novel regolith

just because there are no laws against stupidity doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be punished

i haven’t faced rejection this brutal since i was single

he smelled trouble like a fart in the shower

if this was a kiss of gratitude then she must have been very grateful

not since bush and cheney have so few spent so much so fast for so long for so little

as a nympho for mindfucks lisa took to politics like a pig to mud

she began paying men compliments as if she expected a receipt

like the aerosmith song his getupandgo just gotupandwent

you couldn’t beat the crap out of a dirty diaper

he embraced his only daughter as if she was deploying to iraq

she was hotter than a class  solar flare

if sex was a weapon then monique possessed wmd

i haven’t felt this alive since i lost my virginity

he once read that  of women fake organism and the rest are gay

beauty may be in the eyes of the beholder but ugly is universal

why do wives fart but not girlfriends

adultery is sex that is wrong but not necessarily bad

the dinosaurs stayed drugged out drooling like jonas brothers fans

silence filled the room like tear gas

the told him a fraction of the truth and hoped it would take just a fraction of the time

happiness is the best cosmetic

he was a whale of a catch and there were a lot of fish in the sea eager to nibble on his bait

cheap hookers are less buck for the bang

men cannot fall in love with women they don’t find attractive and women cannot fall in love with men they do not respect

cooper looked like a cow about to be tipped over

his father warned him to never do anything he couldn’t justify on oprah

the poor are not free  they’re just not enslaved only those with money are free

sperm wasn’t something he would choose on a menu but it still tasted better than asparagus

the crater looked alive like godzilla was about to leap out and mess up tokyo

bush follows the bible until it gets to jesus

when bush talks to god it’s prayer when god talks to bush it’s policy

cheney called the new miss america a traitor – apparently she wished for world peace

cheney was so unpopular that bush almost replaced him when running for reelection changing his campaign slogan to ‘ain’t got dick’

bush fought a war on poverty – and the poor lost

bush thinks we should strengthen the dollar by making it twoply

hurricane katrina got rid of so many democratic voters that republicans have started calling her kathleen harris

america and iraq fought a war and iran won

bush hasn’t choked this much since his last pretzel

some wars are unpopular the rest are victorious

so many conservatives hate the gop that they are thinking of changing their name to the dixie chicks

if saddam had any wmd he would have used them when we invaded if bush had any brains he would have used them when we invaded

it’s hard for bush to win hearts and minds since he has neither

in iraq you are a coward if you leave and a fool if you stay

bush believes it’s not a sin to kill muslims since they are going to hell anyway and with bush’s help soon

in iraq those who make their constitution subservient to their religion are called muslims in america they’re called republicans

with great power comes great responsibility – unless you’re republican

revere those things beyond science which really matter and about which it is so difficult to speak

i believe in evolution in the sense that a shorttempered man is the successor of a crybaby

maybe if i had to boil it down to one easy sentence it would be this i believe in evolution and i believe in god i just havent worked out the details yet

it was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life it was almost as incredible as if you fired a inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you

it is not a matter of whether one is biased or not it is really a question of which bias is the best bias with which to be biased

bad times have a scientific value these are occasions a good learner would not miss

i regard the afterlife to be a fairy story for people that are afraid of the dark

we shall never achieve harmony with the land anymore than we shall achieve absolute justice or liberty for people in these higher aspirations the important thing is not to achieve but to strive

discovery consists of looking at the same thing as everyone else and thinking something different

when a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly right when he states that something is impossible he is very probably wrong

the only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible

any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic

words too have genuine substance  mass and weight and specific gravity

there is a certain seductiveness about dead things you can ill treat alter and recolour whats dead it won’t complain

that feed on their velocity

and little whirls have lesser whirls

and so on to viscosity

once we lose our fear of being tiny we find ourselves on the threshold of a vast and awesome universe which dwarfs  in time in space and in potential  the tidy anthropocentric proscenium of our ancestors

we are not born into the world we are born into something that we make into the world

its the fate of all creators they fall in love with their creations

indubitably magick is one of the subtlest and most difficult of the sciences and arts there is more opportunity for errors of comprehension judgement and practice than in any other branch of physics

all killer whales are named kevin you knew that right

science fiction any scientific acclaim that omits god

science doesnt tell us what we should do it only tells us what is

the best scientist is open to experience and begins with romance  the idea that anything is possible

if youve done  impossible things this morning why not round it off with breakfast at milliways the restaurant at the end of the universe

he wrested the worlds whereabouts from the stars and locked the secret in a pocket watch

a little philosophy inclineth mans mind to atheism but depth in philosophy bringeth mens minds about to religion

order is heavens first law

the secrets of evolution are time and death

theres an unbroken thread that stretches from those first cells to us

theres something in science like the shine of the patronus charm driving back all sorts of darkness and madness

science must not impose any philosophy any more than the telephone must tell us what to say

in practical life we are compelled to follow what is most probable  in speculative thought we are compelled to follow truth

the curious mind embraces science the gifted and sensitive the arts the practical business the leftover becomes an economist

stop telling god what to do with his dice

the essence of science is that it is always willing to abandon a given idea for a better one the essence of theology is that it holds its truths to be eternal and immutable

scientific principles and laws do not lie on the surface of nature they are hidden and must be wrested from nature by an active and elaborate technique of inquiry

man moves in a world that is nothing more or less than his consciousness objectified–neville goddard

skepticism is the agent of reason against organized irrationalismand is therefore one of the keys to human social and civic decency

i await your sentence with less fear than you pass it the time will come when all will see what i see

in a manner of speaking as we intend for you to found a dynasty and that dynasty will rule society until it has progressed enough to

overthrow the dynasty in a revolutionary blood filled coup iggy said eagerly

we all looked at him

just saying he sheepishly took a bite of cookie

the greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function

nothing great is ever accomplished by following standards

you will never get to the irreducible definition of anything because you will never be able to explain why you want to explain and so on the system will gobble itself up

science is the topography of ignorance

since the beginning of time spirituality and religion have been called to fill in the gaps that science did not understand

…our sunsets have been reduced to wavelengths and frequencies the complexities of the universe have been shredded into mathematical equations even our selfworth as human beings has been destroyed

please dont die

the alternative to thinking in evolutionary terms is not to think at all

it is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used

describing in  the value to astronomers of the handcranked calculating machine he had invented in

in one word to draw the rule from experience one must generalize this is a necessity that imposes itself on the most circumspect observer

above all do not attempt to use science i mean the real sciences as a defence against christianity they will positively encourage him to think about realities he can’t touch and see

the significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which we created them

numbers do not feel do not bleed or weep or hope they do not know bravery or sacrifice love and allegiance at the very apex of callousness you will find only ones and zeros

do those people who hold up the bible as an inspiration to

moral rectitude have the slightest notion of what is actually written

in it

your beliefs dont make you a better person your behavior does

napoleon when hearing about laplaces latest book said m laplace they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe and have never even mentioned its creator

laplace responds je navais pas besoin de cette hypothèselà i had no need of that hypothesis

no one infers a god from the simple from the known from what is understood but from the complex from the unknown and incomprehensible our ignorance is god what we know is science

he who replies to words of doubt

doth put the light of knowledge out

names and attributes must be accommodated to the essence of things and not the essence to the names since things come first and names afterwards

within sixtyminute limits or onehundredyard limits or the limits of a game board we can look for perfect moments or perfect structures in my fiction i think this search sometimes turns out to be a cruel delusion

no optimism no pessimism no homesickness for lost values or for the way fiction used to be written

discarded pages mark the physical dimensions of a writer’s labor

every new novel stretches the term of the contract—let me live long enough to do one more book

you become a serious novelist by living long enough

lord grant that my work increase knowledge and help other men failing that lord grant that it will not lead to man’s destruction failing that lord grant that my article in brain be published before the destruction takes place

in conclusion it appears that nothing can be more improving to a young naturalist than a journey in distant countries

science like art is not a copy of nature but a recreation of her

psychology is sometimes called a new science this is quite wrong psychology is perhaps the oldest science and unfortunately in its most essential features a forgotten science

dna is like a computer program but far far more advanced than any software ever created

science without conscience is the souls perdition

a nation that cant control its energy sources cant control its future

science is as corruptible a human activity as any other

it is not what the man of science believes that distinguishes him but how and why he believes it his beliefs are tentative not dogmatic they are based on evidence not on authority or intuition

all the tales of miracles with which the old and new testament are filled are fit only for impostors to preach and fools to believe

when things get too complicated it sometimes makes sense to stop and wonder have i asked the right question

i do not like odd things until i can understand them

the european talks of progress because by the aid of a few scientific discoveries he has established a society which has mistaken comfort for civilisation

i think we have different value systems —arthur

you can get into a habit of thought in which you enjoy making fun of all those other people who dont see things as clearly as you do we have to guard carefully against it

the assumption of an absolute determinism is the essential foundation of every scientific enquiry

science is a firstrate piece of furniture for a mans upper chamber if he has common sense on the ground floor

i will argue that every scrap of biological diversity is priceless to be learned and cherished and never to be surrendered without a struggle

it is our task both in science and in society at large to prove the conventional wisdom wrong and to make our unpredictable dreams come true

from the scientific view the theory of karma may be a metaphysical assumption  but it is no more so than the assumption that all of life is material and originated out of pure chance

after all what else is scientific enquiry of any sort other than a controlled version of banging ones head against the universe until something gives

nothing in the universe can travel at the speed of light they say forgetful of the shadows speed

in gods eyes walking on water is no more miraculous than the ability of hemoglobin to bond with oxygen inside a red blood corpuscle

faced with an exciting question science tended to provide the dullest possible answer

the question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself and without losing the right to be called civilized

nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate that there are no mysteries in nature that our triumphs are complete and that there are no new worlds to conquer

it is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful they are found because it was possible to find them

my lack of faith in god is not a dilapidated house

it does not need to be razed to the ground or burned down to cinders

i refuse to be the wounded woman on a cross

that you crucify with your disapproval like nails

i will only be the woman who believes in thunderstorms

the same way lightning loves the tops of trees it strikes

every time it gets tired of being pent up in an unforgiving sky

the only difference is that i believe these are natural weather phenomenons

not god’s belly rumbling or synapses firing

when my doorway is filled with groups of people

i will be the martyr who steps aside to let the arrows

crack through the plaster in my wall instead of piercing my chest

this is not a eulogy to the believer i could have been

this is a battle cry to the believer i always have been

after old nights spent drowning in despair believer

in love as an entire language instead of a single word

just because my beliefs align themselves on a different spectrum

does not mean they are the wrong wavelength or color

and even though i think the universe was created by the big bang

instead of a god with magic dust shooting from his fingertips

my universe does not contain fewer stars

the truth of our faith becomes a matter of ridicule among the infidels if any catholic not gifted with the necessary scientific learning presents as dogma what scientific scrutiny shows to be false

this mindless tolerance which places observable scientific facts subject to proof on the same level as unprovable supernatural fantasy has played a major role in the resurgence of both antiintellectualism and antirationalism

nobody is driven by abstractions like seeking truth

nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution

one of the great achievements of science has been if not to make it impossible for intelligent people to be religious then at least to make it possible for them not to be religious we should not retreat from this accomplishment

there are no things man was not meant to know there are perhaps things man is too dumb to figure out but thats a different problem

in a nutshell the universe is  visible  undetectable and  unimaginable welcome to the cosmos full of mass you can measure but not manhandle driven by a force you can infer but not explain

the universe is a labyrinth made of labyrinths each leads to another and wherever we cannot go ourselves we reach with mathematics out of mathematics we build wagons to carry us into the nonhuman realms of the world

they are ill discoverers that think there is no land when they can see nothing but sea

love is a chemical reaction

but it cannot be fully understood or defined by science

and though a body cannot exist without a soul

it too cannot be fully understood or defined by science

love is the most powerful form of energy

but science cannot decipher its elements

yet the best cure for a sick soul is love

but even the most advanced physician

cannot prescribe it as medicine

incomplete science by suzy kassem

us versus them is not in our genes it is something we learn

science only goes so far then comes god

it is interesting to note how many of the great scientific discoveries begin as myths

thus as far as he is a scientific man as far as he knows anything he is a materialist outside his science in spheres about which he knows nothing he translates his ignorance into greek and calls it agnosticism

knowledge absolutely sure of its infallibility is faith

if you see an antimatter version of yourself running towards you think twice before embracing

an experiment is a question which science poses to nature and a measurement is the recording of natures answer

see now the power of truth the same experiment which at first glance seemed to show one thing when more carefully examined assures us of the contrary

in every man there is a child in every woman there is a mother

the mind is a neural computer

we should never wait for science to give us permission to do the uncommon if we do then we are turning science into another religion

the scientific method thomas henry huxley once wrote is nothing but the normal working of the human mind that is to say when the mind is working that is to say further when it is engaged in corrrecting its mistakes

taking this point of view we may conclude that science is not physics biology or chemistryis not even a subjectbut a moral imperative drawn from a larger narrative whose purpose is to give perspective balance and humility to learning

an ocean traveler has even more vividly the impression that the ocean is made of waves than that it is made of water

these dates are incorrect

medieval jewish scholars put the date of the creation at bc greek orthodox theologians put creation as far back as bc

these suggestions are also incorrect

this too was incorrect by almost a quarter of an hour

the whole business with the fossilized dinosaur skeletons was a joke the paleontologists havent seen yet

it is not some metatheory at whose feet every point of view from astrology to acupressure to channeling need be laid to have the hand of science announce thumbs up or thumbs down

none of the people have any real interest in a science who only begin to be enthusiastic about it when they themselves have made discoveries in it

when asked by a student if he believes in any gods

oh no absolutely not the biggest advantage to believing in god is you dont have to understand anything no physics no biology i wanted to understand

for scientists reality is not optional

we long for permanence but everything in the known universe is transient that’s a fact but one we fight

to say that the first casualty of war is truth is to miss the rather more important point that a principal weapon of war is lies

i have no responsibility to live up to what others expect of me thats their mistake not my failing

science had to have some mystery otherwise everyone would find out how simple it was

not a single one of the cells that compose you knows who you are or cares

truth is the daughter of time and i feel no shame in being her midwife

there is no indisputable proof for the big bang said hollus and there is none for evolution and yet you accept those why hold the question of whether there is a creator to a higher standard

those who cannot remember the past are condemned to compute it

i used to measure the skies now i measure the shadows of earth

although my mind was skybound the shadow of my body lies here

epitaph he composed for himself a few months before he died

i am one of those who think like nobel that humanity will draw more good than evil from new discoveries

night clubs are where americans learn the laws of motion

consider the lichen lichens are just about the hardiest visible organisms on earth but the least ambitious

weve arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology we have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology this is a prescription for disaster

knowledge is like an endless resource a well of water that satisfies the innate thirst of the growing human soul therefore never stop learning because the day you do you will also stop maturing

sure at some level scientists know nanobots will destroy mankind they just cant resist seeing how it happens

i know lsd i dont need to take it anymore maybe when i die like aldous huxley

perhaps eggs are like neurons which also are not replenished in adulthood they know too much eggs must plan the party sperm need only to show up wearing top hat and tails of course

when the words not enough to describe how much you love

even you know shehe dont anything for you

you cant fall a sleep exactly like befores

it’s so hard to balance in our minds the knowledge that ‘the world’ is mundanely ‘a planet’ the former is so holy the latter merely a science project

the real purpose of the scientific method is to make sure nature hasn’t misled you into thinking you know something you actually don’t know

whenever we proceed from the known into the unknown we may hope to understand but we may have to learn at the same time a new meaning of the word understanding

aristotle maintained that women have fewer teeth than men although he was twice married it never occurred to him to verify this statement by examining his wives mouths

if a rat is a good model for your emotional life youre in big trouble

a god who is capable of sending intelligible signals to millions of people simultaneously and of receiving messages from all of them simultaneously cannot be whatever else he might be simple such bandwidth

responding to the bishop of oxford samuel wilberforces question whether he traced his descent from an ape on his mothers or his fathers side

one possibility is god is nothing but the power of the universe to organize itself

understanding requires insight insight must be anchored

religions die when they are proved to be true science is the record of dead religions

impossibility only lasts until you find new unbelievable hard evidences

very well lets consider the objection i doubt that the defender of religion will find it attractive once we explore it carefully

its your serve

discover the force of the skies o men once recognised it can be put to use

my mind was formed by studying philosophy plato and that sort of thing

to err is human to persist in error is diabolical

sigmund freud was a novelist with a scientific background he just didn’t know he was a novelist all those damn psychiatrists after him they didn’t know he was a novelist either

interview in writers at work the paris review interviews eighth series ed george plimpton

wind is renewable turbines are not

i challenge you to find a more innocuous sentence containing the words sperm suction swallow and any homophone of seaman and then call me up on the homophone and read it to me

reason and free inquiry are the only effectual agents against error

they religions dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of daylight and scowl on the fatal harbinger announcing the subversions of the duperies on which they live

while the art of printing is left to us science can never be retrograde what is once acquired of real knowledge can never be lost

review of the evolving world evolution in everyday life nature    august

the important thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts as to discover new ways of thinking about them

there is very little of this crude weltanschauung that is not shared to some degree by the multitudes today especially among the young who feel themselves enlightened and liberated very little that is not typically modern

some people want just to sit back and watch the world burn

they have to say something maria bartiromo cant exactly look into the camera and say that the dow is down half a percent today because of random brownian motion

religion and science are paths of denial in the sense that a scientific statement should be one capable of being disproved while a religious statement should be capable of being disbelieved

the good thing about science is that its true whether or not you believe in it

as an uptodate russian progressive and contemptible petersburger it struck me as inexplicable that knowing so much they had for instance no science like our

ironically once he was safely dead bruno

was redefined as a martyr for science for

centuries historians quietly ignored the vast amount of occultism in his writing and insisted that he had been burned at the stake

for his belief that the earth circled the sun and there were an infinite number of habitable worlds in space only in the middle

years of the twentieth century when scholarly prejudices against occultism had begun to fade did the scope and depth of his occult involvements become clear

true our knowledge does grow but it is threatened by greater increases in confidence which make our increase in knowledge at the same time an increase in confusion ignorance and conceit

faith is life and knowledge is death

faith is to suspect something is there and knowledge is to encounter it

it is important that the masses realize that some aspects of science are blatantly crooked

critical thinking is an active and ongoing process it requires that we all think like bayesians updating our knowledge as new information comes in

if we can see the scientific viewpoint as one way of perceiving rather than as offering the only or superior truth then we can learn from these discoveries without shifting into a more mechanical viewpoint ourselves

recursion is a drag

the success of the scheme would depend on the fineness of the mark and the exactness of the measurement the slightest imprecision would cause whole libraries of alexandria to burn

the mauna kea observatories mko are a good example of what is wrong with science

no such thing as a false analogy exists an analogy can be more or less detailed and hence more or less informative

common sense doesnt always ring true for many people they want empirical evidence the scientific stuff

obstacles must not be placed in the way of pure and scientific research whatever the consequences may be the practical results do not matter what counts is the free and disinterested disinterested of the genius of man

in other words if a scientist blew up the whole earth or poisoned it to the core this would be a free and disinterested manifestation of the genius of man

he refused to join his questioner in taking such a pessimistic view scientific research must remain completely free from any consideration of possible practical consequences

it is science that brought light into the dark world of the mind

the purpose of science is not downscaling everything to physical level and measure but to penetrate deeper into the realm beyond the sensory perceptions and bring more indepth knowledge and wisdom to the world

the cosmos was discovered only yesterday

for a million years it was clear to everyone that there were no other places than the earth

then in the last tenth of a percent of the lifetime of our species in the instant between aristarchus and ourselves we reluctantly noticed that we were not the centre and purpose of the universe

but rather lived on a tiny and fragile world lost in immensity and eternity drifting in a great cosmic ocean dotted here and there with a hundred billion galaxies and a billion trillion stars

for centuries it was believed that disabled people like me were living under a curse that was inflicted by god i prefer to think that everything can be explained another way by the laws of nature

it follows that most people would very much like science to prove the existence of god but not to take the measure of his capacity

it is a sad state of affairs that the russians are far ahead of the usa in the science of the long term biological effects of electromagnetic radiation on a global population of over seven billion people

modern business people and lawyers are in fact powerful sorcerers

the most effective experimenters are usually those who give much thought to the problem beforehand and resolve it into crucial questions and then give much thought to designing experiments to answer the questions

we can only know the world through the senses that evolution has passed down to us that reality is therefore forever opaque to us

the mere formulation of a problem is far more essential than its solution to raise new questions new possibilities to regard old problems from a new angle requires creative imagination and marks real advances in science

in practice science is often guided by a search for unifying ideas that are as simple as possible and that connect many different observations with as few explanations as possible

it is the care we bestow on apparently trifling unatractive and very troublesome minutiae which determines the result

the absence of a decisive higher jury has long affected the battle between science and religion

it’s never too early to join the pursuit of science and never too late all species are welcome of course

science is the path a curious child would take when not told about anything

every moment is to be experienced with nothing but truth and devoted to the quest for it through the method of science

the ideal state of course is that when all the ‘what’ ‘when’ ‘why’ and ‘how’ questions have been answered correctly and the word ‘may’ has no meaning

why object to one very high altitude telescope when you can use science to object to them all

i want to make it clear to the high altitude astronomy community we are not friends

poison my team and i will hunt you down with science

we were not aware of how autonomous cars could go wrong but once the science behind the technology is implemented in real life the issues with it became an engineering problem slowly we learn about all the things that could go wrong

i spend most of my time with my friend called failure and i really enjoy it when my best friend called discovery drops by for an occasional visit

i am blowing the whistle on high altitude astronomy because it is well overdue

there is only so much abuse a worker will take before they decide to shut your biologically toxic operation down with legal science

the simplest way to shut down a known biologically toxic facility is to trawl the internet for scientific papers that prove the toxicity

i always suspected that improvements in health would come from researching the biological toxicity of high altitude to the sea level adapted human

do we ever know the truth about our reality with all these logical assumptions which are based upon a grand stack of other logical assumptions

there is not the durability of all these logical assumptions

astronomy needs to clean up its act and the first step in the right direction is the demolition of the biologically toxic mauna kea observatories

the biologically toxic electromagnetic cover up is one of the most destructive actions that modern governments are engaging in

research is turning the unknown into reality

biological science is clear that the mauna kea observatories must be shut down to protect the long term health of the summit workers it will be interesting to see how long astronomers willfully ignore the science

the w m keck observatory is the only employer that has surprise drug tested me during my employment

if someone tells you that something is impossible and you believe them you should probably not be a researcher

the internet has enabled research that was previously done over the lifetime of a large group of researchers to be done in just a few years by a single person

religion is the symbolic andor ritualized cultural system of knowledge which informs behavior that offers one means of surviving this complex thing we call ‘life’

research is like swimming if you stop swimming you will never make it to the other side if you stop researching you will never make it to discovery

one of the most useful skills advocates can develop is a sincere satisfaction in changing their mind putting the goal of effectiveness before the goal of having been correct

to observe processes and construct means is science to criticize and coordinate ends is philosophy

science gives us knowledge but only philosophy can give us wisdom

thus physics and astronomy relegated our world to a corner of the cosmos and biology shifted our status from a simulacrum of god to a naked upright ape

the sad truth is that politics corrupts science as well as religion

since i am neither a neurologist nor a psychiatrist but a mathematician the work that follows requires some explanation and justification

in an analog machine each number is represented by a suitable physical quantity whose values measured in some preassigned unit is equal to the number in question

any computing machine that is to solve a complex mathematical problem must be programmed for this task this means that the complex operation of solving that problem must be replaced by a combination of the basic operations of the machine

thus all sorts of sophisticated ordersystems become possible which keep successively modifying themselves and hence also the computational processes that are likewise under their control

we do not know where in the physically viewed nervous system a memory resides we do not know whether it is a separate organ or a collection of specific parts of other already known organs etc

being antiracist is not simply political correctness it is proven science

marketing is the marriage of business and creativity the relationship is enhanced by the occasional affair with science

it is a common illusion to believe that what we know today is all we ever can know nothing is more vulnerable than scientific theory which is an ephemeral attempt to explain facts and not an everlasting truth in itself

art must pass the test of time science must fail it for the world it tries to understand keeps changing

science does a great job at reducing variables until they are small enough to be understood but we arent doing a great job at reassembling the picture once it has been broken down into a thousand pieces

we need not know the how and the why to profit from knowing the that

only art and science can raise men to the level of gods

knowing how a computer came into existence is not as important as what brought it into existence

the science that we are doing is a threat to the world’s most powerful and wealthiest special interests the most powerful and wealthiest special interest that has ever existed the fossil fuel industry

science has more questions than answers to any topic any answer entails more than one question therefore to be a scientist is to be ready to live with this suffering

because i am a female scientist nobody knows what the hell i am and it has given me the delicious freedom to make it up as i go along

numbers dont lie and neither does science chapter

the truth is almost every solid idea that comes from science is in some sense an abstraction rather than a real thing

you seldom learn the names of the truly wealthy and powerful you see only their spokesmen the political arena makes a few exceptions to this but does not reveal the full power structure

and the night never ends

human eyes have not yet reached as far as they can go with a telescope nor have they seen everything there is to see with a microscope

the process of science and natural laws don’t care about our politics or preconceptions they merely set the boundaries of what is possible defining the outer limits of what we can achieve  or not should we shy away from the challenge

data science is a combination of art and science limited only by the extent of freedom afforded the data scientist to explore coupled with their creative abilities

the chain is only as strong as its weakest link for if that fails the chain fails and the object that it has been holding up falls to the ground

it is very important for scientists to engage with the media – to ensure the public has access to accurate evidencebased scientific information to keep us everpresent in the minds of policy makers and funders and to inform public debate

in every chain of reasoning the evidence of the last conclusion can be no greater than that of the weakest link of the chain whatever may be the strength of the rest

the chain is only as strong as its weakest

link for if that fails the chain fails and the object that it has been holding up falls to the ground

to think wishfully to rest in comforting illusion when scientific truth is conceivably within reach is to desecrate both one’s self and the universe

hypotheses were constantly reaching out into the darkness – slowly almost inevitably refining and rectifying themselves through empirical contact with reality

science is the enemy of the certain

the classic predatorprey model

it begins with two equations one tracks the prey population which could be something like the number of bunnies in a forest the second follows the predator population which we could imagine as the number of wolves in the same forest

the important point for modelers to capture is that the two populations are tied together the wolves eat the bunnies and that changes the bunny population but eating bunnies lets the wolves reproduce adding to their population

so the bunny population affects the wolf population too in these linked equations there’s a part that describes how the bunnies get eaten by wolves and another that describes how the wolves have more babies by eating bunnies

eventually the bunny population peaks as the rapidly growing number of wolves starts having its impact after that the bunny numbers drop and they start to grow scarce

the wolf population however takes some time to feel the change only later do their numbers peak and then start dropping eventually the wolf population gets low enough for the bunnies to recover and the cycle begins anew

nothing puts a greater obstacle in the way of the progress of knowledge than thinking that one knows what one does not yet know

pace trial is a fault line between the way we did medicine secretive clubbable and the way we should do medicine transparent shared pace is turning out to be the science controversy of the decade it indicts the medical ecosystem of review

we celebrate our ability to create machines that move as man yet we take for granted the miracle that is the human body

life blindly breeds battles and slaughters its way up to mind and rationality

sometimes science was the closest thing to the sword of an avenging angel humanity was ever going to get

parsimony is always in the forefront of a scientists mind when choosing between theories but it isnt always obvious how to judge it

we dont usually see this happening but like detectives arriving on the scene after a crime we can piece together what must have happened from the evidence that remains

nothing that is in equilibrium can be alive

books are the carriers of civilization without books history is silent literature is dumb science is crippled thought and speculation at a standstill they are engines of change windows on the world lighthouses erected in the sea of time

okay guys this is epic

all religions nearly all philosophies and even a part of science testify to the unwearying heroic effort of mankind desperately denying its contingency

it is ill arguing against anything from its misuse

robin he chided her he wanted to tell her all this would happen to her too that her luck would turn as well but he had no good arguments for this and she had no reason to believe him such luck as his was far too rare

i hope it all works out she said looking up and then as if afraid to sound too stingy she added i’m sure it will

he bent down to kiss her but she turned away slightly and his lips brushed her ear as he whispered please be happy for me

a presbyterian minister recently said to me that science and religion share a sense of wonder i agree

a good poem is not true in the way a scientific fact is true a good poem is true in the way a mountain or a flower or a warm fire is true

at the present time we certainly do not know all the laws of nature and it is a good bet that most of our current formulations of those laws will be revised in the future

yet the great majority of scientists believe that a complete and final set of laws governing all physical phenomena exists and that we are making continual progress toward discovery of those laws

the deep question is why does nature embody so much symmetry we do not know the full answer to this question

however we have some partial answers symmetry leads to economy and nature like human beings seems to prefer economy

one physical principle that governs nature over and over is the energy principle nature evolves to minimize energy

i will put my cards on the table i am an atheist myself i completely endorse the central doctrine of science

i do not believe in the existence of a being who lives beyond matter and energy even if that being refrains from entering the fray of the physical world

however science is not the only avenue for arriving at knowledge there are interesting and vital questions beyond the reach of test tubes and equations

obviously vast territories of the arts concern inner experiences that cannot be analyzed by science the humanities such as history and philosophy raise questions that do not have definite or unanimously accepted answers

most religions including christianity judaism islam and hinduism subscribe to an interventionist view of god

all of these religions at least in their orthodox expressions are incompatible with science this is as far as one gets with a purely logical analysis

except for a god who sits down after the universe begins all other gods conflict with the assumptions of science

i have found that the more one studies nature the more one can see that it reveals gods personality to such an extent that many of the writings of even nonreligious scientists clearly declare gods power and majesty

when we understand how the big bang reveals the person and character of god we see him more clearly and this shows his glory majesty and wonder

the evidence for the beginning of the universe in the big bang has become so powerful and so convincing that scientists have accepted it as true even though the philosophical and theological implications may be repugnant to some

i use the word god in an impersonal sense like einstein did for the laws of nature so knowing the mind of god is knowing the laws of nature my prediction is that we will know the mind of god by the end of this century

unlike laws made by humans the laws of nature cannot be broken—that’s why they are so powerful and when seen from a religious standpoint controversial too

variety of opinion is necessary for objective knowledge

i am a scientist which means i dont have the luxury to talk nonsense if it cant pass the test of reasoning no matter how much it sounds philosophical or spiritual

in ordinary society superstition sells faster than science

the only limit to innovation is our own imagination

science technology engineering and math is still necessary to know if you dream of being a filmmaker filmmaking is an art form but with the use of stem  kailin gow

he was a fast and proficient chemist and so was i the shrink says she doesnt question that but what every scientist knows—you cant just be proficient you have to have insight

all the universe is full of the life of perfect creatures

people can cope with the chaos of change over the years that is with diachronic variation simply because they can cope with the even greater chaos of synchronic variation the diversity at any one point in time

the deeper a thing is the more interesting it is

there is more mental health cure found in a pile of dirt than in all the behavioral therapy and drugs in modern medical science

it is surely the following kinds of question that would need to be posed

that it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason – for then we would know the mind of god

science is the supreme expression of mans rationality

more than  of facts are not and will never be useful to even a single person

if we are made in his image how will that change in this next stage in our evolution where we have cloning of individuals and gene manipulation to enhance ourselves are we changing what that image is

we must respect that silence and make our decisions and judgments based upon science and fact and simple oldfashioned common sense  a commodity absent for too long from those in governmental elevatia where its employ would do us all much good

first stage of islamic scientific development was essentially an assimilation of imported knowledge and muslim scholars had only a secondary role to play as translators

technology has really helped me and has been a big part of my life so maybe that is why i am such a fan of science or maybe i just like to think about how things work and how i can make them work even better

you are trapped in your paradigm science advances one grave at a time

how dare they be so arrogant and presume only their medical methods are fit for public consumption and not those of a more naturalistic and naturopathic approach

sometimes at midnight i put on my lamp as to see success

love is an excessive sanity that leads to the madness that we deserve

in all forms of relationships  friendship is the only one facing  the battle alone

love is the only one that remains after lovers have gone separate ways

to conclude there is nothing in muslim mathematics which could be called islamic mathematics if there is a difference then that difference is simply that muslim civilization did better than any of the others for the  years of its golden age

often people run out of gas before they write the summary and conclusions this part of the paper or talk is what will remain uppermost in the readerslisteners mind

i want to know where this work leaves us i e the summary and where does it leas us i e what are the questions raised by this work i e the conclusions

the hanbalite ibn taymiya understood ilm knowledge as referring to that knowledge which derives from the prophet everything else he regarded either as useless or no science at all even though it might be called by that name

in a series of forms graduating insensibly from some apelike creature to man as he now exists it would be impossible to fix on any definite point where the term man ought to be used

science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom

but who can quantify

the algebra of space

or weigh those worlds that swim

each in its place

who can outdo the dark

and what computer knows

climate change and localized warning or cooling is the result of natural phenomena

we will explore the sacred relationships that exist between science religion and everything inbetween it is the inbetween territory that is oft overlooked seldom realized an area that terrifies religionists and scientists alike

people think of these eureka moments and my feeling is that they tend to be little things a little realization and then a little realization built on that

science has confirmed what athletes have always believed that theres more in there—if youre willing to believe it

earth is presently in a period of increasing heat released over time from many sources

when reading the works of an important thinker look first for the apparent absurdities in the text and ask yourself how a sensible person could have written them

if you want to make a name for yourself develop new branches of scientific study

co is neither a major contributor to climate change nor an environmental pollutant

in today’s climate it is considered to be rational and

science may have transformed the world into a global village but it has yet to teach the villagers to learn to talk with and understand each other

muslims – who comprise onefifth of all humanity  will continue to suffer an undignified and degraded existence if science and particularly a rational approach to human problems is considered alien to islamic culture

i find that a little bit of crazy is an essential ingredient of discovery

computers are ridiculous so is science in general churchturing thesis theodore rosak version

the insane human mind is the greatest scientific instrument known to mankind

in summary the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another

the first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool so you have to be very careful about that after you’ve not fooled yourself it’s easy not to fool other scientists

you just have to be honest in a conventional way after that

have faith that the results that you are looking for will come from the fruition of your research

when it comes to established environmental science president trump is like a bull in a china shop

the thing i like about scientific discovery is that you can truly change the world by uncovering the unknown

visions imagination curiosity and experience give rise to discovery

every living being is just as evolved as every other because every living thing has been shaped by evolution over the exact same period of time since life first evolved

so you may get homesick but youll never go hungry

when you look into the wide range of science on environmental radiation it is reasonable to conclude that there is an extensive corporate government conspiracy to radiation poison the global population

what would you do if i told you that corporations and corporate controlled governments invest heavily in corrupted science

the biggest thing that stephen hawking taught me is that an extremely sickly and sedentary person can live to the ripe old age of seventy six

i thought i know what it is theyre going to talk about mechanics how the springs work inside the toy about chemistry how the engine of an automobile works and biology about how the muscles work

it was the kind of thing my father would have talked about what makes it go everything goes because the sun is shining and then we would have fun discussing it

no the toy goes becaues the spring is wound up i would say

how did the spring get would up he would ask

i wound it up

and how did you get moving

from eating

and food grows only because the sun is shining so its because the sun is shining that all these things are moving that would get the concept across that motion is simply the transformation of the suns power

i turned the page the answer was for the windup toy energy makes it go and for the boy on the bicycle energy makes it go for everything energy makes it go

now that doesnt mean anything suppose its wakalixes thats the general principle wakalixes makes it go there is no knowledge coming in the child doesnt learn anything its just a word

i wouldn’t give  cents for all the fancy principles doctrines philosophies sciences and institutions in the world if behind them they didn’t have plain ordinary everyday conscience guiding them in the right direction

the genetic code is universal i regard this as nearconclusive proof that all organisms are descended from a single common ancestor

in the beginning nearly  billion years ago all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than onetrillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence

if you live long enough you realise that every proven fact is later disproved and then proven again

funny isnt it the power of story

its why i picked up a pen

i slay monsters too

at which point the scientists said those people are terrible people theyre irrational and irresponsible we scientists are okay but those other people are a real problem

yet the truth was that responsibility began with each individual person and the choices he made each person had a choice

natural selection has a new aspect one that is psychological denial such denial where the individual benefits as an individual from his ability to deny the truth even though society as a whole which he is apart suffers

the past exists only as ideas in the mind which themselves are solely neuroelectrical events occurring strictly in the present moment

the future is similarly nothing more than a mental construct an anticipation a grouping of thoughts because thinking itself occurs strictly in the now  where is time

i dont believe in the glory and the dream i believe in statistics

the prohibition era had been a great source of material for building an excellent science of alcohol intoxication

perhaps also there are some necessary truths about mind language and perception after all a compendium of superscientific truths awaiting discovery and dissemination by philosophers

but the world itself is only a speck of dust and man is tinyhelpless how long has he been in existence for millions of years the earth was uninhabited

nonsense the earth is as old as we are no older how could it be older nothing exists except through human consciousness

but the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animalsmammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever heard of

have you ever seen those bones winston of course not nineteenthcentury biologists invented them before man there was nothing after man if he could come to an end there would be nothing outside man there is nothing

i am all for science but science can never tell us why we find the stars so beautiful

it is not against our nature to be curious it is in our nature to be so

for every event at the quantum level the current universe splits into multiple universes this means that for every choice you make an infinite number of universes exist in which you made a different choice

they went to many worlds took so many

in the name of empire fear conquest science

every reason was used to justify their actions

the powerful always justify their actions against the weak

i am a scientist but it’s not the popularization of science that i have in mind rather my main concern is the wellbeing of the human society

and they came to be included in a culture and community that placed the computer science engineer at the highest level of social status

true understanding is an indivisible land of liberation beyond all judgement and all conclusions

when the mind is infested with more judgement conclusions and biases than the actual urge for understanding even the sun appears to be a candle and the ocean a pool

despite all its successes machine learning is still in the alchemy stage of science

but the world itself is only a speck of dust and man is tinyhelpless how long has he been in existence for millions of years the earth was uninhabited

nonsense the earth is as old as we are no older how could it be order nothing exists except through human consciousness

have you ever seen those bones winston of course not nineteenthcentury biologists invented them before man there was nothing after man if he could come to an end there would be nothing outside man there is nothing

there are ecological biological sociological and psychological problems that can never be solved to make this idea work the physical problems of propulsion have capture your fancy and perhaps they can be solved but they are the easy ones

the people who created this amazing mission of exploration chased their new horizons hard they never let go of their dream they put everything they had into it and eventually they chased it down and accomplished what they set out to do

make a decision trust yourself and stick with it

the sky turned a deep purple and all at once the stars and moon came out — and the sun shone at the same time he had reached a layer of the upper atmosphere where the air was too thin to contain reflecting dust particles

an itinerant selfish gene said bodies a plenty ive seen you think youre so clever but ill live for ever youre just a survival machine

there is mystery but never magic and mysteries are all the more beautiful for being eventually explained things are explicable and it is our privilege to explain them

the exact ratio of irony to matter in the universe is known as nove’s constant and by definition it’s more than you’d expect

the promises of science have not been kept promises of efficiency and simplicity have bred nothing but pollution and chaos

stars are born

babies just like us

they live their lives

in the battle between science and storytelling there is simply no competition storytelling wins every time

rather than heralding a new era of easy living the agricultural revolution left farmers with lives generally difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers

some courses were sold for profit but many were made available for free much to the delight of teachers around the world who could use them in their classrooms—and to most anybody eager to learn anything

we can think of life as a selfreplicating informationprocessing system whose information software determines both its behavior and the blueprints for its hardware

real science can be hard but like classical literature or playing the violin worth the struggle

some joined in the dance

but stayed close to the waters

like lizards and seals

frogs turtles and otters

were wired to see patterns

oh the things we once believed

before accepting your guess

just based on how you feel

lets admit we just dont know

and discover if its real
