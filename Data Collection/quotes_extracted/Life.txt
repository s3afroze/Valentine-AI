im selfish impatient and a little insecure i make mistakes i am out of control and at times hard to handle but if you cant handle me at my worst then you sure as hell dont deserve me at my best

youve gotta dance like theres nobody watching

love like youll never be hurt

sing like theres nobody listening

and live like its heaven on earth

you only live once but if you do it right once is enough

in three words i can sum up everything ive learned about life it goes on

to live is the rarest thing in the world most people exist that is all

insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results

it is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not

it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live

there are only two ways to live your life one is as though nothing is a miracle the other is as though everything is a miracle

good friends good books and a sleepy conscience this is the ideal life

sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple

today you are you that is truer than true there is no one alive who is youer than you

im not afraid of death i just dont want to be there when it happens

life isnt about finding yourself life is about creating yourself

sometimes people are beautiful

not in looks

not in what they say

just in what they are

life is like riding a bicycle to keep your balance you must keep moving

some infinities are bigger than other infinities

reality continues to ruin my life

who are you to judge the life i live

i know im not perfect

and i dont live to be

but before you start pointing fingers

make sure you hands are clean

things change and friends leave life doesnt stop for anybody

the only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive

dumbledore watched her fly away and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to snape and his eyes were full of tears

after all this time

when someone loves you the way they talk about you is different you feel safe and comfortable

he has achieved success who has lived well laughed often and loved much

who has enjoyed the trust of pure women the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children

who has filled his niche and accomplished his task

who has never lacked appreciation of earths beauty or failed to express it

who has left the world better than he found it

whether an improved poppy a perfect poem or a rescued soul

who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had

whose life was an inspiration

im the one thats got to die when its time for me to die so let me live my life the way i want to

but better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie

we are what we pretend to be so we must be careful about what we pretend to be

the fear of death follows from the fear of life a man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time

just when you think it cant get any worse it can and just when you think it cant get any better it can

the one you love and the one who loves you are never ever the same person

i speak to everyone in the same way whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university

how wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world

the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom

were all human arent we every human life is worth the same and worth saving

if you dont know where youre going any roadll take you there

all god does is watch us and kill us when we get boring we must never ever be boring

every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad

this life’s hard but it’s harder if you’re stupid

sometimes i can hear my bones straining under the weight of all the lives im not living

death ends a life not a relationship

never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has

do not read as children do to amuse yourself or like the ambitious for the purpose of instruction no read in order to live

you cannot find peace by avoiding life

where there is love there is life

may you live every day of your life

get busy living or get busy dying

these woods are lovely dark and deep

but i have promises to keep

and miles to go before i sleep

and miles to go before i sleep

all the world is made of faith and trust and pixie dust

i dont care harry yelled at them snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace ive had enough ive seen enough i want out i want it to end i dont care anymore

you do care said dumbledore he had not flinched or made a single move to stop harry demolishing his office his expression was calm almost detached you care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it

we have to dare to be ourselves however frightening or strange that self may prove to be

anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination

if my life is going to mean anything i have to live it myself

life is a book and there are a thousand pages i have not yet read

a life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable but more useful than a life spent doing nothing

of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been

if youre reading this

congratulations youre alive

if thats not something to smile about

then i dont know what is

life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards

monsters are real and ghosts are real too they live inside us and sometimes they win

the flower that blooms in adversity is the rarest and most beautiful of all

the best index to a persons character is how he treats people who cant do him any good and how he treats people who cant fight back

the most important thing is to enjoy your life—to be happy—its all that matters

people arent either wicked or noble theyre like chefs salads with good things and bad things chopped and mixed together in a vinaigrette of confusion and conflict

do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail

my experience of life is that it is not divided up into genres it’s a horrifying romantic tragic comical sciencefiction cowboy detective novel you know with a bit of pornography if youre lucky

i love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels lifes a bitch youve got to go out and kick ass

i dont know the question but sex is definitely the answer

two possibilities exist either we are alone in the universe or we are not both are equally terrifying

nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal

but he loves you he loves you and he needs money he always needs money hes allpowerful allperfect allknowing and allwise somehow just cant handle money

remember the time you feel lonely is the time you most need to be by yourself lifes cruelest irony

it is said that your life flashes before your eyes just before you die that is true its called life

it may be unfair but what happens in a few days sometimes even a single day can change the course of a whole lifetime

life is pain highness anyone who says differently is selling something

it isnt what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy it is what you think about it

attitude is a choice happiness is a choice optimism is a choice kindness is a choice giving is a choice respect is a choice whatever choice you make makes you choose wisely

if you love somebody let them go for if they return they were always yours if they dont they never were

lifes under no obligation to give us what we expect

sometimes our light goes out but is blown again into instant flame by an encounter with another human being

unbeing dead isnt being alive

how many slams in an old screen door depends how loud you shut it how many slices in a bread depends how thin you cut it how much good inside a day depends how good you live em how much love inside a friend depends how much you give em

these three are your greatest treasures

simple in actions and thoughts you return to the source of being

patient with both friends and enemies

you accord with the way things are

compassionate toward yourself

you reconcile all beings in the world

nobody likes being alone that much i dont go out of my way to make friends thats all it just leads to disappointment

some people have lives some people have music

tell the truth or someone will tell it for you

the truth is unless you let go unless you forgive yourself unless you forgive the situation unless you realize that the situation is over you cannot move forward

dont be pushed around by the fears in your mind be led by the dreams in your heart

people arent born good or bad maybe theyre born with tendencies either way but its the way you live your life that matters

life is for the living

death is for the dead

let life be like music

and death a note unsaid

the things you do for yourself are gone when you are gone but the things you do for others remain as your legacy

if cats looked like frogs wed realize what nasty cruel little bastards they are style thats what people remember

dare to be

when a new day begins dare to smile gratefully

when there is darkness dare to be the first to shine a light

when there is injustice dare to be the first to condemn it

when something seems difficult dare to do it anyway

when life seems to beat you down dare to fight back

when there seems to be no hope dare to find some

when you’re feeling tired dare to keep going

when times are tough dare to be tougher

when love hurts you dare to love again

when someone is hurting dare to help them heal

when another is lost dare to help them find the way

when a friend falls dare to be the first to extend a hand

when you cross paths with another dare to make them smile

when you feel great dare to help someone else feel great too

when the day has ended dare to feel as you’ve done your best

dare to be the best you can –

at all times dare to be

a woman has to live her life or live to repent not having lived it

instead of worrying about what you cannot control shift your energy to what you can create

the most wasted of all days is one without laughter

the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him but because he loves what is behind him

the more i see the less i know for sure

do i not destroy my enemies when i make them my friends

if you want to forget something or someone never hate it or never hate himher everything and everyone that you hate is engraved upon your heart if you want to let go of something if you want to forget you cannot hate

it’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change grow and transform

if i can stop one heart from breaking i shall not live in vain

life is to be enjoyed not endured

why didnt i learn to treat everything like it was the last time my greatest regret was how much i believed in the future

if you want to be happy do not dwell in the past do not worry about the future focus on living fully in the present

i go to seek a great perhaps

live to the point of tears

more smiling less worrying more compassion less judgment more blessed less stressed more love less hate

dont say you dont have enough time you have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to helen keller pasteur michelangelo mother teresa leonardo da vinci thomas jefferson and albert einstein

i am not sure that i exist actually i am all the writers that i have read all the people that i have met all the women that i have loved all the cities i have visited

this is your life and its ending one moment at a time

take responsibility of your own happiness never put it in other people’s hands

dont take life too seriously punch it in the face when it needs a good hit laugh at it

that was the thing you never got used to it the idea of someone being gone just when you think its reconciled accepted someone points it out to you and it just hits you all over again that shocking

trees are sanctuaries whoever knows how to speak to them whoever knows how to listen to them can learn the truth they do not preach learning and precepts they preach undeterred by particulars the ancient law of life

no matter how much suffering you went through you never wanted to let go of those memories

if i should ever die god forbid let this be my epitaph

the only proof he needed

for the existence of god

he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how

be mindful be grateful be positive be true be kind

be the reason someone smiles be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness in people

it was not the feeling of completeness i so needed but the feeling of not being empty

dont you think its better to be extremely happy for a short while even if you lose it than to be just okay for your whole life

people say that life is the thing but i prefer reading

dwell on the beauty of life watch the stars and see yourself running with them

dont be afraid of death be afraid of an unlived life you dont have to live forever you just have to live

accept yourself love yourself and keep moving forward if you want to fly you have to give up what weighs you down

do what is right not what is easy nor what is popular

dont part with your illusions when they are gone you may still exist but you have ceased to live

to say goodbye is to die a little

live the life of your dreams be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others

you couldnt relive your life skipping the awful parts without losing what made it worthwhile you had to accept it as a wholelike the world or the person you loved

even death has a heart

life he realize was much like a song in the beginning there is mystery in the end there is confirmation but its in the middle where all the emotion resides to make the whole thing worthwhile

life shrinks or expands in proportion to ones courage

the past is a place of reference not a place of residence the past is a place of learning not a place of living

biology gives you a brain life turns it into a mind

im sure the universe is full of intelligent life its just been too intelligent to come here

ive got nothing to do today but smile

that it will never come again is what makes life so sweet

letting go means to come to the realization that some people are a part of your history but not a part of your destiny

books say she did this because life says she did this books are where things are explained to you life is where things arent im not surprised some people prefer books

believe in your heart

believe in your heart that youre meant to live a life full of passion purpose magic and miracles

if you ask me what i came to do in this world i an artist will answer you i am here to live out loud

suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be i have been bent and broken but  i hope  into a better shape

be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals

if you aren’t grateful for what you already have what makes you think you would be happy with more

you realize that our mistrust of the future makes it hard to give up the past

was it hard i ask

not as hard as holding on to something that wasnt real

a learning experience is one of those things that says you know that thing you just did dont do that

you will find that it is necessary to let things go simply for the reason that they are heavy so let them go let go of them i tie no weights to my ankles

maybe everyone can live beyond what theyre capable of

the past has no power over the present moment

make improvements not excuses seek respect not attention

life becomes easier and more beautiful when we can see the good in other people

follow your heart listen to your inner voice stop caring about what others think

dont waste your time with explanations people only hear what they want to hear

no one knows for certain how much impact they have on the lives of other people oftentimes we have no clue yet we push it just the same

once you had put the pieces back together even though you may look intact you were never quite the same as youd been before the fall

life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes dont resist them that only creates sorrow let reality be reality let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like

pursue what catches your heart not what catches your eyes

its all in the view thats what i mean about forever too for any one of us our forever could end in an hour or a hundred years from now you never know for sure so youd better make every second count

a random act of kindness no matter how small can make a tremendous impact on someone elses life

a good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving

you yourself as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection

to be or not to be that is the question

whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer

the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune

or to take arms against a sea of troubles

and by opposing end them to die to sleep

no more and by a sleep to say we end

the heartache and the thousand natural shocks

that flesh is heir to tis a consummation

devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep

to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub

for in that sleep of death what dreams may come

when we have shuffled off this mortal coil

must give us pause theres the respect

that makes calamity of so long life

for who would bear the whips and scorns of time

the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely

the pangs of despised love the laws delay

the insolence of office and the spurns

that patient merit of the unworthy takes

when he himself might his quietus make

with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear

to grunt and sweat under a weary life

but that the dread of something after death

the undiscoverd country from whose bourn

no traveller returns puzzles the will

and makes us rather bear those ills we have

than fly to others that we know not of

thus conscience does make cowards of us all

and thus the native hue of resolution

is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought

and enterprises of great pith and moment

with this regard their currents turn awry

and lose the name of actionsoft you now

the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons

be all my sins rememberd

we can never judge the lives of others because each person knows only their own pain and renunciation its one thing to feel that you are on the right path but its another to think that yours is the only path

don’t waste your time in anger regrets worries and grudges life is too short to be unhappy

the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man

life is about accepting the challenges along the way choosing to keep moving forward and savoring the journey

believe in yourself you are braver than you think more talented than you know and capable of more than you imagine

learn to light a candle in the darkest moments of someone’s life be the light that helps others see it is what gives life its deepest significance

a purpose of human life no matter who is controlling it is to love whoever is around to be loved

wisdom comes from experience experience is often a result of lack of wisdom

your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life keep going tough situations build strong people in the end

you endure what is unbearable and you bear it that is all

no amount of regretting can change the past and no amount of worrying can change the future

the saddest people ive ever met in life are the ones who dont care deeply about anything at all passion and satisfaction go hand in hand and without them any happiness is only temporary because theres nothing to make it last

don’t try to make life a mathematics problem with yourself in the center and everything coming out equal when you’re good bad things can still happen and if you’re bad you can still be lucky

no persons are more frequently wrong than those who will not admit they are wrong

when you find your path you must not be afraid you need to have sufficient courage to make mistakes disappointment defeat and despair are the tools god uses to show us the way

if people refuse to look at you in a new light and they can only see you for what you were only see you for the mistakes youve made if they dont realize that you are not your mistakes then they have to go

you can have it all just not all at once

if you end up with a boring miserable life because you listened to your mom your dad your teacher your priest or some guy on television telling you how to do your shit then you deserve it

one of the advantages of being disorganized is that one is always having surprising discoveries

the purpose of life is to live it to taste experience to the utmost to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience

the more you know who you are and what you want the less you let things upset you

whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever they always list depression among the side effects of cancer but in fact depression is not a side effect of cancer depression is a side effect of dying

appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak

i meant said ipslore bitterly what is there in this world that truly makes living worthwhile

death thought about it

cats he said eventually cats are nice

it does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop

remember remember this is now and now and now live it feel it cling to it i want to become acutely aware of all i’ve taken for granted

do not fall in love with people like me

i will take you to museums and parks and monuments and kiss you in every beautiful place so that you can never go back to them without tasting me like blood in your mouth

i will destroy you in the most beautiful way possible and when i leave you will finally understand why storms are named after people

start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart

cry forgive learn move on let your tears water the seeds of your future happiness

all parents damage their children it cannot be helped youth like pristine glass absorbs the prints of its handlers some parents smudge others crack a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces beyond repair

there is only one sin and that is theft when you tell a lie you steal someones right to the truth

i like flaws i think they make things interesting

success is not how high you have climbed but how you make a positive difference to the world

friendship marks a life even more deeply than love love risks degenerating into obsession friendship is never anything but sharing

treat everyone with politeness and kindness not because they are nice but because you are

the trouble is if you don’t spend your life yourself other people spend it for you

be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone

do not fear failure but rather fear not trying

you cannot control the behavior of others but you can always choose how you respond to it

life is not a matter of holding good cards but of playing a poor hand well

time was passing like a hand waving from a train i wanted to be on

i hope you never have to think about anything as much as i think about you

i dont like people who have never fallen or stumbled their virtue is lifeless and it isnt of much value life hasnt revealed its beauty to them

top  things money can’t buy

well get used to that feeling thats how your whole life will feel some day

this is all practice

dont just

dont just learn experience

dont just read absorb

dont just change transform

dont just relate advocate

dont just promise prove

dont just criticize encourage

dont just think ponder

dont just take give

dont just see feel

don’t just dream do

dont just hear listen

dont just talk act

dont just tell show

dont just exist live

please believe that things are good with me and even when theyre not they will be soon enough and i will always believe the same about you

never be bullied into silence never allow yourself to be made a victim accept no ones definition of your life but define yourself

to choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation

if the real world were a book it would never find a publisher overlong detailed to the point of distractionand ultimately without a major resolution

how nice  to feel nothing and still get full credit for being alive

there are two means of refuge from the misery of life — music and cats

always find opportunities to make someone smile and to offer random acts of kindness in everyday life

theres nowhere you can be that isnt where youre meant to be

if i had my life to live over again i would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week

they say im oldfashioned and live in the past but sometimes i think progress progresses too fast

better to die fighting for freedom then be a prisoner all the days of your life

if you know someone who’s depressed please resolve never to ask them why depression isn’t a straightforward response to a bad situation depression just is like the weather

i could die for you but i couldnt and wouldnt live for you

im killing time while i wait for life to shower me with meaning and happiness

you never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone change begins at the end of your comfort zone

anxiety is the dizziness of freedom

never lose hope storms make people stronger and never last forever

be thankful for what you have youll end up having more if you concentrate on what you dont have you will never ever have enough

do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future there are no limits to what you can achieve on your journey through life except in your mind

to shine your brightest light is to be who you truly are

i want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me

if then i were asked for the most important advice i could give that which i considered to be the most useful to the men of our century i should simply say in the name of god stop a moment cease your work look around you

to love life to love it even

when you have no stomach for it

and everything youve held dear

crumbles like burnt paper in your hands

your throat filled with the silt of it

when grief sits with you its tropical heat

thickening the air heavy as water

more fit for gills than lungs

when grief weights you like your own flesh

only more of it an obesity of grief

you think how can a body withstand this

then you hold life like a face

between your palms a plain face

no charming smile no violet eyes

and you say yes i will take you

i will love you again

be thankful for everything that happens in your life it’s all an experience

after

all this time

the sun never says to the earth

you owe me

what happens

with a love like that

it lights the whole sky

incredible change happens in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power over instead of craving control over what you dont

a man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life

life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all

time doesn’t heal emotional pain you need to learn how to let go

luxury is not a necessity to me but beautiful and good things are

you are not rich until you have a rich heart

when things break its not the actual breaking that prevents them from getting back together again its because a little piece gets lost  the two remaining ends couldnt fit together even if they wanted to the whole shape has changed

stop comparing yourself to other people just choose to be happy and live your own life

you get what anybody gets  you get a lifetime

death is so terribly final while life is full of possibilities

life doesnt imitate art it imitates bad television

maybe this world is another planet’s hell

the most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create to overcome to endure to transform to love and to be greater than our suffering

i sit beside the fire and think

of all that i have seen

of meadow flowers and butterflies

in summers that have been

of yellow leaves and gossamer

in autumns that there were

with morning mist and silver sun

and wind upon my hair

i sit beside the fire and think

of how the world will be

when winter comes without a spring

that i shall ever see

for still there are so many things

that i have never seen

there is a different green

i sit beside the fire and think

and people that will see a world

that i shall never know

but all the while i sit and think

of times there were before

and voices at the door

i have accepted fear as part of life – specifically the fear of change i have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says turn back

nothing in life is to be feared it is only to be understood now is the time to understand more so that we may fear less

it is not the length of life but the depth

he allowed himself to be swayed by his conviction that human beings are not born once and for all on the day their mothers give birth to them but that life obliges them over and over again to give birth to themselves

there is a saying in tibetan tragedy should be utilized as a source of strength

no matter what sort of difficulties how painful experience is if we lose our hope thats our real disaster

throw your dreams into space like a kite and you do not know what it will bring back a new life a new friend a new love a new country

sometimes it takes a good fall to really know where you stand

be steady and wellordered in your life so that you can be fierce and original in your work

do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul

laugh even when you feel too sick or too worn out or tired

smile even when youre trying not to cry and the tears are blurring your vision

sing even when people stare at you and tell you your voice is crappy

trust even when your heart begs you not to

twirl even when your mind makes no sense of what you see

frolick even when you are made fun of kiss even when others are watching sleep even when youre afraid of what the dreams might bring

run even when it feels like you cant run any more

your emotions are the slaves to your thoughts and you are the slave to your emotions

life has no remoteget up and change it yourself

the bhagavad gitathat ancient indian yogic textsays that it is better to live your own destiny imperfectly than to live an imitation of somebody elses life with perfection

sometimes you dont need a goal in life you dont need to know the big picture you just need to know what youre going to do next

sometimes i lie awake at night and i ask where have i gone wrong

then a voice says to me this is going to take more than one night

if a man will begin with certainties he shall end in doubts but if he will be content to begin with doubts he shall end in certainties

i believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong i believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls i believe that tomorrow is another day and i believe in miracles

i’ve known people that the world has thrown everything at to discourage themto break their spirit and yet something about them retains a dignity they face life and don’t ask quarters

ill try anything once twice if i like it three times to make sure

tiger got to hunt bird got to fly

man got to sit and wonder why why why

tiger got to sleep bird got to land

man got to tell himself he understand

what a strange thing

to be alive

life is to be lived not controlled and humanity is won by continuing to play in face of certain defeat

when you consider things like the stars our affairs dont seem to matter very much do they

it was only a sunny smile and little it cost in the giving but like morning light it scattered the night and made the day worth living

there are times to stay put and what you want will come to you and there are times to go out into the world and find such a thing for yourself

the secret of life is honesty and fair dealing if you can fake that youve got it made

my only advice is to stay aware listen carefully and yell for help if you need it

when i look in the mirror i know i’m looking at someone who isn’t sure she deserves to be loved at all

life has become immeasurably better since i have been forced to stop taking it seriously

sometimes the right thing feels all wrong until it is over and done with

what makes big boobs and perkiness so attractive to boys i mean really two round mounds of fat and a fake smile yeah winning attributes

i just need to know that someone out there listens and understands and doesnt try to sleep with someone even if they could have i need to know these people exist

life seems sometimes like nothing more than a series of losses from beginning to end thats the given how you respond to those losses what you make of whats left thats the part you have to make up as you go

after all tomorrow is another day

we are taught you must blame your father your sisters your brothers the school the teachers  but never blame yourself its never your fault but its always your fault because if you wanted to change youre the one who has got to change

the real things havent changed it is still best to be honest and truthful to make the most of what we have to be happy with simple pleasures and have courage when things go wrong

i felt once more how simple and frugal a thing is happiness a glass of wine a roast chestnut a wretched little brazier the sound of the sea nothing else

i live in my own little world but its ok they know me here

living is easy with eyes closed

i am incapable of conceiving infinity and yet i do not accept finity i want this adventure that is the context of my life to go on without end

life isnt fair its just fairer than death thats all

face your life its pain its pleasure leave no path untaken

the difference between fiction and reality fiction has to make sense

sometimes you have to lose all you have to find out who you truly are

let the improvement of yourself keep you so busy that you have no time to criticize others

do not set aside your happiness do not wait to be happy in the future the best time to be happy is always now

if you cant change your fate change your attitude

to acquire the habit of reading is to construct for yourself a refuge from almost all the miseries of life

the right thing and the easy thing are never the same

sometimes life knocks you on your ass get up get up get up happiness is not the absence of problems its the ability to deal with them

no sympathy for the devil keep that in mind buy the ticket take the rideand if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind wellmaybe chalk it up to forced consciousness expansion tune in freak out get beaten

dont be afraid to be confused try to remain permanently confused anything is possible stay open forever so open it hurts and then open up some more until the day you die world without end amen

no matter how long you train someone to be brave you never know if they are or not until something real happens

if you care about something you have to protect it – if you’re lucky enough to find a way of life you love you have to find the courage to live it

now and then its good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy

you live but once you might as well be amusing

death is not the opposite of life but a part of it

at the time my life just seemed too complete and maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves

we cannot change the cards we are dealt just how we play the hand

thats what people do who love you they put their arms around you and love you when youre not so lovable

id learned that some things are best kept secret

people make mistakes in life through believing too much but they have a damned dull time if they believe too little

so it’s true when all is said and done grief is the price we pay for love

there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it

i can choose either to be a victim of the world or an adventurer in search of treasure its all a question of how i view my life

unexpected intrusions of beauty this is what life is

whoever saves one life saves the world entire

why are trying so hard to fit in when youre born to stand out

sometimes you have to kind of die inside in order to rise from your own ashes and believe in yourself and love yourself to become a new person

help others without any reason and give without the expectation of receiving anything in return

despite your best efforts people are going to be hurt when its time for them to be hurt

there’s no such thing as ruining your life life’s a pretty resilient thing it turns out

how would your life be different if…you stopped making negative judgmental assumptions about people you encounter let today be the day…you look for the good in everyone you meet and respect their journey

do i dare

disturb the universe

in a minute there is time

for decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse

if you can keep your head when all about you

are losing theirs and blaming it on you

if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you

but make allowance for their doubting too

if you can wait and not be tired by waiting

or being lied about dont deal in lies

or being hated dont give way to hating

and yet dont look too good nor talk too wise

if you can dream  and not make dreams your master

if you can think  and not make thoughts your aim

if you can meet with triumph and disaster

and treat those two impostors just the same

if you can bear to hear the truth youve spoken

twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools

or watch the things you gave your life to broken

and stoop and build em up with wornout tools

if you can make one heap of all your winnings

and risk it on one turn of pitchandtoss

and lose and start again at your beginnings

and never breathe a word about your loss

if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

to serve your turn long after they are gone

and so hold on when there is nothing in you

except the will which says to them hold on

if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue

or walk with kings  nor lose the common touch

if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you

if all men count with you but none too much

if you can fill the unforgiving minute

with sixty seconds worth of distance run

yours is the earth and everything thats in it

and  which is more  youll be a man my son

let me be was all i wanted be what i am no matter how i am

life is pleasant death is peaceful its the transition thats troublesome

i think ive discovered the secret of life  you just hang around until you get used to it

growing up is losing some illusions in order to acquire others

there is not a particle of life which does not bear poetry within it

the thing about getting older is that you dont need everything to be possible any more you just need things to be certain

a pain stabbed my heart as it did every time i saw a girl i loved who was going the opposite direction in this toobig world

what good is the warmth of summer without the cold of winter to give it sweetness

dont be afraid of enemies who attack you be afraid of the friends who flatter you

every one of us is losing something precious to us lost opportunities lost possibilities feelings we can never get back again that’s part of what it means to be alive

almost nobody dances sober unless they happen to be insane

in the name of god stop a moment cease your work look around you

the trouble with being in the rat race is that even if you win youre still a rat

life is worth living as long as theres a laugh in it

there is some kind of a sweet innocence in being human in not having to be just happy or just sad in the nature of being able to be both broken and whole at the same time

life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced

she burned too bright for this world

we are all the pieces of what we remember we hold in ourselves the hopes and fears of those who love us as long as there is love and memory there is no true loss

great things happen to those who dont stop believing trying learning and being grateful

believe in your infinite potential your only limitations are those you set upon yourself

it’s your life you don’t need someone’s permission to live the life you want be brave to live from your heart

how people treat you is their karma how you react is yours

but how could you live and have no story to tell

the only person who can pull me down is myself and im not going to let myself pull me down anymore

every mans life ends the same way it is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another

in everybody’s life there’s a point of no return and in a very few cases a point where you can’t go forward anymore and when we reach that point all we can do is quietly accept the fact that’s how we survive

the biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams

if you want to make god laugh tell him about your plans

man is condemned to be free because once thrown into the world he is responsible for everything he does

it is up to you to give life a meaning

one lives in the hope of becoming a memory

thats what literature is its the people who went before us tapping out messages from the past from beyond the grave trying to tell us about life and death listen to them

the two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why

there is nothing more rare nor more beautiful than a woman being unapologetically herself comfortable in her perfect imperfection to me that is the true essence of beauty

accept what life offers you and try to drink from every cup all wines should be tasted some should only be sipped but with others drink the whole bottle

i believe that words are strong that they can overwhelm what we fear when fear seems more awful than life is good

ester asked why people are sad

no man ever steps in the same river twice for its not the same river and hes not the same man

the best things in life make you sweaty

i live my life in widening circles that reach out across the world

a man with outward courage dares to die a man with inner courage dares to live

hiding how you really feel and trying to make everyone happy doesnt make you nice it just makes you a liar

i don’t live in either my past or my future i’m interested only in the present if you can concentrate always on the present you’ll be a happy man life will be a party for you a grand festival because life is the moment we’re living now

the more you feed your mind with positive thoughts the more you can attract great things into your life

be brave and take risks you need to have faith in yourself be brave and take risks you dont have to have it all figured out to move forward

happiness depends on your mindset and attitude

do not lie to yourself

we have to be honest about what we want and take risks rather than lie to ourselves and make excuses to stay in our comfort zone

surround yourself with people who believe in your dreams

surround yourself with people who believe in your dreams encourage your ideas support your ambitions and bring out the best in you

if you believe very strongly in something stand up and fight for it

always remember people who have helped you along the way and don’t forget to lift someone up

sometimes the hardest part isnt letting go but rather learning to start over

never complain never explain resist the temptation to defend yourself or make excuses

there are two tragedies in life one is to lose your hearts desire the other is to gain it

do not despise your own place and hour every place is under the stars every place is the center of the world

i think prime numbers are like life they are very logical but you could never work out the rules even if you spent all your time thinking about them

when you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive to think to enjoy to love

nothing ever happens like you imagine it will

many people die at twenty five and arent buried until they are seventy five

believe something and the universe is on its way to being changed because youve changed by believing once youve changed other things start to follow isnt that the way it works

if theres a thing ive learned in my life its to not be afraid of the responsibility that comes with caring for other people what we do for love those things endure even if the people you do them for dont

the meaning of life is that it stops

as soon as you trust yourself you will know how to live

simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance

one choice decided your friends

one choice defines your beliefs

one choice determines your loyalties  forever

once choice can transform you

pull up a chair take a taste come join us life is so endlessly delicious

the world is a tragedy to those who feel but a comedy to those who think

when the going gets tough put one foot in front of the other and just keep going don’t give up

people are like stainedglass windows they sparkle and shine when the sun is out but when the darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within

when you do the right thing you get the feeling of peace and serenity associated with it do it again and again

do what you love love what you do and with all your heart give yourself to it

once you realize you deserve a bright future letting go of your dark past is the best choice you will ever make

the outer world is a reflection of the inner world other people’s perception of you is a reflection of them your response to them is an awareness of you

its never too late to change your life for the better you dont have to take huge steps to change your life making even the smallest changes to your daily routine can make a big difference to your life

strong people have a strong sense of selfworth and selfawareness they don’t need the approval of others

maturity is when you stop complaining and making excuses and start making changes

you spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth thinking about how youll escape one day and how awesome it will be and imagining that future keeps you going but you never do it you just use the future to escape the present

at the end of the day let there be no excuses no explanations no regrets

lifes as kind as you let it be

stop giving other people the power to control your happiness your mind and your life if you dont take control of yourself and your own life someone else is bound to try

i believe there is another world waiting for us a better world and ill be waiting for you there

we could do it you know

what

leave the district run off live in the woods you and i we could make it

i am fated to journey hand in hand with my strange heroes and to survey the surging immensity of life to survey it through the laughter that all can see and through the tears unseen and unknown by anyone

youre on earth theres no cure for that

the aim of life is to live and to live means to be aware joyously drunkenly serenely divinely aware

youve a good heart sometimes thats enough to see you safe wherever you go but mostly its not

its not the men in your life that matters its the life in your men

it all goes away eventually everything goes away

some of us get dipped in flat some in satin some in gloss he turned to me but every once in a while you find someone whos iridescent and when you do nothing will ever compare

over rock and under tree

by caves where never sun has shone

by streams that never find the sea

over snow by winter sown

and through the merry flowers of june

over grass and over stone

and under mountains in the moon

under cloud and under star

yet feet that wandering have gone

turn at last to home afar

eyes that fire and sword have seen

and horror in the halls of stone

look at last on meadows green

and trees and hills they long have known

the road goes ever on and on

down from the door where it began

now far ahead the road has gone

and i must follow if i can

pursuing it with eager feet

until it joins some larger way

where many paths and errands meet

the road goes ever on and on

down from the door where it began

now far ahead the road has gone

and i must follow if i can

pursuing it with weary feet

until it joins some larger way

where many paths and errands meet

and whither then i cannot say

the road goes ever on and on

out from the door where it began

now far ahead the road has gone

let others follow if they can

let them a journey new begin

but i at last with weary feet

will turn towards the lighted inn

my eveningrest and sleep to meet

to fear love is to fear life and those who fear life are already parts dead

the problem with people is they forget that most of the time its the small things that count

focus on your character not your reputation

focus on your blessings not your misfortunes

when in a relationship a real man doesnt make his woman jealous of others he makes others jealous of his woman

develop an interest in life as you see it the people things literature music  the world is so rich simply throbbing with rich treasures beautiful souls and interesting people forget yourself

to be creative means to be in love with life you can be creative only if you love life enough that you want to enhance its beauty you want to bring a little more music to it a little more poetry to it a little more dance to it

i wonder why i dont go to bed and go to sleep but then it would be tomorrow so i decide that no matter how tired no matter how incoherent i am i can skip on hour more of sleep and live

life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it a jealous possessive love that grabs at what it can but life leaps over oblivion lightly losing only a thing or two of no importance and gloom is but the passing shadow of a cloud

i can see how it might be possible for a man to look down upon the earth and be an atheist but i cannot conceive how a man could look up into the heavens and say there is no god

what would come would comeand you would have to meet it when it did

one of the few good things about modern times if you die horribly on television you will not have died in vain you will have entertained us

those who are willing to be vulnerable move among mysteries

when a woman becomes her own best friend life is easier

dont ask for guarantees and dont look to be saved in any one thing person machine or library do your own bit of saving and if you drown at least die knowing you were heading for shore

i learned this at least by my experiment that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours

i envy people that know love that have someone who takes them as they are

life is too short or too long for me to allow myself the luxury of living it so badly

paradoxically though it may seem it is none the less true that life imitates art far more than art imitates life

im sorry for my inability to let unimportant things go for my inability to hold on to the important things

one always has a better book in ones mind than one can manage to get onto paper

find the things that matter and hold on to them and fight for them and refuse to

let them go

how can i be reasonable to me our love was everything and you were my whole life it is not very pleasant to realize that to you it was only an episode

throughout life people will make you mad disrespect you and treat you bad let god deal with the things they do cause hate in your heart will consume you too

you must learn to let go release the stress you were never in control anyway

i will not try to convince you to love me to respect me to commit to me i deserve better than that i am better than thatgoodbye

when great trees fall

when great trees fall

lions hunker down

and even elephants

lumber after safety

when great trees fall

small things recoil into silence

their senses

the air around us becomes

we breathe briefly

our eyes briefly

see with

our memory suddenly sharpened

our reality bound to

them takes leave of us

our souls

dependent upon their

now shrink wizened

our minds formed

and informed by their

we are not so much maddened

as reduced to the unutterable ignorance

and when great souls die

after a period peace blooms

slowly and always

with a kind of

our senses restored never

to be the same whisper to us

we can be be and be

better for they existed

my life didnt please me so i created my life

four be the things i am wiser to know

idleness sorrow a friend and a foe

four be the things id been better without

love curiosity freckles and doubt

three be the things i shall never attain

envy content and sufficient champagne

three be the things i shall have till i die

laughter and hope and a sock in the eye

tears idle tears i know not what they mean

tears from the depths of some devine despair

rise in the heart and gather to the eyes

in looking on the happy autumn fields

and thinking of the days that are no more

i just wanted to tell you that i understand if you go it’s okay if you have to leave us it’s okay if you want to stop fighting

i dont want to achieve immortality through my work i want to achieve immortality through not dying i dont want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen i want to live on in my apartment

you dont have to disrespect and insult others simply to hold your own ground if you do that shows how shaky your own position is

there is nothing more frightful than ignorance in action

everyone is down on pain because they forget something important about it pain is for the living only the dead dont feel it

our lives are defined by opportunities even the ones we miss

very occasionally if you pay really close attention life doesnt suck

it was always the becoming he dreamed of never the being

yea all things live forever though at times they sleep and are forgotten

you do not immortalize the lost by writing about them language buries but does not resurrect

the story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye the story of love is hello and goodbyeuntil we meet again

who are you

are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies

have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them

i have i am fucking crazy

but i am free

dont think about making life better for other people who dont even deserve you rather focus on making your life the best for yourself and those who love you

i have no idea whats awaiting me or what will happen when this all ends for the moment i know this there are sick people and they need curing

if youve never eaten while crying you don t know what life tastes like

you never knew the last time you were seeing someone you didnt know when the last argument happened or the last time you had sex or the last time you looked into their eyes and thanked god they were in your life

after they were gone

that was all you thought about

day and night

cynics are simply thwarted romantics

prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away i think prime numbers are like life they are very logical but you could never work out the rules even if you spent all your time thinking about them

remember that everyone you meet is afraid of something loves something and has lost something

even for me life had its gleams of sunshine

the person you became with her is worth being

if there were such a thing as terminal literalism youd have died in childhood

always have a willing hand to help someone you might be the only one that does

great leaders create more leaders not followers

don’t sacrifice yourself too much because if you sacrifice too much there’s nothing else you can give and nobody will care for you

renew release let go yesterday’s gone there’s nothing you can do to bring it back you can’t should’ve done something you can only do something renew yourself release that attachment today is a new day

just living is not enough said the butterfly one must have sunshine freedom and a little flower

how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a weary world

a fit healthy body—that is the best fashion statement

the best of us must sometimes eat our words

closed in a room my imagination becomes the universe and the rest of the world is missing out

i would rather be ashes than dust

i would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dryrot

i would rather be a superb meteor every atom of me in magnificent glow than a sleepy and permanent planet

the function of man is to live not to exist

i shall not waste my days trying to prolong them

i shall use my time

forget yesterday  it has already forgotten you dont sweat tomorrow  you havent even met instead open your eyes and your heart to a truly precious gift  today

there are no random actswe are all connectedyou can no more separate one life from another than you can separate a breeze from the wind

life is like a novel its filled with suspense you have no idea what is going to happen until you turn the page

don’t let others tell you what you can’t do dont let the limitations of others limit your vision if you can remove your selfdoubt and believe in yourself you can achieve what you never thought possible

there comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page write another book or simply close it

its not what you say out of your mouth that determines your life its what you whisper to yourself that has the most power

oh dont cry im so sorry i cheated so much but thats the way things are

life is funny things change people change but you will always be you so stay true to yourself and never sacrifice who you are for anyone

we are all connected to each other biologically to the earth chemically to the rest of the universe atomically

and how are you feeling asked patrick

oh i’m grand augustus waters smiled with a corner of his mouth i’m on a roller coaster that only goes up my friend

i dont think that there are any limits to how excellent we could make life seem

the object of life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane

do not ask your children

to strive for extraordinary lives

such striving may seem admirable

but it is the way of foolishness

help them instead to find the wonder

and the marvel of an ordinary life

show them the joy of tasting

tomatoes apples and pears

show them how to cry

when pets and people die

show them the infinite pleasure

in the touch of a hand

and make the ordinary come alive for them

the extraordinary will take care of itself

life with its rules its obligations and its freedoms is like a sonnet youre given the form but you have to write the sonnet yourself  mrs whatsit

life doesn’t get easier or more forgiving we get stronger and more resilient

all human beings have three lives public private and secret

just keep moving forward and dont give a shit about what anybody thinks do what you have to do for you

but i dont believe that life is supposed to make you feel good or to make you feel miserable either life is just supposed to make you feel

the future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour whatever he does whoever he is

life will not break your heart itll crush it

for i have known them all already known them all—

have known the evenings mornings afternoons

i have measured out my life with coffee spoons

it does not matter how long you are spending on the earth how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received it is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters

there is a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven

a time to be born and a time to die

a time to plant and a time to uproot

a time to kill and a time to heal

a time to tear down and a time to build

a time to weep and a time to laugh

a time to mourn and a time to dance

a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them

a time to embrace and a time to refrain

a time to search and a time to give up

a time to keep and a time to throw away

a time to tear and a time to mend

a time to be silent and a time to speak

a time to love and a time to hate

a time for war and a time for peace

there are it has been said two types of people in the world there are those who when presented with a glass that is exactly half full say this glass is half full and then there are those who say this glass is half empty

the world belongs however to those who can look at the glass and say whats up with this glass excuse me excuse me this is my glass i dont think so my glass was full and it was a bigger glass whos been pinching my beer

follow your bliss and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls

art is the proper task of life

nobody wants to be here and nobody wants to leave

i want words at my funeral but i guess that means you need life in your life

when things go wrong dont go with them

to travel is to live

too many people spend money they havent earned to buy things they dont want to impress people that they dont like

then i discovered that being related is no guarantee of love

we are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works

you are not the victim of the world but rather the master of your own destiny it is your choices and decisions that determine your destiny

the cosmos is within us we are made of starstuff we are a way for the universe to know itself

a kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal

most of the basic material a writer works with is acquired before the age of fifteen

breathe let go and remind yourself that this very moment is the only one you know you have for sure

life isnt as serious as the mind makes it out to be

if your daily life seems poor do not blame it blame yourself tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches for to the creator there is no poverty and no poor indifferent place

a smart person knows how to talk a wise person knows when to be silent

in all of living have much fun and laughter life is to be enjoyed not just endured

don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice

at some point we all look up and realize we are lost in a maze

if there was anything that depressed him more than his own cynicism it was that quite often it still wasnt as cynical as real life

when a man cannot choose he ceases to be a man

amor fati – love your fate which is in fact your life

i want to live my life in such a way that when i get out of bed in the morning the devil says aw shit hes up

poetry is just the evidence of life if your life is burning well poetry is just the ash

this isnt life in the fast lane its life in the oncoming traffic

human beings are not born once and for all on the day their mothers give birth to them but  life obliges them over and over again to give birth to themselves

perhaps i know best why it is man alone who laughs he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter

when life gives you lemons chunk it right back

there was beauty in the idea of freedom but it was an illusion every human heart was chained by love

but i have learned that you make your own happiness that part of going for what you want means losing something else and when the stakes are high the losses can be that much greater

no one here gets out alive

as is a tale so is life not how long it is but how good it is is what matters

i wish you all very good lives

if you don’t give up on something you truly believe in you will find a way

we demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty

life is not a pg feelgood movie real life often ends badly literature tries to document this reality while showing us it is still possible for us to endure nobly

we choose our joys and sorrows long before we experience them

some things you hear with your ears others you hear with your heart

how terribly sad it was that people are made in such a way that they get used to something as extraordinary as living

the more you praise and celebrate your life the more there is in life to celebrate

you can live your whole life not realizing that what youre looking for is right in front of you

most everything you think you know about me is nothing more than memories

focus on your goals not your fear

focus like a laser beam on your goals

though the roads been rocky it sure feels good to me

im the girl nobody knows until she commits suicide then suddenly everyone had a class with her

each affects the other and the other affects the next and the world is full of stories but the stories are all one

i am not the same having seen the moon shine on the other side of the world

be the positive impact on the lives of others

you cant just plan a moment when things get back on track just as you cant plan the moment you lose your way in the first place

youre both the fire and the water that extinguishes it youre the narrator the protagonist and the sidekick youre the storyteller and the story told you are somebodys something but you are also your you

there is more to life than simply increasing its speed

the best way to predict your future is to create it

the human race tends to remember the abuses to which it has been subjected rather than the endearments whats left of kisses wounds however leave scars

you were born with potential

you were born with goodness and trust you were born with ideals and dreams you were born with greatness

you were born with wings

you are not meant for crawling so dont

you have wings

learn to use them and fly

be happy but never satisfied

dont confuse poor decisionmaking with destiny own your mistakes it’s ok we all make them learn from them so they can empower you

to look life in the face always to look life in the face and to know it for what it isat last to love it for what it is and then to put it away

do not lose hope — what you seek will be found trust ghosts trust those that you have helped to help you in their turn trust dreams trust your heart and trust your story from instructions

i dont get it caroline said bemused shes the only one with wings why is that

there were so many questions in life you couldnt ever have all the answers but i knew this one

its so she can fly i said then i started to run

in the end it wasnt death that surprised her but the stubbornness of life

unless you love them and then they can burn it down

yeah sometimes life really sucks she says but you know what im holding on for

i raise my eyebrows

she raises hers too mimicking me

the moments that dont suck she says the trick is to notice them when they come around

you cant become a decent horseman until you fall off and get up again a good number of times

theres life in a nutshell

integrity is doing the right thing when nobodys watching and doing as you say you would do

discipline your mind to think positively discipline your mind to see the good in every situation and look on the best side of every event

you don’t have to like someone but you have to treat them as you wish to be treated

style is the answer to everything

a fresh way to approach a dull or dangerous thing

to do a dull thing with style is preferable to doing a dangerous thing without it

to do a dangerous thing with style is what i call art

bullfighting can be an art

boxing can be an art

loving can be an art

opening a can of sardines can be an art

not many have style

not many can keep style

i have seen dogs with more style than men

although not many dogs have style

cats have it with abundance

when hemingway put his brains to the wall with a shotgun

that was style

or sometimes people give you style

john the baptist

i have met men in jail with style

i have met more men in jail with style than men out of jail

style is the difference a way of doing a way of being done

or you naked walking out of the bathroom without seeing me

life is a journey time is a river the door is ajar

if you need something from somebody always give that person a way to hand it to you

he died that day because his body had served its purpose his soul had done what it came to do learned what it came to learn and then was free to leave

theres gon be some stuff you gon see

thats gon make it hard to smile in the future

but through whatever you see

through all the rain and the pain

you gotta keep your sense of humor

you gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit

remember that

hardships make or break people

the laughing heart

your life is your life

don’t let it be clubbed into dank submission

be on the watch

there are ways out

there is a light somewhere

it may not be much light but

it beats the darkness

be on the watch

the gods will offer you chances

know them

take them

you can’t beat death but

you can beat death in life sometimes

and the more often you learn to do it

the more light there will be

your life is your life

know it while you have it

you are marvelous

the gods wait to delight

in you

turn your obstacles into opportunities and your problems into possibilities

taking pictures is savoring life intensely every hundredth of a second

and therein lies the whole of mans plight human time does not turn in a circle it runs ahead in a straight line that is why man cannot be happy happiness is the longing for repetition

cinema is the ultimate pervert art it doesnt give you what you desire  it tells you how to desire

we’d met at a carefree time a moment full of promise in its place now were the harsh lessons of the real world

its worth making time to find the things that really stir your soul that’s what makes you really feel alive you have to say ‘no’ to other things you’re used to and do it with all your heart

dreams dont work unless you take action the surest way to make your dreams come true is to live them

i seem to have run in a great circle and met myself again on the starting line

to sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world thats what everybody does every hour of his life if i asked you to keep your soul  would you understand why thats much harder

but if everything was always smooth and perfect youd get too used to that you know you have to have a little bit of disorganization now and then otherwise youll never really enjoy it when things go right

keep love in your heart a life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead the consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring

there was a moment in my life when i really wanted to kill myself and there was one other moment when i was close to that    but even in my most jaded times i had some hope

i dont know why we are here but im pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves

art is to console those who are broken by life

quiet is peace tranquility quiet is turning down the volume knob on life silence is pushing the off button shutting it down all of it  amir

after all whats a life anyway were born we live a little while we die

if you dont know who you truly are youll never know what you really want

the more i live the more i learn the more i learn the more i realize the less i know

you’re not obligated to win you’re obligated to keep trying to the best you can do everyday

when you hold a grudge you want someone else’s sorrow to reflect your level of hurt but the two rarely meet

the cost of a thing is the amount of what i will call life which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run

never let hard lessons harden your heart the hard lessons of life are meant to make you better not bitter

you are  your life and nothing else

life gives us choices you either grab on with both hands and just go for it or you sit on the sidelines

learning to distance yourself from all the negativity is one of the greatest lessons to achieve inner peace

what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying

being happy doesnt mean that everything is perfect it means that youve decided to look beyond the imperfections

never respond to an angry person with a fiery comeback even if he deserves itdont allow his anger to become your anger

it is a very funny thing that the sleepier you are the longer you take about getting to bed

strange i thought how you can be living your dreams and your nightmares at the very same time

vday…if you need this one day in a year to show everyone else you truly care for your loved one i think it’s quite stupid i hate this commercialism it’s all artificial and has nothing to do with real love

how we spend our days is of course how we spend our lives

carve your name on hearts not tombstones a legacy is etched into the minds of others and the stories they share about you

there will be time there will be time

to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet

as far as we can discern the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light of meaning in the darkness of mere being

when you compare the sorrows of real life to the pleasures of the imaginary one you will never want to live again only to dream forever

the worst memories stick with us while the nice ones always seem to slip through our fingers

life is a gift dont forget to live it

our revels now are ended these our actors

as i foretold you were all spirits and

are melted into air into thin air

and like the baseless fabric of this vision

the cloudcapp’d towers the gorgeous palaces

the solemn temples the great globe itself

yea all which it inherit shall dissolve

and like this insubstantial pageant faded

leave not a rack behind we are such stuff

as dreams are made on and our little life

is rounded with a sleep

a single death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic

gratitude builds a bridge to abundance

independence is my happiness and i view things as they are without regard to place or person my country is the world and my religion is to do good

all opinions are not equal some are a very great deal more robust sophisticated and well supported in logic and argument than others

there are many things worth living for a few things worth dying for and nothing worth killing for

don’t bother trying to explain your emotions live everything as intensely as you can and keep whatever you felt as a gift from god the best way to destroy the bridge between the visible and invisible is by trying to explain your emotions

sandra’s seen a leprechaun

laurie danced with witches once

charlie found some goblins gold

susy spied an elf

but all the magic i have known

ive had to make myself

if you want to identify me ask me not where i live or what i like to eat or how i comb my hair but ask me what i am living for in detail ask me what i think is keeping me from living fully for the thing i want to live for

why not you

today many will awaken with a fresh sense of inspiration why not you

today many will open their eyes to the beauty that surrounds them why not you

today many will choose to leave the ghost of yesterday behind and seize the immeasurable power of today why not you

today many will break through the barriers of the past by looking at the blessings of the present why not you

today for many the burden of self doubt and insecurity will be lifted by the security and confidence of empowerment why not you

today many will rise above their believed limitations and make contact with their powerful innate strength why not you

today many will choose to live in such a manner that they will be a positive role model for their children why not you

today many will choose to free themselves from the personal imprisonment of their bad habits why not you

today many will choose to live free of conditions and rules governing their own happiness why not you

today many will find abundance in simplicity why not you

today many will be confronted by difficult moral choices and they will choose to do what is right instead of what is beneficial why not you

today many will decide to no longer sit back with a victim mentality but to take charge of their lives and make positive changes why not you

today many will take the action necessary to make a difference why not you

today many will make the commitment to be a better mother father son daughter student teacher worker boss brother sister  so much more why not you

today is a new day

many will seize this day

many will live it to the fullest

why not you

too often we underestimate the power of a touch a smile a kind word a

listening ear an honest compliment or the smallest act of caring all

of which have the potential to turn a life around

losing your life is not the worst thing that can happen the worst thing is to lose your reason for living

most of us must learn to love people and use things rather than loving things and using people

it takes sunshine and rain to make a rainbow there would be no rainbows without sunshine and rain

when one has a grateful heart life is so beautiful

six hundred and forty fish later the only thing i know is everything you love will die the first time you meet someone special you can count on them one day being dead and in the ground

some things cannot be taught they must be experienced you never learn the most valuable lessons in life until you go through your own journey

it doesnt matter what you did or where you wereit matters where you are and what youre doing get out there sing the song in your heart and never let anyone shut you up

you cannot control what happens to you but you can control your attitude

toward what happens to you and in that you will be mastering change rather

than allowing it to master you

life is a tapestry woven by the decisions we make

all knowledge is worth having

there is no time for cutanddried monotony there is time for work and time for love that leaves no other time

our battered suitcases were piled on the sidewalk again we had longer ways to go but no matter the road is life

i’ve come to the conclusion that people who wear headphones while they walk are much happier more confident and more beautiful individuals than someone making the solitary drudge to work without acknowledging their own interests and power

life unfortunately doesnt seem to care what we want

life is nothing without a little chaos to make it interesting

challenge and adversity are meant to help you know who you are storms hit your weakness but unlock your true strength

nothing makes a person happier than having a happy heart

earths crammed with heaven

but only he who sees takes off his shoes

the great object of life is sensation to feel that we exist even though in pain

to move to breathe to fly to float

to gain all while you give

to roam the roads of lands remote

to travel is to live

take it moment by moment and you will find that we are all as i’ve said before bugs in amber

if you have a dream don’t just sit there gather courage to believe that you can succeed and leave no stone unturned to make it a reality

i wish to weep

but sorrow is

i wish to believe

but belief is a

never allow a person to tell you no who doesnt have the power to say

when you do something noble and beautiful and nobody noticed do not be sad for the sun every morning is a beautiful spectacle and yet most of the audience still sleeps

the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera

perhaps  i want the old days back again and theyll never come back and i am haunted by the memory of them and of the world falling about my ears

it doesn’t matter how many times you get knocked down all that matters is you get up one more time than you were knocked down

writing is a form of therapy sometimes i wonder how all those who do not write compose or paint can manage to escape the madness melancholia the panic and fear which is inherent in a human situation

people die i think but your relationship with them doesnt it continues and is everchanging

it takes guts and humility to admit mistakes admitting were wrong is courage not weakness

its not hard to decide what you want your life to be about whats hard she said is figuring out what youre willing to give up in order to do the things you really care about

we never know which lives we influence or when or why

if you live each day as it was your last someday youll most certainly be right

he had the look of one who had drunk the cup of life and found a dead beetle at the bottom

when you come out of the storm you won’t be the same person who walked in that’s what this storm’s all about

hearing voices no one else can hear isnt a good sign even in the wizarding world

how can i go forward when i dont know which way im facing

look i have a strategy why expect anything if you don’t expect anything you don’t get disappointed

all the adversity ive had in my life all my troubles and obstacles have strengthened me you may not realize it when it happens but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you

and when all the wars are over a butterfly will still be beautiful

the mistakes ive made are dead to me but i cant take back the things i never did

changing your outside world cannot make you happy if you are an unhappy person the real personal change can only happen from the inside out if you firstly create the change within yourself you can turn your life around

this whole santa claus thing just doesnt make sense why all the secrecy why all the mystery

if the guy exists why doesnt he ever show himself and prove it

and if he doesnt exist whats the meaning of all this

i dunno isnt this a religious holiday

yeah but actually ive got the same questions about god

mistakes are after all the foundations of truth and if a man does not know what a thing is it is at least an increase in knowledge if he knows what it is not

o me o life of the questions of these recurring

of the endless trains of the faithless—of cities fill’d with the foolish

of myself forever reproaching myself for who more foolish than i and who more faithless

of eyes that vainly crave the light—of the objects mean—of the struggle ever renew’d

of the poor results of all—of the plodding and sordid crowds i see around me

of the empty and useless years of the rest—with the rest me intertwined

the question o me so sad recurring—what good amid these o me o life

that you are here—that life exists and identity

that the powerful play goes on and you will contribute a verse

we should forgive our enemies but not before they are hanged

failure is a bend in the road not the end of the road learn from failure and keep moving forward

when defeat comes accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound rebuild those plans and set sail once more toward your coveted goal

until you step into the unknown you don’t know what you’re made of

the beautiful journey of today can only begin when we learn to let go of yesterday

be still sad heart and cease repining

behind the clouds is the sun still shining

thy fate is the common fate of all

into each life some rain must fall

the aim of life is selfdevelopment to realize ones nature perfectly  that is what each of us is here for

character — the willingness to accept responsibility for ones own life — is the source from which selfrespect springs

you are someone who is different but who wants to be the same as everyone else and that in my view is a serious illness god chose you to be different why are you disappointing god with this kind of attitude

people are strange they are constantly angered by trivial things but on a major matter like totally wasting their lives they hardly seem to notice

can you remember who you were before the world told you who you should be

the cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse

power does not corrupt fear corrupts perhaps the fear of a loss of power

you cant be brave if youve only had wonderful things happen to you

you have wakened not out of sleep but into a prior dream and that dream lies within another and so on to infinity which is the number of grains of sand the path that you are to take is endless and you will die before you have truly awakened

you were made by god and for god and until you understand that life will never make sense

a man is like a novel until the very last page you dont know how it will end otherwise it wouldnt even be worth reading

stop doing what is easy start doing what is right

dont own so much clutter that you will be relieved to see your house catch fire

no single event can awaken within us a stranger whose existence we had never suspected to live is to be slowly born

madame all stories if continued far enough end in death and he is no truestory teller who would keep that from you

nothing ever happens quickly except when it does nothing is ever ever easy except when it is and most of all nothing ever goes perfectly according to plan except in the movies

you learn something valuable from all of the significant events and people but you never touch your true potential until you challenge yourself to go beyond imposed limitations

dont wait for the right moment to start start and make each moment right

don’t wait for things to happen make them happen

good things happen in your life when you surround yourself with positive people

what you stay focused on will grow

good people see the good and bring out the best in other people

those who hurt others will also hurt themselves

we should count time by heartthrobs he most lives

who thinks most feels noblest acts the best

let me give you a tip on a clue to mens characters the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably the man who respects it has earned it

enjoy every step you take if youre curious there is always something new to be discovered in the backdrop of your daily life

my expectations were reduced to zero when i was  everything since then has been a bonus

the science of secondguessing new york times magazine interview december

if you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same then everything that happens in between can be dealt with

i hate to say it but shit really does happen you just have to get over it beat the hell out of it by doing things that make you happy

when i lost my sight werner people said i was brave when my father left people said i was brave but it is not bravery i have no choice i wake up and live my life dont you do the same

we are unusual and tragic and alive

personally i don’t like inherently happy people i don’t trust them i think there’s something seriously wrong with anyone who isn’t at least a little let down by the world

effective ways to make others feel important

use their name

do more listening than talking

talk more about them than about you

be authentically interested

be sincere in your praise

show you care

dont live down to expectations go out there and do something remarkable

the hardest thing about the road not taken is that you never know where it might have led

you made me feel alive again

if the path before you is clear youre probably on someone elses

hard is trying to rebuild yourself piece by piece with no instruction book and no clue as to where all the important bits are supposed to go

pulvis et umbra sumus we are but dust and shadow

when things do not go your way remember that every challenge — every adversity — contains within it the seeds of opportunity and growth

all the worlds a stage and most of us are desperately unrehearsed

make the most of the best and the best of the worst and keep your standards high never settle for anything less than you deserve or are capable of achieving

dare i say i miss him i do i miss him i still see him in my dreams they are nightmares mostly but nightmares tinged with love

i still cannot understand how he could abandon me so unceremoniously without any sort of goodbye without looking back even once that pain is like an axe that chops at my heart

the one who falls and gets up is stronger than the one who never tried do not fear failure but rather fear not trying

oh if you’re a bird be an early bird

and catch the worm for your breakfast plate

if you’re a bird be an early early bird

but if you’re a worm sleep late

so much working reading thinking living to do a lifetime is not long enough

do you believe a man can truly love a woman and constantly betray hernever mind physically but betray her in his mindin the very poetry of his soulwellits not easy but men do it all the time

do not let the roles you play in life make you forget who you are

we lead our lives like water flowing down a hill going more or less in one direction until we splash into something that forces us to find a new course

you were born to stand out stop trying to fit in

this is how the entire course of a life can be changed by doing nothing

i know its not easy for you living this life but try to remember always try to remember youre not the only one with troubles

there are a lot of things i wish i would have done instead of just sitting around and complaining about having a boring life

one way of looking at speech is to say that it is a constant stratagem to cover nakedness

we unaccustomed to courage

exiles from delight

until love leaves its high holy temple

and comes into our sight

to liberate us into life

and in its train come ecstasies

yet if we are bold

love strikes away the chains of fear

from our souls

we are weaned from our timidity

in the flush of loves light

we dare be brave

and suddenly we see

that love costs all we are

and will ever be

yet it is only love

which sets us free

one swallow does not make a summer neither does one fine day similarly one day or brief time of happiness does not make a person entirely happy

everyone enjoys being acknowledged and appreciated sometimes even the simplest act of gratitude can change someones entire day take the time to recognize and value the people around you and appreciate those who make a difference in your lives

life will defend itself no matter how small it is

our lives cant be measured by our final years of this i am sure

so this is for us

this is for us who sing write dance act study run and love

and this is for doing it even if no one will ever know

because the beauty is in the act of doing it

not what it can lead to

and no one is around and they will never know

but i will forever remember

and that shines brighter than any praise or fame or glory i will ever have

and this is for you who write or play or read or sing

by yourself with the light off and door closed

when the world is asleep and the stars are aligned

and maybe no one will ever hear it

or read your words

or know your thoughts

it makes it ethereal mysterious

for it belongs to you and whatever god or spirit you believe in

and only you can decide how much it meant

and means

and will forever mean

and other people will experience it too

through you

through your spirit through the way you talk

through the way you walk and love and laugh and care

where no one will ever hear

and your very existence will be the most hypnotising scar

make your life be your art

and you will never be forgotten

this life one day but it’s how

many things we have to quit

all at once music laughter

the physics of falling leaves

the scent of rain the concept

of subway trains if only one

could leave this life slowly

i believe in looking reality straight in the eye and denying it

let all of life be an unfettered howl

i am nothing more than the consequence of catastrophe

always forgive but never forget else you will be a prisoner of your own hatred and doomed to repeat your mistakes forever

a joke is a very serious thing

develop an attitude of gratitude and give thanks for everything that happens to

you knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something

bigger and better than your current situation

i haven’t been very impressed lately

by people

or places

or the way someone said he loved me and then slowly changed his mind

the irony of life is that those who wear masks often tell us more truths than those with open faces

when you arise in the morning think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive—to breathe to think to enjoy to love—then make that day count

life will hit you hard in the face wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach but getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air

life is  percent what you make it

and  percent how you take it

life seems to go on without effort when i am filled with music

love is forgiving accepting moving on embracing and all encompassing and if you’re not doing that for yourself you cannot do that with anyone else

by the way when oprah winfrey is suggesting you may have overextended yourself you need to examine your fucking life

everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content

be where you are stop overthinking and focus on what you are doing

love the trees until their leaves fall off then encourage them to try again next year

and if youve managed to drag yourself from the bed and go down the road to the garden center or the drug store by then the worst is over at that point you might as well just go to work

the greatest step towards a life of simplicity is to learn to let go

life isn’t about what you get it’s about what you do with what you get

when she is happy she cant stop talking when she is sad she doesnt say a word

life is a long lesson in humility

everyone has his own reality in which if one is not too cautious timid or frightened one swims this is the only reality there is

i do not forget any good deed done to me  i do not carry a grudge for a bad one

those with a grateful mindset tend to see the message in the mess and even though life may knock them down the grateful find reasons if even small ones to get up

remember how it was when we kissed armfuls and armfuls of light thrown right at us a rope dropping down from the sky how can the word love and the word life even fit in the mouth

i have a deeply hidden and inarticulate desire for something beyond the daily life

now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good god would permit us to be pirates

when you are measuring life you are not living it

thats the thing about life a lot of the time it isnt easy at all we just have to try to make the best of it

despite the mayhem that followed bruno found that he was still holding shmuels hand in his own and nothing in the world would have persuaded him to let go

may you live as long as you wish and love as long as you live

beauty is a whore i like money better

we have nothing to lose nothing to gain nothing we desired anymore except to make our lives into a work of art

who would have guessed that four minutes could change everything

live and act within the limit of your knowledge and keep expanding it to the limit of your life

dancers are the athletes of god

your life is happening right now dont let procrastination take over your life be brave and take risks your life is happening right now

my love is pizza shaped won’t you have a slice it’s circular so there’s enough to go around

another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing

i still find each day too short for all the thoughts i want to think all the walks i want to take all the books i want to read and all the friends i want to see

i love the lord for he heard my voice he heard my cry for mercy because he turned his ear to me i will call on him as long as i live psalms  niv

pain or love or danger makes you real again

dignity is as essential to human life as water food and oxygen the stubborn retention of it even in the face of extreme physical hardship can hold a mans soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it

the lord prefers commonlooking people that is why he made so many of them

i am not good at noticing when im happy except in retrospect

the end is in the beginning and yet you go on

you will suffer son of hades’

what else is new nico thought

the life where nothing was ever unexpected or inconvenient or unusual the life without colour pain or past

we should live our lives as though christ was coming this afternoon

look for the good in every person and every situation youll almost always

find it

when you lose your smile you lose your way in the chaos of life

life’s greatest gift is the freedom it leaves you to step out of it whenever you choose

the fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence

to invent your own lifes meaning is not easy but its still allowed and i think youll be happier for the trouble

its such a shame to waste time we always think we have so much of it

you know how both life and porno movies end the only difference is life starts with the orgasm

id found out that if you pushed people away hard enough they tended to go

i want to be the best version of myself for anyone who is going to someday walk into my life and need someone to love them beyond reason

life isnt worth living unless it is lived for someone else

i cant you cant rewrite the past

when it was over she gathered him in her arms and told him the terrible irony of her life

that she had wanted to be dead all those years while her brother had been alive that had been her sin

and this was her penance

wanting to live when everyone else seemed dead

to overcome fear is the quickest way to gain your selfconfidence

be careful the stories youre telling yourself about your current circumstances a head full of negative thoughts has no space for positive ones

and these children that you spit on

as they try to change their worlds

are immune to your consultations

theyre quite aware of what theyre going through

ive come to believe that in everyones life theres one undeniable moment of change a set of circumstances that suddenly alters everything

depression isnt a war you win its a battle you fight every day you never stop never get to rest its one bloody fray after another

after you find out all the things that can go wrong your life becomes less about living and more about waiting

turning your back on

if you love it

at  everyone has the face he deserves

here’s to freedom cheers to art here’s to having an excellent adventure and may the stopping never start

can a person steal happiness or is just another internal infernal human trick

when forever becomes a placewhen forever ceases to be just a word… when it ceases to be just a measurement of time…but instead becomes a place where soul mates can dance to the song in their hearts that is a reflection of true love

while we try to teach our children all about life our children teach us what life is all about

you dont ask people with knives in their stomachs what would make them happy happiness is no longer the point its all about survival its all about whether you pull the knife out and bleed to death or keep it in

life is full of grief to exactly the degree we allow ourselves to love other people

all of us have a place in history mine is clouds

if you care about something enough youll find a way to make it happen

never try to do anything that is outside of who you are a forced smile is a sign of what feels wrong in your heart so recognize it when it happens living a lie will reduce you to one

thats the problem with life you never get enough time to stare at your ceiling and try to figure out whats going on

not that kind of screwed what i mean is theyre always on the short end of things

the way things work how

guys feel great but make girls feel

cheap for doing

exactly what

they beg for

the way they get to play you

all the while claiming they

love you and making you

believe its

the way its okay to gift their heart one day a backhand the next

to move on to the apricot

when the peach blushes and bruises

these things make me believe gods a man after all

we are all ordinary we are all boring we are all spectacular we are all shy we are all bold we are all heroes we are all helpless it just depends on the day

i don’t chase after anyone if you wanna walk out of my life then i’ll hold the fucking door open for you

let go of something old that no longer serves you to make room for something new

if you cant control your peanut butter you cant expect to control your life

dont worry be happy

you fear to die

its not that i dont want i mean ive alwaysits just that life is a habit thats hard to break

and for better

it wasnt easy the world was complicated life was hard and so often living hurt

so make it worth the pain

dreams are necessary to life

one of the greatest journeys in life is overcoming insecurity and learning to truly not give a shit

this work was strictly voluntary but any animal who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half

i hope you live a life you’re proud of if you find that you’re not i hope you have the strength to start all over again

it has shown me that everything is illuminated in the light of the past it is always along the side of uson the inside looking out

i dont want to do anything i dont even want to start this day because then ill just be expected to finish it

droll thing life is  that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose the most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself  that comes too late  a crop of inextinguishable regrets

she had been given a wonderful gift life sometimes it was cruelly taken away too soon but its what you did with it that counted not how long it lasted

it is not worth the while to let our imperfections disturb us always

i never ask a man what his business is for it never interests me what i ask him about are his thoughts and dreams

in fairy tales the princesses kiss the frogs and the frogs become princes in real life the pricesses kiss princes and the princes turn into frogs

after youre gone people will forget your name no matter how important it was and your face no matter how pretty it was and what you said no matter how clever any of it sounded

the things youve done will crumble and fade and the places you once loved will change and be given new names

you are only here for one moment and it lasts exactly one lifetime

no man ever threw away life while it was worth keeping

my only regrets are the moments when i doubted myself and took the safe route life is too short to waste time being unhappy

the true hypocrite is the one who ceases to perceive his deception the one who lies with sincerity

youve never lived what you are thinking and that isnt good only the ideas we actually live are of any value

we live in a dark and romantic and quite tragic world

i came here looking for a great perhaps for real friends and a morethanminor life

its easy to look back and see it and its easy to give the advice but the sad fact is most people dont look beneath the surface until its too late

if you only shine light on your flaws all your perfects will dim

one can be very much in love with a woman without wishing to spend the rest of ones life with her

there is no such thing as worklife balance everything worth fighting for unbalances your life

everything changes in my life and the world stays the same

i’m a fake fact factory the things i make are the things i make up also as a side business i make love actually i just made that up

it is wise to direct your anger towards problems  not people to focus your energies on answers  not excuses

give a bowl of rice to a man and you will feed him for a day teach him how to grow his own rice and you will save his life

some beautiful paths cant be discovered without getting lost

you often meet your fate on the road you take to avoid it

sorrow looks back worry looks around faith looks up

to regret one’s own experiences is to arrest one’s own development to deny one’s own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of one’s own life it is no less than a denial of the soul

you might want to decide fast we live in a dangerous world if you see a chance to be happy you have to fight for it so later you have no regrets

fate loves the fearless

the problem of course was that he saw the world in black and white and he got to decide what was black and what was white you cant love a person who lives that way without fearing him too maybe even hating him a little

the moon did her best she carved each of these blocks of sorrow into a man or a woman she spent the rest of her time watching out so that her other stars wouldnt fall she spent the rest of her time holding onto whatever scraps she had left

i do not love men i love what devours them

the trick is to enjoy life dont wish away your days waiting for better ones ahead

do you ever wonder whether people would like you more or less if they could see inside you but i always wonder about that if people could see me the way i see myself—if they could live in my memories—would anyone anyone love me

focus on making yourself better not on thinking that you are better

anything can happen in life especially nothing

rise to the occassion which is life

thats what i love about aibileen she can take the most complicated things in life and wrap them up so small and simple theyll fit right in your pocket

she felt how life from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up with it and threw one down with it there with a dash on the beach

did you ever when you were little endure your parents’ warnings then wait for them to leave the room pry loose protective covers and consider inserting some metal object into an electrical outlet

did you wonder if for once you might light up the room

when you were big enough to cross the street on your own did you ever wait for a signal hear the frenzied approach of a fire truck and feel like stepping out in front of it

did you wonder just how far that rocket ride might take you

when you were almost grown did you ever sit in a bubble bath perspiration pooling notice a blow dryer plugged in within easy reach and think about dropping it into the water

did you wonder if the expected rush might somehow fail you

and now do you ever dangle your toes over the precipice dare the cliff to crumble defy the frozen deity to suffer the sun thaw feather and bone take wing to fly you home

sometimes things happen to people and theyre not equipped to deal with them

if people do not believe that mathematics is simple it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is

we are the cosmos made conscious and life is the means by which the universe understands itself

life—the way it really is—is a battle not between good and bad but between bad and worse

all the worlds a stage

and all the men and women merely players

they have their exits and their entrances

and one man in his time plays many parts

his acts being seven ages at first the infant

mewling and puking in the nurses arms

then the whining schoolboy with his satchel

and shining morning face creeping like snail

unwillingly to school and then the lover

sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad

made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier

full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard

jealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel

seeking the bubble reputation

even in the cannons mouth and then the justice

in fair round belly with good capon lined

with eyes severe and beard of formal cut

full of wise saws and modern instances

and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts

into the lean and slippered pantaloon

with spectacles on nose and pouch on side

his youthful hose well saved a world too wide

for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice

turning again toward childish treble pipes

and whistles in his sound last scene of all

that ends this strange eventful history

is second childishness and mere oblivion

art is the reason i get up in the morning but the definition ends there it doesnt seem fair that im living for something i cant even define

i believe when life gives you lemons you should make lemonadeand try to find someone whose life has given them vodka and have a party

freedom is the only worthy goal in life it is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control

i dont pray really because i dont want to bore god

i would not have you descend into your own dream i would have you be a conscious citizen of this terrible and beautiful world

no matter where you are youre always a bit on your own always an outsider

one who makes himself a worm cannot complain afterwards if people step on him

don’t let mental blocks control you set yourself free confront your fear and turn the mental blocks into building blocks

to live is to be musical starting with the blood dancing in your veins everything living has a rhythm do you feel your music

millions long for immortality who dont know what to do with themselves on a rainy sunday afternoon

you can be young without money but you cant be old without it

if someone does not want me it is not the end of the world but if i do not want me the world is nothing but endings

chiron had said once that nations were the most foolish of mortal inventions no man is worth more than another wherever he is from

but what if he is your friend achilles had asked him feet kicked up on the wall of the rosequartz cave or your brother should you treat him the same as a stranger

you ask a question that philosophers argue over chiron had said he is worth more to you perhaps but the stranger is someone else’s friend and brother so which life is more important

we had been silent we were fourteen and these things were too hard for us now that we are twentyseven they still feel too hard

he is half of my soul as the poets say he will be dead soon and his honor is all that will remain it is his child his dearest self should i reproach him for it i have saved briseis i cannot save them all

i know now how i would answer chiron i would say there is no answer whichever you choose you are wrong

there are things that will never change things we will carry along with us always but as we venture into the murky future we must find our strength by learning to leave things behind

were so engaged in doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget the inner value the rapture that is associated with being alive is what it is all about

please touch me i pray

life is more fun if you play games

life doesnt require ideals it requires standards of action

instead of worrying about what could go wrong change your thoughts to what could go right when you change the negative thought into a positive one it eliminates the negative one

love and friendship they are what make us who we are and what can change us if we let them

along with the idea of romantic love she was introduced to anotherphysical beauty probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought both originated in envy thrived in insecurity and ended in disillusion

be so good they cant ignore you

your time may come do not be too sad sam you cannot be always torn in two you will have to be one and whole for many years you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do

never compete with someone who has nothing to lose

you have stories worth telling memories worth remembering dreams worth working toward a body worth feeding a soul worth tending and beyond that the god of the universe dwells within you the true culmination of super and natural

you are more than dust and bones

you are spirit and power and image of god

and you have been given today

that’s life for you all the happiness you gather to yourself it will sweep away like it’s nothing if you ask me i don’t think there are any such things as curses i think there is only life that’s enough

you dont know me you know one me just like i know one you and you cant know every me and i cant know every you

the fact that life has no meaning is a reason to live moreover the only one

single is no longer a lack of options – but a choice a choice to refuse to let your life be defined by your relationship status but to live every day happily and let your ever after work itself out

perfection of character is this to live each day as if it were your last without frenzy without apathy without pretence

when we fail to set boundaries and hold people accountable we feel used and mistreated this is why we sometimes attack who they are which is far more hurtful than addressing a behavior or a choice

life is like a grapefruit well its sort of orangeyyellow and dimpled on the outside wet and squidgy in the middle its got pips inside too oh and some people have half a one for breakfast

it is after all so easy to shatter a story to break a chain of thought to ruin a fragment of a dream being carried around carefully like a piece of porcelain to let it be to travel with it as velutha did is much the harder thing to do

its good to let god pick a man for you we dont do so well when we pick them ourselves they end up lipsticks in a drawer all those wrong colors you thought looked so good in the package

exactly said deep thought so once you do know what the question actually is youll know what the answer means

the connections we make in the course of a lifemaybe thats what heaven is

do not look back and grieve over the past for it is gone and do not be troubled about the future for it has yet to come live in the present and make it so beautiful that it will be worth remembering

disappointment came to me

and booted me

and bruised and hurt me

but thats how people grow up

you don’t get to pick where you’re from but you always have control of where you’re going

life is partly what we make it and partly what it is made by the friends we choose

the monsters were never

under my bed

because the monsters

were inside my head

i fear no monsters

for no monsters i see

because all this time

the monster has been me

the bounties of space of infinite outwardness were three empty heroics low comedy and pointless death

you make the world a better place by making daily improvements to become the best version of yourself

my heart is afraid that it will have to suffer

people are going to say what they want to say and think what they want to think and i cant change their minds

maybe you could be mine  or maybe we’ll be entwined  aimless in this sexless foreplay

for beautiful eyes look for the good in others for beautiful lips speak only words of kindness and for poise walk with the knowledge that you are never alone

i saw the world from the stars point of view and it looked unbearably lonely

the world will give you that once in awhile a brief timeout the boxing bell rings and you go to your corner where somebody dabs mercy on your beatup life

happiness is part of who we are joy is the feeling

go for it while you can i know you have it in you and i cant promise youll get everything you want but i can promise nothing will change if you dont try

the most important relationship in your life is the relationship you have with yourself because no matter what happens you will always be with yourself

good works is giving to the poor and the helpless but divine works is showing them their worth to the one who matters

gamble everything for love if youre a true human being

when all is said and done the life of faith is nothing if not an unending struggle of the spirit with every available weapon against the flesh

i wonder if thats how darkness wins by convincing us to trap it inside ourselves instead of emptying it out

i dont want it to win

to live is to war with trolls

no matter how hard life is dont lose hope

and were an epitaph to be my story id have a short one ready for my own i would have written of me on my stone i had a lovers quarrel with the world

she smiled and said with an ecstatic air it shines like a little diamond

what does

this moment it is round it hangs in empty space like a little diamond i am eternal

the deepest wounds arent the ones we get from other people hurting us they are the wounds we give ourselves when we hurt other people

have you ever hoped for something and held out for it against all the odds until everything you did was ridiculous

some say life is the thing but i prefer reading

what helps you persevere is your resilience and commitment

no’ nico said ‘getting a second life is one thing making it a better life that’s the trick’ as soon as he said it nico realized he could’ve been talking about himself he decided not to bring that up

there are things you cant walk away from not if you want to live with yourself afterward

each time we dont say what we wanna say were dying

how can you still count yourself a knight when you have forsaken every vow you ever swore

sometimes life is very mean a person can spend days weeks months and years without feeling new then when a door opens  a positive avalanche pours in one moment you have nothing the next you have more than you can cope with

the behavior of a human being in sexual matters is often a prototype for the whole of his other modes of reaction in life

you dont dwell on what youve lost you just move onallison

an ability to look into the confusing mess of life and see things for what they are

you look ridiculous if you dance

you look ridiculous if you dont dance

so you might as well

a home filled with nothing but yourself its heavy that lightness its crushing that emptiness

einmal ist keinmal says tomas to himself what happens but once says the german adage might as well not have happened at all if we have only one life to live we might as well not have lived at all

i like shape very much a novel has to have shape and life doesnt have any

i am old enough to know only too well my good and bad qualities which were often one in the same

time ticks by we grow older before we know it too much time has passed and weve missed the chance to have had other people hurt us to a younger me this sounded like luck to an older me this sounds like a quiet tragedy

when you say i and my too much you lose the capacity to understand the we and our

it would be so nice if something made sense for a change

if fate doesnt make you laugh you just dont get the joke

you are never alone you are eternally connected with everyone

we cant become what we need to be by remaining what we are

a woman laughing is a woman conquered

regret is mostly caused by not having

sometimes you have to be a bitch to get things done

security is mostly a superstition it does not exist in nature nor do the children of men as a whole experience it avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure life is either a daring adventure or nothing

i know there may be universes out there where i made different choices and they led me somewhere else led me to someone else and my heart breaks for every single version of me that didnt end up with you

home is where somebody notices when you are no longer there

good memories are like charmseach is special you collect them one by one until one day you look back and discover they make a long colorful bracelet

were all made of stories when they finally put us underground the stories are what will go on not forever perhaps but for a time its a kind of immortality i suppose bounded by limits its true but then sos everything

why did i write because i found life unsatisfactory

if something doesnt work exactly right or maybe needs some special treatment you dont just throw it away everything cant be fully operational all the time sometimes we need to have the patience to give something the little nudge it needs

i run after her not really giving chase i’m running because i can because i must

because i want to see how far i can go before i have to stop

whatever is going to happen will happen whether we worry or not

a feeling is no longer the same when it comes the second time it dies through the awareness of its return we become tired and weary of our feelings when they come too often and last too long

theres nothing wrong with not understanding yourself

you enter the forest

at the darkest point

where there is no path

where there is a way or path

it is someone elses path

you are not on your own path

if you follow someone elses way

you are not going to realize

your potential

realize deeply that the present moment is all you will ever have

it is a curious situation that the sea from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life but the sea though changed in a sinister way will continue to exist the threat is rather to life itself

dont wish it was easier wish you were better dont wish for less problems wish for more skills dont wish for less challenge wish for more wisdom

two wrongs dont make a right but dont three lefts make a right two wrongs dont make a right but dont two negatives make a positive

you stay safe you love you survive you laugh and cry and struggle and sometimes you fail and sometimes you succeed you push

believe in your infinite potential your only limitations are those you set upon yourself

believe in yourself your abilities and your own potential never let selfdoubt hold you captive you are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for

everything you do is triggered by an emotion of either desire or fear

plato says that the unexamined life is not worth living but what if the examined life turns out to be a clunker as well

see the poor dream all their lives of getting enough to eat and looking like the rich and what do the rich dream of losing weight and looking like the poor

it’s strange how things can change back as suddenly as they changed originally when one thing happens and suddenly things are back to normal

i believe that i am not responsible for the meaningfulness or meaninglessness of life but that i am responsible for what i do with the life ive got

the path to success is to take massive determined action

we have to lie to ourselves to live otherwise wed go crazy

no matter how qualified or deserving we are we will never reach a better life until we can imagine it for ourselves and allow ourselves to have it

you’ll be fine you’re  feeling unsure and lost is part of your path don’t avoid it see what those feelings are showing you and use it take a breath you’ll be okay even if you don’t feel okay all the time

if people make fun of you that probably means youre doing something right

you attract who you are being when you work at being the type of person that you want to attract you attract those kinds of people into your life

if you have kindness in your heart you offer acts of kindness to touch the hearts of others wherever you go—whether they are random or planned kindness becomes a way of life

nostalgia in reverse the longing for yet another strange land grew especially strong in spring

a man travels the world over in search of what he needs and returns home to find it

i love you even if there isn’t any me or any love or even any life i love you

love only grows by sharing you can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others

there’s a really stupid saying when life hands you a lemon make lemonade well i have a better saying when life hands you a lemon shove that lemon up its stupid butt

i need one of those chapter breaks i just want to catch my breath but i have no idea how

if after i die people want to write my biography there is nothing simpler they only need two dates the date of my birth and the date of my death between one and another every day is mine

i simply regard romantic comedies as a subgenre of scifi in which the world created therein has different rules than my regular human world

theres more to life than love

whether we like it or not the one justification for the existence of all religions is death they need death as much as we need bread to eat

it is beautiful it is endless it is full and yet seems empty it hurts us

no matter how much you love someone you still want to have you own way

there are some values that you should never compromise on to stay true to yourself you should be brave to stand up for what you truly believe in even if you stand alone

single is an opportunity to live life on your own terms and not apologize

accidents dont happen to people who take accidents as a personal insult

every challenge you face today makes you stronger tomorrow the challenge of life is intended to make you better not bitter

and meanwhile time goes about its immemorial work of making everyone look and feel like shit

the true mystery of the world is the visible not the invisible

sometimes bad things have to happen before good things can

i think that if the world were a bit more like comiccon it would be a better place

all i am is literature and i am not able or willing to be anything else

people dont always want to be with people it gets tiring

son are you happy

i dont mean to pry

but do you dream of heaven

have you ever wanted to die

one day ill tell my daughter a story about a dark time the dark days before she was born and how her coming was a ray of light we got lost for a while the story will begin but then we found our way

to find out if she really loved me i hooked her up to a lie detector and just as i suspected my machine was broken

i can’t really act the way i want to act or say what i want to say all the time and a lot of times i cover that up with a smile

she cracked a smile so whats your poison

he sighed dramatically and let the truth tumble off his tongue life

ah she said ruefully thatll kill you

the best use of life is love the best expression of love is time the best time to love is now

life doesnt make any sense and we all pretend it does comedys job is to point out that it doesnt make sense and that it doesnt make much difference anyway

there is love of course and then theres life its enemy

this place is a dream only a sleeper considers it real then death comes like dawn and you wake up laughing at what you thought was your grief

desire makes life happen makes it matter makes everything worth it desire is life hunger to see the next sunrise or sunset to touch the one you love to try again

hell would be waking up and wanting nothing he agrees

i dont judge people

it blurs out the center of my attention

my focus

myself

life is a series of surprises and would not be worth taking or keeping if it were not

what we like to think of ourselves and what we really are rarely have much in common

we must all suffer from one of two pains the pain of discipline or the pain of regret the difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons

life is like an onion you peel it off one layer at a time and sometimes you weep

the desire to love someone always exceeds the desire to be loved by someone  thats exactly why we end up loving the person who doesnt deserve that love

you said we all want there to be more than this well theres always more than this theres always something you dont know

everybody know death is inevitably coming but it never fails to catch everybody by surprise everytime one is going

you have come a long way and have won many battles whenever you’re faced with a difficult or challenging situation you’ll overcome it yes you can

like gravity karma is so basic we often dont even notice it

theres a sorrow and pain in everyones life but every now and then theres a ray of light that melts the loneliness in your heart and brings comfort like hot soup and a soft bed

i have stitched life into me like a rare organ

from three women a poem for three voices written

what if im in charge of my own damn light switch

there is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life and beyond which life cannot rise and such is the paradox of living this ecstasy comes when one is most alive and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive

he stood at the window of the empty cafe and watched the activites in the square and he said that it was good that god kept the truths of life from the young as they were starting out or else theyd have no heart to start at all

mathematics expresses values that reflect the cosmos including orderliness balance harmony logic and abstract beauty

discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment

rise and rise again until lambs become lions

but i can hardly sit still i keep fidgeting crossing one leg and then the other i feel like i could throw off sparks or break a windowmaybe rearrange all the furniture

let others lead small lives but not you let others argue over small things but not you let others cry over small hurts but not you let others leave their future in someone elses hands but not you

you wont lag behind because youll have the speed

youll pass the whole gang and youll soon take the lead

wherever you fly youll be best of the best

wherever you go you will top all the rest

except when you dont

because sometimes you wont

right now i had everything i could ask for it wasnt a long list but it was a very satisfying one starting with the love of my life back in my arms

to believe you are magnificent and gradually to discover that you are not magnificent enough labor for one human life

i finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it

if you don’t like the road you’re walking start paving another one

totally without hope one cannot live to live without hope is to cease to live hell is hopelessness it is no accident that above the entrance to dantes hell is the inscription leave behind all hope you who enter here

life consists of two days one for you one against you so when its for you dont be proud or reckless and when its against you be patient for both days are test for you

i am a person who is unhappy with things as they stand we cannot accept the world as it is each day we should wake up foaming at the mouth because of the injustice of things

lately i cant help wanting us

to be like other people

for example if i were a smoker

youd lift a match to the cigarette

just as i put it between my lips

its never been like that

between us none of that

easy chemistry no quick half automatic

flares everything between us

had to be learned

behind my book all my fantasies

of seduction run up

against the rocks

tell me again

why you dont like

sex in the afternoon

no dont tell me

ill never understand you

never understand us americas strangest

loving couple they never

and rarely look at each other

into each others eyes i mean

the way i define happiness is being the creator of your experience choosing to take pleasure in what you have right now regardless of the circumstances while being the best you that you can be

make the most of what you have and keep your standards high never settle for anything less than you deserve or are capable of achieving

life is like a play its not the length but the excellence of the acting that matters

there are no conditions to which a person cannot grow accustomed especially if he sees that everyone around him lives in the same way

perhaps it would be simpler if you just did what youre told and didnt try to understand things

life keeps throwing me lemons because i make the best lemonade

you need just the right amount of fuck the world and the right amount of belief in somethingand you need the right amount of love

your greatest self has been waiting your whole life dont make it wait any longer

it is not so much the major events as the small daytoday decisions that map the course of our living   our lives are in reality the sum total of our seemingly unimportant decisions and of our capacity to live by those decisions

keep your promises and be consistent be the kind of person others can trust

i am almost a hundred years old waiting for the end and thinking about the beginning

there are things i need to tell you but would you listen if i told you how quickly time passes

i know you are unable to imagine this

how would your life be different if…you approached all relationships with authenticity and honesty let today be the day…you dedicate yourself to building relationships on the solid foundation of truth and authenticity

if you believe you can you might if you know you can you will

i know i wrote letters to people with no address on this earth i know that you are dead but i hear you i hear all of you we were here our lives matter

find someone who has a life that you want and figure out how they got it read books pick your role models wisely find out what they did and do it

at  years old i started bleeding with the moon

and beating up boys who dreamed of becoming astronauts

i fought with my knuckles white as stars

and left bruises the shape of salem

there are things we know by heart

and things we dont

at  my friend jen tried to teach me how to blow rings of smoke

id watch the nicotine rising from her lips like halos

but i could never make dying beautiful

the sky didnt fill with colors the night i convinced myself

veins are kite strings you can only cut free

i suppose i love this life

in spite of my clenched fist

i open my palm and my lifelines look like branches from an aspen tree

and there are songbirds perched on the tips of my fingers

and i wonder if beethoven held his breath

the first time his fingers touched the keys

the same way a soldier holds his breath

the first time his finger clicks the trigger

we all have different reasons for forgetting to breathe

but my lungs remember

the day my mother took my hand and placed it on her belly

and told me the symphony beneath was my baby sisters heartbeat

and i knew life would tremble

like the first tear on a prison guards hardened cheek

like a prayer on a dying mans lips

like a vet holding a full bottle of whisky like an empty gun in a war zone…

just take me just take me

sometimes the scales themselves weigh far too much

the heaviness of forever balancing blue sky with red blood

we were all born on days when too many people died in terrible ways

but you still have to call it a birthday

you still have to fall for the prettiest girl on the playground at recess

and hope she knows you can hit a baseball

further than any boy in the whole third grade

and ive been running for home

through the windpipe of a man who sings

while his hands playing washboard with a spoon

where every boarded up window is still painted with the words

were coming back

like a promise to the ocean

that we will always keep moving towards the music

the way basquait slept in a cardboard box to be closer to the rain

beauty catch me on your tongue

the pupils in our eyes were not born to hide beneath their desks

tonight lay us down to rest in the arizona desert

then wake us washing the feet of pregnant women

who climbed across the border with their bellies aimed towards the sun

i know a thousand things louder than a soldiers gun

i know the heartbeat of his mother

dont cover your ears love

dont cover your ears life

there is a boy writing poems in central park

and as he writes he moves

and his bones become the bars of mandelas jail cell stretching apart

and there are men playing chess in the december cold

who cant tell if the breath rising from the board

is their opponents or their own

and theres a woman on the stairwell of the subway

swearing she can hear niagara falls from her rooftop in brooklyn

and im remembering how niagara falls is a city overrun

with strip malls and traffic and vendors

and one incredibly brave river that makes it all worth it

yall i know this world is far from perfect

i am not the type to mistake a streetlight for the moon

i know our wounds are deep as the atlantic

but every ocean has a shoreline

and every shoreline has a tide

that is constantly returning

to wake the songbirds in our hands

to wake the music in our bones

to place one fearless kiss on the mouth of that brave river

that has to run through the center of our hearts

to find its way home

there are no second chances in life except to feel remorse

i need you to be happy i need one of us to be happy

the spiritual life does not remove us from the world but leads us deeper into it

life is a spark between two identical voids the darkness before birth and the one after death

the only real limitation on your abilities is the level of your desires if you

want it badly enough there are no limits on what you can achieve

one of the best ways to influence people is to make them feel important most people enjoy those rare moments when others make them feel important it is one of the deepest human desires

the past can teach us nurture us but it cannot sustain us the essence of life is change and we must move ever forward or the soul will wither and die

nothing is built on stone all is built on sand but we must build as if the sand were stone

if you want something you can have it but only if you want everything that goes with it including all the hard work and the despair and only if youre willing to risk failure

i believe the stars align so souls can find one another whether they are meant to be souls in love or souls in life remains to be seen

we can regard our life as a uselessly disturbing episode in the blissful repose of nothingness

fear what has a man to do with fear chance rules our lives and the future is all unknown best live as we may from day to day

live all you can its a mistake not to it doesnt matter what you do in particular so long as you have had your life if you havent had that what have you had

you say freak i say unique

dance above the surface of the world let your thoughts lift you into creativity that is not hampered by opinion

there is no standard normal normal is subjective there are seven billion versions of normal on this planet

if youre gonna burn a bridge behind you make sure youve crossed it first

i realize that life is risks it’s acknowledging the past but looking forward it’s taking a chance that we will

make mistakes but believing that we all deserve to be forgiven

rock n roll is not red carpets and myspace friends rocknroll is dangerous and should piss people off

let your life lightly dance on the edges of

time like dew on the tip of a leaf

opening up to the wrong person is like putting ammo in their hands

i want to see beauty in the ugly in the sink in the suffering in the daily in all the days before i die the moments before i sleep

the young man came to the old man seeking counsel

how badly is it broken

its in a million little pieces

im afraid i cant help you

why

theres nothing you can do

why

it cant be fixed

why

its broken beyond repair its in a million little pieces

life has but one true charm the charm of the game but what if we’re indifferent to whether we win or lose

while theres life theres hope

life is only precious because it ends kid take it from a god you mortals dont know how lucky you are

having perfected our disguise we spend our lives searching for someone we don’t fool

our most significant opportunities will be found in times of greatest difficulty

instead of focusing on how much you can accomplish focus on how much you can absolutely love what you’re doing

i wonder if ill ever have to decide which is worse life as were living or no life at all

life is so constructed that the event does not cannot will not match the expectation

love doesnt give you very many choices when you love someone you just want to be with them if they break your heart you will still love them because hearts are easy to break and though love is tender and sometimes fragile love isnt

love addicts you to its feeling you never ever want to lose that feeling sometimes the fear of losing love drives people to do crazy things like buy a plane ticket make a phone call run out of a class cry write laugh

because when you love someone you really love them you give them your whole heart you trust them you never want to be away from them sometimes you dont even need their words you just need them there

love is such an amazing thing and too many people take it for granted if youre in love dont let it go dont you dare let it go

autobiography begins with a sense of being alone it is an orphan form

he said that we belonged together because he was born with a flower and i was born with a butterfly and that flowers and butterflies need each other for survival

you know life fractures us all into little pieces it harms us but its how we glue those fractures back together that make us stronger

i used to wonder if it was gods plan that i should be alone for so much of my life but i found peace i found happiness within people and the world

you dont put your life into your books you find it there

i want to keep my dreams even bad ones because without them i might have nothing all night long

do nothing and nothing happens life is about decisions you either make them or theyre made for you but you cant avoid them

most of what matters in our lives takes place in our absence

everyday is a bank account and time is our currency no one is rich no one is poor weve got  hours each

you once told me

you wanted to find

yourself in the world

and i told you to

to discover the world

within you

you once told me

you wanted to save

the world from all its wars

and i told you to

first save yourself

from the world

and all the wars

you put yourself

through

apply within by suzy kassem

how ridiculous and how strange to be surprised at anything which happens in life

life is short focus on what really matters most you should change your priorities over time

i dont want to live i want to love first and live incidentally

if a man is to live he must be all alive body soul mind heart spirit

because im selfish im a coward im the kind of girl who when she might actually be of use would run to stay alive and leave those who couldnt follow to suffer and die

real life is only ever just real life messy what it means depends on how you look at it the only thing you’ve got to do is find a way to live there

because if youve found meaning in your life you dont want to go back you want to go forward

to me history ought to be a source of pleasure it isnt just part of our civic responsibility to me its an enlargement of the experience of being alive just the way literature or art or music is

the title always comes last neh  jefferson lecturer interview profile

i was lost yesterday i am found today and i will be forgotten tomorrow

end no the journey doesnt end here death is just another path one that we all must take

if you can spend a perfectly useless afternoon in a perfectly useless manner you have learned how to live

besides the noble art of getting things done there is the noble art of leaving things undone the wisdom of life consists in the elimination of nonessentials

the act of taking the first step is what separates the winners from the losers

distance sometimes lets you know who is worth keeping and who is worth letting go

i know there is no straight road

no straight road in this world

only a giant labyrinth

sometimes you need a little crisis to get your adrenaline flowing and help you realize your potential

doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the mext moment

i knew it like destiny and at the same time i knew it as choice

it’s too bad if a heart lacks fire

and is deprived of the light

the day on which you are

is the most wasted day of your life

dont wake me for the end of the world unless it has very good special effects

theres no benchmark for how lifes supposed to happen there is no ideal world for you to wait around for the world is always just what it is now its up to you how you respond to it

she didnt read books so she didnt know that she was the world and the heavens boiled down to a drop

too late i found you cant wait to become perfect you got to go out and fall down and get up with everybody else

hate is nothing when weighed against survival valentine

all any of us wanted really was to know that we counted that someone elses life would not have been as rich without us here

selfconsciousness is the enemy of all art be it acting writing painting or living itself which is the greatest art of all

theres a race of men that dont fit in

a race that cant sit still

so they break the hearts of kith and kin and they roam the world at will

they range the field and rove the flood

and they climb the mountains crest theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood

and they dont know how to rest

the world is not a pleasant place to be without someone to hold and be held by

you wanted to feel alive right it doesnt matter if youre monster or human living hurts

to leave after all was not the same as being left

when all else fails theres always delusion

i am afraid to show you who i really am because if i show you who i really am you might not like itand thats all i got

if you dont learn to laugh at life itll surely kill you that i know

life is a sexually transmitted disease and the mortality rate is one hundred percent

when i grow up i want to be an inventor first i will invent a time machine then ill come back to yesterday and take myself to tomorrow and skip this dumb assignment

even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness

before i can tell my life what i want to do with it i must listen to my life telling me who i am

the world is  days as for yesterday it has vanished along with all that was in it as for tomorrow you may never see it as for today it is yours so work on it

you will receive everything you need when you stop asking for what you do not need

as usual goodness hardly puts up a fight

change your life today dont gamble on the future act now without delay

you rely too much on brain the brain is the most overrated organ

in the short term it would make me happy to go play outside in the long term it would make me happier to do well at school and become successful but in the very long term i know which will make better memories

people who say that yesterday was better than today are ultimately devaluing their own existence

there are times in our lives when we have to realize our past is precisely what it is and we cannot change it but we can change the story we tell ourselves about it and by doing that we can change the future

but more than that he taught me something about good nature it is enough to be benign to be gentle to be funny to be kind

this is the strangest life i have ever known

love doesn’t have to be on valentine’s day it doesn’t have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirtythree or fiftynine it doesn’t have to conform to whatever is usual it doesn’t have to be kismet at once or rhapsody by the third day

it just has to be in time in place in spirt

it just has to be

the best stories dont come from good vs bad but good vs good

ive found that luck is quite predictable if you want more luck take more

chances be more active show up more often

if you cannot find peace within yourself you will never find it anywhere else

my hope still is to leave the world a bit better than when i got here

only after disaster can we be resurrected

we all make choices but in the end our choices make us

he shook his head just looking at me

what i asked

nothing he said

why are you looking at me like that

i kind of scoffed or sighed or exhaled in a way that was vaguely coughy and then said im not beau

you are like a millennial natalie portman like v for vendetta natalie portman

never seen it

really he asked pixiehaired gorgeous girl dislikes authority and cant help but fall for a boy she knows is trouble its your autobiography so far as i can tell

his every syllable flirted honestly he kind of turned me on i didnt even know that guys could turn me on  not like in real life

how easy it was to capitalize on a person’s own bent for selfdestruction how simple to nudge them into nonbeing then to stand back and shrug and agree that it had been the inevitable result of a chaotic catastrophic life

anyone who isnt embarrassed of who they were last year probably isnt learning enough

love yourself forgive yourself be true to yourself how you treat yourself sets the standard for how others will treat you

i’m sort of… coming off a bad relationship

when did it end

slightly before it started

those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it george santayana

ive got news for mr santayana were doomed to repeat the past no matter what thats what it is to be alive

in one drop of water are found all the secrets of all the oceans in one aspect of you are found all the aspects of existence

he found himself understanding the wearisomeness of this life where every path was an improvisation and a considerable part of ones waking life was spent watching ones feet

all those who try to unveil the mysteries always have tragic lives at the end they are always punished

life is at its best when everything has fallen out of place and you decide that youre going to fight to get them right not when everything is going your way and everyone is praising you

one of the tragic things i know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living we are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon  instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today

how much sweeter life would be if it all happened in reverse if after decades of disappointments you finally arrived at an age when you had conceded nothing when everything was possible

books can truly change our lives the lives of those who read them the lives of those who write them readers and writers alike discover things they never knew about the world and about themselves

the world is moving so fast these days that the man who says it cant be done is generally interrupted by someone doing it

tried living in the real world instead of a shell but i was bored before i even began

come clean with a child heart

laugh as peaches in the summer wind

let rain on a house roof be a song

let the writing on your face

be a smell of apple orchards on late june

everything you want in life is a relationship away

each day is born with a sunrise

and ends in a sunset the same way we

open our eyes to see the light

and close them to hear the dark

you have no control over

how your story begins or ends

but by now you should know that

all things have an ending

every spark returns to darkness

every sound returns to silence

and every flower returns to sleep

with the earth

the journey of the sun

and moon is predictable

but yours

is your ultimate

create your own miracles do what you think you cannot do

and all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees

and changing leaves

people are the most difficult thing in the world to change

in wisdom gathered over time i have found that every experience is a form of exploration

dont forget a persons greatest emotional need is to feel appreciated

and you drink a little too much and try a little too hard and you go home to a cold bed and think that was fine and your life is a long line of fine

all paths are present always and we can but choose among them

there are several ways to react to being lost one is to panic this was usually valentinas first impulse another is to abandon yourself to lostness to allow the fact that youve misplaced yourself to change the way you experience the world

whatever happens to your body your soul will survive untouched

she supposed they were imperfections those marks but they didnt feel that way to her they were a history cut into his body the map of a life of endless war

the life you have left is a gift cherish it enjoy it now to the fullest do what matters now

life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship

muscles aching to work minds aching to create  this is man

those who have failed to work toward the truth have missed the purpose of living

if you fuel your journey on the opinions of others you are going to run out of gas

whatever you believe with feeling becomes your reality

rule your mind or it will rule you

he was unheeded happy and near to the wild heart of life he was alone and young and wilful and wildhearted alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey sunlight

what it means to be authentic

to be more concerned with truth than opinions

to be sincere and not pretend

to be free from hypocrisy walk your talk

to know who you are and to be that person

to not fear others seeing your vulnerabilities

being confident to walk away from situations where you cant be yourself

being awake to your own feelings

being free from others opinions of you

accepting and loving yourself

sometimes letting go is simply changing the labels you place on an event looking at the same event with fresh eyes

there isnt enough of anything

as long as we live but at intervals

a sweetness appears and given a chance

i want you i want you so badly i can’t stand it when you left it felt like the world got darker like i couldn’t truly see anything couldn’t feel anything

i met a boy whose eyes showed me that the past present and future were all the same thing

as you grow up always tell the truth do no harm to others and dont think you are the most important being on earth rich or poor you then can look anyone in the eye and say im probably no better than you but im certainly your equal

and its fun when life is just flatout boring

keep your mind open the meaning of things lies in how people perceive them the same thing could mean different meanings to the same people at different times

you cant have living without dying so you cant call it living what we got we just are we just be like rocks beside the road

i will continue my path but i will keep a memory always

life is a succesion of lessons which must be lived to be understood

what a waste my life would be without all the beautiful mistakes ive made

what kind of life can you have in a house without books

try patting them on the back or shoulder and telling them everything is going to be fine lots of times when girls cry they dont want you to fix the problem they just want to be consoled

it frightens me the awful truth of how sweet life can be

ive been embarrassing myself since about birth

you see i kept asking myself then why am i so stupid that if others are stupid—and i know they are—yet i wont be wiser

if you havent confidence in self you are twice defeated in the race of life with confidence you have won even before you have started

no human should mislead another by promising them something they know to be untrue

it was when i stopped searching for home within others and lifted the foundations of home within myself i found there were no roots more intimate than those between a mind and body that have decided to be whole

the cradle rocks above an abyss and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness

i dont know how i look but i know how i feel young goofy infinite

life swings like a pendulum backward and forward between pain and boredom

each new day is a blank page in the diary of your life the secret of success is in turning that diary into the best story you possibly can

that is the hardest thing of all it is much harder to judge yourself than to judge others if you succeed in judging yourself its because youre truly a wise man

i always knew on some level that i wouldnt live long its simply not written in my stars

the heart makes its choices without weighing the consequences it doesnt look ahead to the lonely nights that follow

thats how it is on this bitch of an earth

the future is meant for those who are willing to let go of the worst parts of the past when you cannot take two steps without turning around to inspect your footsteps you are getting nowhere fast

life is the farce we are all forced to endure

atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what they were interested in not about what you were interested in

dont leave it all unsaid

somewhere in the wasteland of your head

some people insist that mediocre is better than best they delight in clipping wings because they themselves cant fly they despise brains because they have none

life is life you choose to live it or you do not

the friends you make in college are friends youll have for life even if you dont talk for years at a time

the worst thing he told me

is bitterness people end up so

in the haunted house of life art is the only stair that doesnt creak

never stop smiling not even when youre sad someone might fall in love with your smile

i knew that in the silence that followed that anything could happen here it might be too late again i might have missed my chance but i would at least know i tried that i took my heart and extended my hand whatever the outcome

i began to understand that suffering and disappointments and melancholy are there not to vex us or cheapen us or deprive us of our dignity but to mature and transfigure us

life is a winking light in the darkness

to succeed in life you need three things a wishbone a backbone and a funnybone

it’s always about timing if it’s too soon no one understands if it’s too late everyone’s forgotten

dead people can be our heroes because they cant disappoint us later they only improve over time as we forget more and more about them

its paradoxical that the idea of living a long life appeals to everyone but the idea of getting old doesnt appeal to anyone

isnt it strange that i know youd risk your life to save mine but i dont even know what your favorite color is

quietly endure silently suffer and patiently wait

in my many years i have come to a conclusion that one useless man is a shame two is a law firm and three or more is a congress

what made me run away was doubtless not so much the fear of settling down but of settling down permanently in something ugly

listen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth — look at the dying man’s struggle at his last extremity and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment

look everyone talks about the unknown like its some big scary thing but its the familiar thats always bothered me its heavy builds up around you like rocks until its walls and a ceiling and a cell

i feel no need for any other faith than my faith in the kindness of human beings i am so absorbed in the wonder of earth and the life upon it that i cannot think of heaven and angels

well i can understand how you feel you worked hard studying for the spelling bee and i suppose you feel you let everyone down and you made a fool of yourself and everything but did you notice something charlie brown

whats that

the world didnt come to an end

so shut up live travel adventure bless and dont be sorry

the trick  is to find the balance between the bright colors of humor and the serious issues of identity selfloathing and the possibility for intimacy and love when it seems no longer possible or sadder yet no longer necessary

life is fragile and temporary the faces of today quickly become the faces of the past sorrow pain and anger it all fades

except love love is forever and there after even when weve fallen to our graves

hurt is a part of life to be honest i think hurt is a part of happiness that our definition of happiness has gotten very narrow lately very nervous a little afraid of this brawling fabulous unpredictable world

people will always have opinions about your decision because theyre not courageous enough to take action on their opinion

the past can not be cured

per aspera ad astra papa i whispered through hardship to the stars

the best way to prepare for life is to begin to live

fuck it thats really the attitude that keeps a family together its not we love each other its just fuck it man

life is such a glorious trauma is it not

everyone thinks that courage is about facing death without flinching but almost anyone can do that almost anyone can hold their breath and not scream for as long as it takes to die

true courage is about facing life without flinching i dont mean the times when the right path is hard but glorious at the end im talking about enduring the boredom the messiness and the inconvenience of doing what is right

suspect each moment for it is a thief tiptoeing away with more than it brings

that woman doesnt have the sense god gave a retarded flea

its much easier to not know things sometimes things change and friends leave and life doesnt stop for anybody

life did not stop and one had to live

your entire sense of selfworth is predicated upon your belief that you matter that you matter to the universe but you dont because we are the ants

im always happy when im surrounded by water i think im a mermaid or i was a mermaid

the ocean makes me feel really small and it makes me put my whole life into perspective… it humbles you and makes you feel almost like you’ve been baptized i feel born again when i get out of the ocean

the world is wide and i will not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum

well sometimes i worry that my whole life will be based about whats comfortable and easy ill care too much about what makes me feel good to ever really reach for anything and then i worry that even if i do i wont succeed

i want to drag knives over my skin just to feel something other than shame but im not even brave enough for that

not forever does the bulbul sing

not forever lasts the spring

nor ever blossom the flowers

not forever reigneth joy

sets the sun on days of bliss

friendships not forever last

they know not life who know not this

but what is life if you dont live it

my formula for life is very simple in the morning wake up at night go to sleep in between i try and occupy myself as best i can

the life of the enemy  whoever lives for the sake of combating an enemy has an interest in the enemys staying alive

when nothing is sure everything is possible

whoever said that the past isnt dead had it backward its the future thats already dead already played out

the world’s greatest achievers have been those who have always stayed focussed on their goals and have been consistent in their efforts

if you want to be a new man you have to stay in new places and do new things with people who never knew you before if you go back to the same old ways what else can you be but the same old person

every time i thought i was being rejected from something good i was actually being redirected to something better

i always thought that life was about standing your ground no matter how strong the current was but going with the flow isnt so bad after all as long as it takes you forward

dogs are great bad dogs if you can really call them that are perhaps the greatest of them all

youll forget it when youre dead and so will i when im dead im going to forget everything–and i advise you to do the same

i’m not a bad person i haven’t killed anyone i rarely lie i don’t kick little puppies so why do people look at me as if the world would be a better place without me

life is a moderately good play with a badly written third act

keep your friends close but your enemies closer

i need to stop fantasizing about running away to some other life and start figuring out the one i have

bring something incomprehensible into the world

like madness is the glory of this life

i loved you long before you loved me its the only thing i have you beat at and ill bring it up every chance i get

what i am telling you before you begin my story is this  two things i crave truth and i lie

spend the afternoon you cant take it with you

it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can stop him from lynching me and i think thats pretty important

you cant do anything about the length of your life but you can do something about its width and depth

oh something is there waiting for me perhaps someday the revelation will burst in upon me and i will see the other side of this monumental grotesque joke and then ill laugh and then ill know what life is

the river is everywhere

life is no brief candle to me it is a sort of splendid torch which i have got a hold of for the moment and i want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations

your days are numbered use them to throw open the windows of your soul to the sun if you do not the sun will soon set and you with it

slow down and enjoy life its not only the scenery you miss by going too fast  you also miss the sense of where you are going and why

never give up on what you really want to do the person with big dreams is more powerful than one with all the facts

it is a joy to be hidden and disaster not to be found

there are no classes in life for beginners right away you are always asked to deal with what is most difficult

but i always liked sidepaths little dark backalleys behind the main road there one finds adventures and surprises and precious metal in the dirt

some people are born with tornadoes in their lives but constellations in their eyes other people are born with stars at their feet but their souls are lost at sea

it is said that power corrupts but actually its more true that power attracts the corruptible the sane are usually attracted by other things than power

tomorrow belongs to those who can hear it coming

sometimes its better to stop trying to make sense of things life isnt clear cut there are always gray areas

i said somebody should do something about that then i realized i am somebody

your hand can seize today but not tomorrow and thoughts of your tomorrow are nothing but desire don’t waste this breath if your heart isn’t crazy since the rest of your life won’t last forever

were not words henry were people

words are how others define us but we can define ourselves any way we choose

or rather let us be more simple and less vain

every last minute of my life has been preordained and im sick and tired of it

how this feels is im just another task in gods daily planner the italian renaissance penciled in for right after the dark ages

through all of living have much joy and laughter life is to be enjoyed not just endured

every man should lose a battle in his youth so he does not lose a war when he is old

the way is not in the sky the way is in the heart

you must learn to forgive a man when hes in love hes always a nuisance

in life there are no mistakes only lessons

you must learn to know the difference between tales and the truth my liza she would say fairy tales have a habit of ending too soon they never show what happens afterwards when the prince and princess ride off the page

the demon that you can swallow gives you its power and the greater life’s pain the greater life’s reply

it is a very natural human trait to destroy that which frightens us

we cannot after all judge a biography by its length by the number of pages in it we must judge by the richness of the contentssometimes the unfinisheds are among the most beautiful symphonies

in heaven an angel is no one in particular

a very wise man once told me that you cant look backyou just have to put the past behind you and find something better in your future

given that we can live only a small part of what there is in us  what happens with the rest

above all i have been a sentient being a thinking animal on this beautiful planet and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure

are those real islands asked the young prince

of course they are real islands said the man in evening dress

and those strange and troubling creatures

they are all genuine and authentic princesses

then god must exist cried the prince

i am god replied the man in full evening dress with a bow

the young prince returned home as quickly as he could

so you are back said the father the king

i have seen islands i have seen princesses i have seen god said the prince reproachfully

the king was unmoved

neither real islands nor real princesses i have seen god said the prince reproachfully

the king was unmoved

neither real islands nor real princesses nor a real god exist

i saw them

tell me how god was dressed

were the sleeves of his coat rolled back

the prince remembered that they had been the king smiled

that is the uniform of a magician you have been deceived

at this the prince returned to the next land and went to the same shore where once again he came upon the man in full evening dress

my father the king has told me who you are said the young prince indignantly you deceived me last time but not again now i know that those are not real islands and real princesses because you are a magician

the man on the shore smiled

it is you who are deceived my boy in your fathers kingdom there are many islands and many princesses but you are under your fathers spell so you cannot see them

the prince pensively returned home when he saw his father he looked him in the eyes

father is it true that you are not a real king but only a magician

the king smiled and rolled back his sleeves

yes my son i am only a magician

then the man on the shore was god

the man on the shore was another magician

i must know the real truth the truth beyond magic

there is no truth beyond magic said the king

the prince was full of sadness

he said i will kill myself

the king by magic caused death to appear death stood in the door and beckoned to the prince the prince shuddered he remembered the beautiful but unreal islands and the unreal but beautiful princesses

very well he said i can bear it

you see my son said the king you too now begin to be a magician

to be alive is to be missing

everything is funnier in retrospect funnier and prettier and cooler you can laugh at anything from far enough away

i once had a dreams of becoming a beautiful poet but upon an unfortunate series of events some of those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky that i wished on over and over again sparkling and broken

but i didnt really mind because i knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is

youre always with yourself so you might as well enjoy the company

ten long trips around the sun since i last saw that smile but only joy and thankfulness that on a tiny world in the vastness for a couple of moments in the immensity of time we were one

they both listened silently to the water which to them was not just water but the voice of life the voice of being the voice of perpetual becoming

i never could bear the idea of anyones expecting something from me it

always made me want to do just the opposite

dreams are hopeful because they exist as pure possibility unlike memories which are fossils long dead and buried deep

your heart’s strength is measured by how hard it holds on your self worth and faith is measured by finally letting go however your peace is measured by how long you don’t look back

if one has no sense of humor one is in trouble

no matter what your history has been your destiny is what you create today what are you going to create

and you know theres less charm in life when you think about deathbut its more peaceful

the spirit of a man is constructed out of his choices

the life of every individual viewed as a whole and in general and when only its most significant features are emphasized is really a tragedy but gone through in detail it has the character of a comedy

youd think what if i make a mistake today ill regret it i don’t believe in regret i feel everything leads us to where we are and we have to just jump forward mean well commit and just see what happens

the true miracle lies in our eagerness to allow appreciate and honor the uniqueness and freedom of each sentient being to sing the song of their heart

grace is what picks me up and lifts my wings high above and i fly grace always conquers be graceful in everything in anger in sadness in joy in kindness in unkindness retain grace with you

not in his speech not in his thoughts i see his greatness only in his actions in his life

but instead of spending our lives running towards our dreams we are often running away from a fear of failure or a fear of criticism

people see stories everywherewe take random events and we put them together in a pattern so we can comfort ourselves with a story no matter how much it obviously isnt truewe have to lie to ourselves to live otherwise wed go crazy

people soon get tired of things that arent boring but not of what is boring

regrets are about decisions that you know you should have done different

for what its worth i think happiness is a fleeting condition not a permanent state of goddamn mind ive learned that if you chase after moments of bliss here and there sometimes those moments will sustain you through the shit

if you are not the hero of your own story then youre missing the whole point of your humanity

memory can make a thing seem to have been much more than it was

everybodys damaged by something

for those who believe no proof is necessary for those who dont believe no proof is possible

my life has been one great big joke

a dance thats walked

a song thats spoke

i laugh so hard i almost choke

when i think about myself

if youre afraid of everyone leaving you what do you do

make them stay

and if you cant do that or dont know how to

ellie shrugged i dont know

yes you do in fact youve done it you leave first coop said so you dont have to watch them walk away

when i look at my old pictures all i can see is what i used to be but am no longer i think what i can see is what i am not

a lot of the conflict you have in your life exists simply because youre not living in alignment youre not be being true to yourself

all our knowledge has its origin in our perceptions

its not always easy being her daughter

i think she said sometimes its hard no matter whose daughter you are

its funny no matter how hard you try you cant close your heart forever and the minute you open it up you never know whats going to come in but when it does you just have to go for it because if you dont theres not point in being here

everyone is lonely we have to remember that life is to be lived one day at a time you cannot worry about the past or future happiness is in the now

every single time you help somebody stand up you are helping humanity rise

find ecstasy in life the mere sense of living is joy enough

how would your life be different if…you stopped validating your victim mentality let today be the day…you shake off your selfdefeating drama and embrace your innate ability to recover and achieve

i know im not going to be in your head all the time but once you know me ill be forever in your heart

a wind that blows aimlessly is no good to anyone

i had a dream about you last night the champagne was nonalcoholic you didnt notice and laughed at my jokes anyway

crying does not indicate that you are weak since birth it has always been a sign that you are alive

you couldnt erase everything that caused you pain with recollectionevery memory was valuable even the bad ones

i just want to do something that matters or be something that matters i just want to matter

even a snail will eventually reach its destination

the others in the dorm thought i wanted to be a writer because i was always alone with a book but i had no such ambition there was nothing i wanted to be

you will have to make up for the smallness of your size by your courage and selfless devotion to duty for it is not life that matters but the courage fortitude and determination you bring to it

leaders are limited by their vision rather than by their abilities

lifes pain you just have to get over as much of it as you can

life is ours to be spent not to

be saved

because there was a hunger in me to see everything and do everything i wanted to be everyone i saw i wasnt enough for me can you understand that

in a womans womb

to make the world better

many people pray to be kept out of unexpected problems

some people pray to be able to confront and overcome them

it’s not so much the journey that’s important as is the way that we treat those we encounter and those around us along the way

what keeps life fascinating is the constant creativity of the soul

leonard asks me if theres anything i need to know before he dies i think about it for a minute turn to him say whats the meaning of life leonard he laughs says thats an easy one my son its whatever you want it to be

there are two primary choices in life to accept conditions as they exist or accept the responsibility for changing them

a quitter never winsanda winner never quits

life sucks and then you die

yeah i should be so lucky

the ability to discipline yourself to delay gratification in the short term in order to enjoy greater rewards in the long term is the indispensable prerequisite for success

you are always a little bit wrong

live authentically why would you continue to compromise something thats beautiful to create something that is fake

when you are living the best version of yourself you inspire others to live the best versions of themselves

i am still in the land of the dying i shall be in the land of the living soon his last words

the shortness of life so often lamented may be the best thing about it

everything has boundaries the same holds true with thought you shouldnt fear boundaries but you should not be afraid of destroying them thats what is most important if you want to be free respect for and exasperation with boundaries

me i want to bloody kick this moronic bloody world in the bloody teeth over and over till it bloody understands that not hurting people is ten bloody thousand times more bloody important than being right

when was it i realized that on this truly dark and solitary path we all walk the only way we can light is our own although i was raised with love i was always lonely

someday without fail everyone will disappear scattered into the blackness of time

a celibate clergy is an especially good idea because it tends to suppress any hereditary propensity toward fanaticism

i cant seem to be a pessimist long enough to overlook the possibility of things being overwhelmingly good

it is your responsibility to find fault with me it is mine to hear you out but dont expect me to change

he asked where are you today right now

very well he said but you still have not answered my question about where you are

yes i did remember i told you how i got to where i am today by hard work

where are you

what do you mean where am i

where are you he repeated softly

im here

where is here

in this office in this gas station i was getting impatient with this game

where is this gas station

where is berkeley

where is california

in the united states

on a landmass one of the continents in the western hemisphere socrates i

where are the continents

i sighed on the earth are we done yet

where is the earth

in the solar system third planet from the sun the sun is a small star in the milky way galaxy all right

where is the milky way

oh brother  i sighed impatiently rolling my eyes in the universe i sat back and crossed my arms with finality

and where socrates smiled is the universe

the universe is well there are theories about how its shaped

thats not what i asked where is it

i dont know  how can i answer that

my ignorance is based on this understanding your understanding is based on ignorance this is why i am a humorous fool and you are a serious jackass

if you care about someone enough you’ll always be there for them no matter what

progress just means bad things happen faster

people in general would rather die than forgive its that hard

fame youll be famous as famous as can be with everyone watching you win on tv except when they dont because sometimes they wont

i feel like a big faker because ive been putting my life back together and nobody knows

each day is gods gift to you what you do with it is your gift to him

integrity is doing what is right and truthful and doing as you say you would do

scars show us where we have been they do not dictate where we are going

poor creatures what did we do to you with all our schemes and plans

why not just live in the moment especially if it has a good beat

life makes fools of all of us sooner or later but keep your sense of humor and youll at least be able to take your humiliations with some measure of grace in the end you know its our own expectations that crush us

never give up on anybody miracles happen everyday

i tried to contain myself but i escaped

no i regret nothing all i regret is having been born dying is such a long tiresome business i always found

you’re frustrated because you keep waiting for the blooming of flowers of which you have yet to sow the seeds

life is half delicious yogurt half crap and your job is to keep the plastic spoon in the yogurt

i think when you become a parent you go from being a star in the movie of your own life to the supporting player in the movie of someone elses

one day you will be the one called master naruto youll be the one to treat others to ramen we cant stay kids forever

water and air the two essential fluids on which all life depends have become global garbage cans

become the leader of your life lead yourself to where you want to be breathe life back into your ambitions your desires your goals your relationships

we are on strike we the men of the mind

life has become the future every moment of your life is lived for the future

until we can receive with an open heart we are never really giving with an open heart

i saw a star i reached for it i missed so i accepted the sky

life is much simpler if you don’t notice anything

life is grace sleep is forgiveness the night absolves darkness wipes the slate clean not spotless to be sure but clean enough for another days chalking

stop asking god to bless what youre doing find out what gods doing its already blessed

life always begins with one step outside of your comfort zone

being born is like being kidnapped and then sold into slavery

that i shall love always

that love is life

and life hath immortality

the reason why the universe is eternal is that it does not live for itself it gives life to others as it transforms

what had human beings become did war make us evil or just activate an evil already lurking within us

know who you are and be it know what you want and go out and get it

there is one who remembers the way to your door life you may evade but death you shall not

wildflower pick up your pretty little head

it will get easier your dreams are not dead

strange what being forced to slow down could do to a person

im as cruel as life as cruel as love

people are not lazy they simply have impotent goalsthat isgoals that do not inspire them

the main facts in human life are five birth food sleep love and death

always choose the future over the past what do we do now

slowly with many lost days i come back to life

you can play it safe and i wouldnt blame you for it you can continue as youve been doing and youll survive but is that what you want is that enough

i never approve or disapprove of anything now it is an absurd attitude to take towards life

life sucks then you die then it sucks again

youre only young once but you can be immature forever

in examining disease we gain wisdom about anatomy and physiology and biology in examining the person with disease we gain wisdom about life

the joy in life is his who has the heart to demand it

a sailor chooses the wind that takes the ship from a safe port ah yes but once youre abroad as you have seen winds have a mind of their own be careful charlotte careful of the wind you choose

you should read something else

why would he have done that to him

i dont know she said

do you ever feel like job

she smiled a little twinkle in her eyes

but you havent lost your faith

no i knew she hadnt but i think i was losing mine

is it because you think you might get better

no she saidits because its the only thing i have left

it is not the strongest of the species that survives

not the most intelligent that survives

it is the one that is the most adaptable to change

anymore no ones mind is their own

do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes

look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much more valuable than they

who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life

therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own

im not sure if theres one right place im supposed to be he said but i know a couple of wrong places id give a second try in a heartbeat

war is not for winning masha sighed koschei reading the tracks of supply lines of pincer strategies over her shoulder it is for surviving

for someone like myself in whom the ability to trust others is so cracked and broken that i am wretchedly timid and am forever trying to read the expression on peoples faces

real life is messy inconsistent and its seldom when anything ever really gets resolved its taken me a long time to realize that

nobody is exempt from the trials of life but everyone can always find something positive in everything even in the worst of times

to live greatly we must develop the capacity to face trouble with courage disappointment with cheerfulness and triumph with humility

shock is a merciful condition it allows you to get through disaster with a necessary distance between you and your feelings

it is always better

to avenge dear ones than to indulge in mourning

for every one of us living in this world

means waiting for our end let whoever can

win glory before death when a warrior is gone

that will be his best and only bulwark

the mind is a wonderful servant but a terrible master

until death it is all life

because never in my life have i ever been picked when there was another alternative

thats most interesting but i was no more a mindreader then than today i

was weeping for an altogether different reason when i watched you dancing that day i saw something else i saw a new world coming rapidly more

scientific efficient yes more cures for the old sicknesses very good but a

harsh cruel world and i saw a little girl her eyes tightly closed holding to her breast the old kind world one that she knew in her heart could not

remain and she was holding it and pleading never to let her go that is what i saw it wasnt really you what you were doing i know that but i saw you and it broke my heart and ive never forgotten

i dont expect life to make sense he said after a few moments but it could certainly be pleasant if it would stop kicking us in the balls

a persons rightful due is to be treated as an object of love not as an object for use

like a running blaze on a plain like a flash of lightning in the clouds we live in the flicker

i can learn to live with guilt i dont care about being good

love is forever if it wasnt it wouldnt be love the world is beautiful if it wasnt it wouldnt be the world

we all give up great expectations along the way

sure it could get rough sometimes but life wasnt a hollywood movie shit happened you fought you screamed and somehow you worked like hell to get out the other side still intact

they say that not matter how old you become when you are with your siblings you revert back to childhood

you didnt just cheat on me you cheated on us you didnt just break my heart you broke our future

i have to live if i want to be remembered

dont be afraid of the shadows that only means theres a light nearby

all the stuff you can’t wait to get away from until it’s not there anymore and then you miss it like crazy

the level of success you achieve will be in direct proportion to the depth of your commitment

life is full of beauty notice it notice the bumble bee the small child and the smiling faces smell the rain and feel the wind live your life to the fullest potential and fight for your dreams

thats the problem with memories you can visit them but you cant live in them

vital lives are about action you cant feel warmth unless you create it cant feel delight until you play cant know serendipity unless you risk

its amazing how quickly nature consumes human places after we turn our backs on them life is a hungry thing

it always sound scarier when a hollerer talk soft

when life doesnt meet your expectations it was important to take it with grace

there are times i wish i were invisible which is silly since i do everything i can to stand out

the longer we live the more weight we carry in our hearts

hope is not a feeling of certainty that everything ends well hope is just a feeling that life and work have a meaning

no matter what happened yesterday it is insignificant when compared to what lies within the core of your being today

to become vegetarian is to step into the stream which leads to nirvana

if we dont change we dont grow if we dont grow we arent really living

i should have learned this she thought i wanted to learn fire and pain but i should have learned people

birthdays could be such a bummer when you were older than the country you lived in

timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty

it is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped

be curious about the world in which you live look things up chase down every reference go deeper than anybody elsethats how youll get ahead

after a long labored sigh i said she was really happy when i got there i’m pretty sure she was suicidal when i left

you do have that effect on people

one of the best ways to influence people is to make those around you feel important

i had a dream about you last night you were holding a pine cone and introducing him as gerald

it’s life you don’t figure it out you just climb up on the beast and ride

do not become someone else just because you are hurt be who you are  smile it may solve all problems you have got

i had forgotten how much light there is in the world till you gave it back to me

oh for the years i have not lived but only dreamed of living

it takes as much courage to have tried and failed as it does to have tried and succeded

something amazing happens when youre in love and dont give a damn about what day it is anymore

you cant regret the life you didnt lead

if you dont know what you want youll never find it

if you dont know what you deserve youll always settle for less

you will wander aimlessly uncomfortably numb in your comfort zone wondering how life has ended up here

life starts now live love laugh and let your light shine

every path is the right path everything couldve been anything else﻿ and it would have just as much meaning

theres two kinds of womenthose you write poems about and those you dont

decide what you want to be

pay the price

and be what you want to be

love changes things hope allows us to endure until the change arrives

people say i make strange choices but they’re not strange for me my sickness is that i’m fascinated by human behavior by what’s underneath the surface by the worlds inside people

you just have to go after what you want and if it doesnt want you back then so be it it doesnt deserve you anyways

life was not longer something to endure but to live

there are two ways to live a life either forget everything or remember nothing

here was peace she pulled in her horizon like a great fishnet pulled it from around the waist of the world and draped it over her shoulder so much of life in its meshes she called in her soul to come and see

the only certainty life contains is death

please give your

bodies and your

to

who

deserve them

there is

no way

the

you would bring

and

i wish you

and

out

but not

you

we feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered the problems of life have still not been touched at all

all good childrens stories are the same young creature breaks rules has incredible adventure then returns home with the knowledge that aforementioned rules are there for a reason

of course the actual message to the careful reader is break rules as often as you can because who the hell doesnt want to have an adventure

this new day has greeted us with no rules unconditional opportunity do not dilute the power of this new day with the hardship of yesterday greet this day the way it has greeted you with open arms and endless possibility

holding a grudge  harboring angerresentment is poison to the soul get even with peoplebut not those who have hurt us forget them instead get even with those who have helped us

i will never deny that life isnt fair it seems as though when a woman leaves a man she is strong and independent but when a man leaves a woman he is a pig and a jerk

if you think something is missing in your life it is probably you

for one day there will be nothing left yet we will have something me

i tried to wait for my life to begin something has to happen like an amazing boy i know hes out there i just have to find him

the life so short the craft so long to learn

you have every right to a beautiful life

so i learned two things that night and the next day from him the perfection of a moment and the fleeting nature of it

thats not a bad wordhate and war are bad words but fuck isnt

dont let your luggage define your travels each life unravels differently

it is our wounds that create in us a desire to reach for miracles the fulfillment of such miracles depends on whether we let our wounds pull us down or lift us up towards our dreams

the ego relies on the familiar it is reluctant to experience the unknown which is they very essence of life

its such a stupid question in my opinion i mean how do you know what youre going to do till you do it the answer is you dont i think i am but how do i know i swear its a stupid question

you have to rely on whatever sparks you have inside

the difference between a nonsuicide and an exsuicide leaving the house for work at eight oclock on an ordinary morning

the nonsuicide is a little traveling suck of care sucking care with him from the past and being sucked toward care in the future his breath is high in his chest

the exsuicide opens his front door sits down on the steps and laughs since he has the option of being dead he has nothing to lose by being alive it is good to be alive he goes to work because he doesnt have to

by the truth we are undone life is a dream tis the waking that kills us he who robs us of our dreams robs us of our life

its faith in something and enthusiasm for something that makes a life worth living

rule of life if you bother to ask someone’s advice then bother to listen to it

isn’t it queer there are only two or three human stories and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they had never happened before like the larks in this country that have been singing the same five notes over for thousands of years

be in love with your life every detail of it

anything was better than nothing halffull was better than empty ignorance was the lowest form of humiliation and suffering

she who reconciles the illmatched threads

of her life and weaves them gratefully

into a single cloth –

it’s she who drives the loudmouths from the hall

and clears it for a different celebration

all life is only a set of pictures in the brain among which there is no difference betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreamings and no cause to value the one above the other

a little kid asks my dad why that man is chopping down the tree

and every day i thank god that i am alive not because i fear death but because my wife has a husband and my son is not an orphan

life goes on get over it youre still young itll get better blah blah blah

lifes not blackandwhite sometimes the ends justifies the means

so what is my story i dont know its long and twisted and not quite finished yet

may your life be filled as mine has been with love and laughter and remember when things are rough all you need is  chocolate

i am a fashion person and fashion is not only about clothes  its about all kinds of change

you dont win races by wishing you win them by running faster than everyone else does

so go out and live real good and i promise youll get beat up real bad but in a little while after youre dead youll be rotted away anyway its not gonna matter if you have a few scars it will matter if you didnt live

there is no thing as a singleissue struggle because we do not live singleissue lives

potential has a shelf life

there is nothing perfectonly life

we need people in our lives with whom we can be as open as possible to have real conversations with people may seem like such a simple obvious suggestion but it involves courage and risk

experience has shown and a true philosophy will always show that a vast perhaps the larger portion of truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant

i want an infinitely blank book and the rest of time

why didnt i learn to treat everything like it was the last time my greatest regret is how much i believed in the future

everything will be alright in the end so if it is not alright it is not the end

somewhere between love and hate lies confusion misunderstanding and desperate hope

you know people ask me they say dan three years later do you really want to be drawing cat whiskers on your face but they dont understand the cat whiskers they come from within

when writing there are some scenes that are emotionally overwhelming they completely overcome the author and only when they do this can they cause a similar reaction in the reader

through this the author gets to experience multiple lives if a characters life flashes before their eyes it flashes before the authors eyes too and he or she remembers it as his or her own

live your life be happy as you can be let go of the things that dont matter and fight

it takes no more time to see the good side of life than to see the bad

she looks at the swings and i can see she’s imagining what they’d look like if the kids weren’t there the guilt of this holds her down momentarily it appears to be there constantly never far away despite her love for them

i realize that nothing belongs to her anymore and she belongs to everything

life is a compromise of what your ego wants to do what experience tells you to do and what your nerves let you do

i know now after fifty years that the findinglosing forgettingremembering leavingreturning never stops the whole of life is about another chance and while we are alive till the very end there is always another chance

it is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique its not easy but if you accept your misfortune and handle it right your perceived failure can become a catalyst for profound reinvention

it is rare for people to be asked the question which puts them squarely in front of themselves

the dark unfathomd caves of ocean bear

full many a flower is born to blush unseen

and waste its sweetness on the desert air

try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of freewills involve and you find that you have excluded life itself

the ties that bind us to life are tougher than you imagine or than any one can who has not felt how roughly they may be pulled without breaking

i admire those who do good and expect nothing in return

no matter how many people give me advice i am going to do what my heart tells me to do

i always felt like you had to be important to have enemies

its okay we arent in the same class just dont forget that some of us watch the sunset too

happiness does not come from without it comes from within

womanhood stands for all that is pure and clean and noble she who does not make the world better for having lived in it has failed to be all that a woman should be

but all i could think of was how when nothing made sense and hadnt for ages you just have to grab onto anything you feel sure of

god put us here on this carnival ride we close our eyes never knowing where itll take us next

dreamers are mocked as impractical the truth is they are the most practical as their innovations lead to progress and a better way of life for all of us

paper is more patient than man

we just had a nearlife experience

and now i am here as alone as ive ever been i am seventeen years old this is not how its suppose to be this is not how my life is suppose to turn out

dont lose heart if its very difficult at times everything will come out all right and nobody can in the beginning do as he wishes

only when you accept that one day youll die can you let go and make the best out of life and thats the big secret thats the miracle

happiness is a state of mind a choice a way of living it is not something to be achieved it is something to be experienced

being faithful in the smallest things is the way to gain maintain and demonstrate the strength needed to accomplish something great

something that is yours forever is never precious

i just want someone to hear what i have to say and maybe if i talk long enough it’ll make sense

yesterday was a closed book tomorrow however was another story

anything that doesnt take years of your life and drive you to suicide hardly seems worth doing

the best way to waste your life is by taking notes the easiest way to avoid living is to just watch look for the details report dont participate

all evil is good become cancerous

i think choosing between men and women is like choosing between cake and ice cream youd be daft not to try both when there are so many different flavors

life is a waste of time and time is a waste of life so lets all get wasted and have the time of our lives

but in her life nothing was going to happen such was the will of god the future was a dark corridor and at the far end the door was bolted

without god life has no purpose and without purpose life has no meaning without meaning life has no significance or hope

our love was a twoperson game at least until one of us died and the other became a murderer

to pay attention this is our endless and proper work

i can chase you and i can catch you

but there is nothing i can do to make you mine

i am my own experiment i am my own work of art

he who robs us of our dreams robs us of our life

many things are not as they seem the worst things in life never are

its impossible to go through life unscathed nor should you want to by the hurts we accumulate we measure both our follies and our accomplishments

money is better than poverty if only for financial reasons

a life isnt measured in hours and minutes its the quality not the length

life starts out with everyone clapping when you take a poo and goes downhill from there

life is something that happens when you cant get to sleep

our life is made by the death of others

life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom

nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bullfighters

the more you believed in yourself the more you could trust yourself the more you trust yourself the less you compare yourself to others

life… for some it is battle for others its dancefor rich it is party for poor it is chance

no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace

so early its still almost dark out

im near the window with coffee

and the usual early morning stuff

that passes for thought

when i see the boy and his friend

walking up the road

to deliver the newspaper

they wear caps and sweaters

and one boy has a bag over his shoulder

they are so happy

they arent saying anything these boys

i think if they could they would take

each others arm

its early in the morning

and they are doing this thing together

they come on slowly

the sky is taking on light

though the moon still hangs pale over the water

such beauty that for a minute

death and ambition even love

doesnt enter into this

happiness it comes on

unexpectedly and goes beyond really

any early morning talk about it

the more you talk about them the more important they will feel the more you listen to them the more important you will make them feel

i failed to communicate thats why i chose to leave

all teachings are mere references the true experience is living your own life then even the holiest of words are only words

you will have five hundred million little bells and i shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water

when it rains it pours maybe the art of life is to convert tough times to great experiences we can choose to hate the rain or dance in it

its better to have a few faithful friends than numerous shallow friendships

what was the point of even having a conversation when words couldnt be trusted

i am so grateful for my troubles as i reflect back on my life i have come to realize that my greatest triumphs have been born of my greatest troubles

the things that stress me out havent changed

but i dont wanna lose anything

so i thought that at least i would change

im luckythat im afraid of losing something

but to believe that getting stuff is the purpose and aim of life is madness

oh god of dust and rainbows

help us to see

that without the dust the rainbow

would not be

her happiness floated like waves of ocean along the coast of her life she found lyrics of her life in his arms but she never sung her song

dont set your goals by what other people deem important

to be heroic is to be courageous enough to die for something to be inspirational is to be crazy enough to live a little

youre here to be light bringing out the godcolors in the world

matthew  the message

the people i distrust most are those who want to improve our lives but have only one course of action

i wouldnt have missed a single minute of it not for the whole world

atheism a religion dedicated to its own sense of smug superiority

be a true heart not a follower

take advantage of it now while you are young and suffer all you can because these things dont last your whole life

properly practiced knitting soothes the troubled spirit and it doesnt hurt the untroubled spirit either

isnt it sad how some peoples grip on their lives is so precarious that theyll embrace any preposterous delusion rather than face an occasional bleak truth

life is a perpetual yesterday for us

knowing it and seeing it are two different things

he stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields and hills to add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in his hair he spread his arm out wide i will go mad he annouced

virtue needs some cheaper thrills

poetry is a way of taking life by the throat

i cannot forecast to you the action of russia it is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma

sometimes you just have those days where everything goes wrong but sometimes and totally unexpectedly something can go right

coming forth into the light

i was born the day

what is

what was

and

what if

i was transformed the day

my ego shattered

and all the superficial material

things that mattered

to me before

to matter

i really came into being

the day i no longer cared about

what the world thought of me

only on my thoughts for

changing the world

remember your greatness

before you were born

and were still too tiny for

the human eye to see

you won the race for life

from among  million competitors

and yet

how fast you have forgotten

your strength

when your very existence

is proof of your greatness

you were born a winner

one who defied the odds

by surviving the most gruesome

battle of them all

and now that you are a giant

why do you even doubt victory

against smaller numbers

and wider margins

the only walls that exist

are those you have placed in your mind

and whatever obstacles you conceive

exist only because you have forgotten

what you have already

poetry by suzy kassem

the only true borders lie between day and night between life and death between hope and loss

real change is difficult at the beginning but gorgeous at the end change begins the moment you get the courage and step outside your comfort zone change begins at the end of your comfort zone

i had a dream about you i was sitting on your couch relating my succession of ideas on subconscious influence i asked you what they meant and you told me that free associations were a bad way to advance my political career

envy after all comes from wanting something that isnt yours but grief comes from losing something youve already had

every ounce of my cynicism is supported by historical precedent

hope is such a beautiful word but it often seems very fragile life is still being needlessly hurt and destroyed

in western lands beneath the sun

the flowers may rise in spring

the trees may bud the waters run

the merry finches sing

or there maybe tis cloudless night

and swaying branches bear

the elvenstars as jewels white

amid their branching hair

though here at journeys end i lie

beyond all towers strong and high

beyond all mountains steep

above all shadows rides the sun

and stars for ever dwell

i will not say the day is done

nor bid the stars farewellj

lottery a tax on people who are bad at math

the heart may freeze or it can burn the pain will ease and i can learn there is no future there is no past i live this moment as my last

you know my name not my story youve heard what ive done but not what ive been through

we started off trying to set up a small anarchist community but people wouldnt obey the rules

may all that have life be delivered from suffering

we fool ourselves so much we could do it for a living

the whole house seemed to exhale a melancholy breath of emptiness

if only you would realize some day how much have you hurt me

if only your heart ever craves for me or my presence…

if only you feel that love again someday for me

if only you are affected someday by my absence…

only you can end all my suffering and this unbearable pain

if only you would know what you could never procure…

if only you go through the memories of past once again

since the day you left my heart has bled no one has its cure…

if only you would bring that love those showers and that rain…

if only you would come back and see what damage you create

i’ve been waiting for your return since forever more…

if only you would see the woman that you have made

you said we cannot sail through how were you so sure

if only you can feel the old things that can never fade

you may have moved on but a piece of my heart is still with you…

i know how i’ve come so far alone i know how i’m able to wade

people say that i’m insane and you won’t ever come back again…

maybe you would have never made your separate way

maybe you would have stayed with me and proved everyone wrong…

if only you would know the pain of dying every day

if only you would feel the burden of smiling and being strong…

but what are loyalty and caring really worth

to me everything

the greatest wealth is health

sometimes it seemed to him that his life was delicate as a dandelion one little puff from any direction and it was blown to bits

remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose

we two boys together clinging

one the other never leaving

up and down the roads going north and south excursions making

armd and fearless eating drinking sleeping loving

no law less than ourselves owning sailing soldiering thieving

the turf or the seabeach dancing

fulfilling our foray

mens lives have meaning not their deaths

when humans were young they were pushed around in strollers when they were old they were pushed around in wheelchairs in between they were just pushed around

morning will come it has no choice

when was the last time you woke up and realized that today could be the best day of your life

after all if you run far enough no one can catch you

fleet kept running kaladin growled getting back under elhokar’s arm

what

he couldnt win but he kept running and when the storm caught him it didnt matter that he’d died because he’d run for all he had

sure all right the king sounded groggy though kaladin couldnt tell if it was the alcohol or the blood loss

we all die in the end you see kaladin said so i guess what truly matters is just how well youve run and elhokar youve kept running since your father was killed even if you screw up all the storming time

thank you the king said drowsy

those guys who want to have the mohawkwhich to me is the new business casual

the most important thing is this to be able at any moment to be free to choose a life that makes you happy

you live it forward but understand it backward

i wish i could say i felt guilty for what i did

i dont

but i have my life i’m living it it’s twisted exhausting uncertain and full of guilt but nonetheless there’s something there

you had to risk your life to get love you had to get right to the edge of death to ever be saved

the difference between school and life in school youre taught a lesson and then given a test in life youre given a test that teaches you a lesson

the life of every man is a diary in which he means to write one story and writes another and his humblest hour is when he compares the volume as it is with what he vowed to make it

i liked being a person i wanted to keep at it

i think of life as a good book the further you get into it the more it begins to make sense

kindness i’ve discovered is everything in life

it is part of the human nature always to judge others very severely andwhen the wind turns against usalways to find an excuse for our own misdeedsor to blame someone else for our mistakes

art and life are subjective not everybodys gonna dig what i dig but i reserve the right to dig it

if you dont get a goodnight kiss you get kafka dreams

one day can change your life one day can ruin your life all life is is three or four big days that change everything

when youre the most happening person at the party its time to leave

i think probably kindness is my number one attribute in a human being ill put it before any of the things like courage or bravery or generosity or anything else

brian sibley or brains even

oh gosh yes brains is one of the least you can be a lovely person without brains absolutely lovely kindness  that simple word to be kind  it covers everything to my mind

if youre kind thats it

if her enemies were brigans friends and her friends were brigans enemies then the two of them could walk through the world arm in arm and never be hit by arrows again

know what you want to do hold the thought firmly and do every day what should be done and every sunset will see you that much nearer the goal

i have given my word that only death will take me from you

i think that’s crap

i think a lot of people dream and while they are busy dreaming the really happy people the really successful people the really interesting powerful engaged people are busy doing

even though our time in this life is temporary if we live well enough our legacy will last forever

why can’t the world hear i ask myself within a few moments i ask it many times because it doesn’t care i finally answer and i know i’m right it’s like i’ve been chosen but chosen for what i ask

ill be happy if running and i can grow old together

one of the inescapable encumbrances of leading an interesting life is that there have to be moments when you almost lose it

our sweetest songs are those of saddest thought

letting go is the lesson letting go is always the lesson have you ever noticed how much of our agony is all tied up with craving and loss

sadly enough the most painful goodbyes are the ones that are left unsaid and never explained

oh sorry i was taking life seriously

it doesnt matter who you are or where you come from or how much money youve got in your pocket you have your own destiny and your own life ahead of you

dont give up its not over the universe is balanced every setback bears with it the seeds of a comeback

occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words their meanings can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart

the young always have the same problem  how to rebel and conform at the same time they have now solved this by defying their parents and copying one another

the world is merciless and its also very beautiful

i dont understand a thing about this world about people and why they do the things they do the more i find out the more i uncover the more i know the less i understand

because you can only die once but you can suffer forever

this world

that was our home

for a brief spell

but pain and grief

its a shame that not one of our problems

we depart

with a thousand regrets

in our hearts

a no does not hide anything but a yes very easily becomes a deception

nothing in this world compares to the comfort and security of having someone just hold your hand

whatever happens in your life no matter how troubling things might seem do not enter the neighbourhood of despair

even when all doors remain closed god wil open up a new path only for you be thankful it is easy to be thankful when all is well a sufi is thankful not only for what he has been given but also for all that has been denied

she laughed for her wasted difficult life that never had to be wasted or difficult in the first place

thats all you can do in this world no matter how strong the current beats against you or how heavy your burden or how tragic your love story you keep going

it seemed to me that this world has a serious shortage of both logic and kindness

you will be fine the fortune teller says there may be decisions to make and surprises in store life takes us to unexpected places sometimes the future is never set in stone remember that

excellenceperfection is not a destination it is a continuous journey that never ends

enjoy the little things for one day you may look back and realise they were the big things

man is the only animal that laughs and weeps for he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things are and what they ought to be

but life without meaning is the torture

of restlessness and vague desire

it is a boat longing for the sea and yet afraid

my biggest fault is that the faults i was born with grow bigger each year

nobody is so busy that they cant make time for the people they really care about

the rainy day

the day is cold and dark and dreary

it rains and the wind is never weary

the vine still clings to the mouldering wall

but at every gust the dead leaves fall

and the day is dark and dreary

my life is cold and dark and dreary

it rains and the wind is never weary

my thoughts still cling to the mouldering past

but the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast

and the days are dark and dreary

be still sad heart and cease repining

behind the clouds is the sun still shining

thy fate is the common fate of all

into each life some rain must fall

some days must be dark and dreary

i was not i was i am not i care not non fui fui non sum non curo

because sometimes things happen to people and theyre not equipped to deal with them

what looks like garbage from one angle might be art from another maybe it did take a crisis to get to know yourself maybe you needed to get whacked hard by life before you understood what you wanted out of it

life is a dance mindfulness is witnessing that dance

if my answers frighten you then you should cease asking scary questions

you know why love stories have happy endings i shake my head

because they end too early she continues they always end right at the kiss you never have to see all the bullshit that comes later you know life

your sister but beware of loving any other woman than your wifeand a wife was a woman who bore your childrenand once that happened to youyour life was forfeit to give them their daily bread

sometimes the course of our lives depends on what we do or dont do in a few seconds a heartbeat when we either seize the opportunity or just miss it miss the moment and you never get a chance again

accept yourself your strengths your weaknesses your truths and know what tools you have to fulfill your purpose

stop trying to be less of who you are let this time in your life cut you open and drain all of the things that are holding you back

what are you thinking he asks

his voice is soft why darlin

because it all led me here to you

i define nothing not beauty not patriotism i take each thing as it is without prior rules about what it should be

all i know is i make sense to me its other people who seem complicated

ive come to know that what we want in life is the greatest indication of who we really are

true life lies in laughter love and work

life is a train of moods like a string of beads and as we pass through them they prove to be many colored lenses which paint the world their own hue and each shows us only what lies in its own focus

i am not my body my body is nothing without me

at least one thing was consistent about her life it just kept on getting more complicated

the way you give your name to others is a measure of how much you like and

respect yourself

you are the grim goaloriented ones who will not believe that the joy is in the journey rather than the destination no matter how many times it has been proven to you

know that the same spark of life that is within you is within all of our animal friends the desire to live is the same within all of us

i’m talking about freedom fogg a sense of despair that becomes so great so crushing so catastrophic that you have no choice but to be liberated by it that’s the only choice or else you crawl into a corner and die

people with nothing to declare carry the most

never judge someones character based on the words of another instead study the motives behind the words of the person casting the bad judgment

it’s a strange myth that atheists have nothing to live for it’s the opposite we have nothing to die for we have everything to live for

life is painful and disappointing it is useless therefore to write new realistic novels we generally know where we stand in relation to reality and don’t care to know any more

make the choice to embrace this day do not let your today be stolen by the ghost of yesterday or the todo list of tomorrow it’s inspiring to see all the wonderfully amazing things that can happen in a day in which you participate

i’ve never once thought about how i was going to die she said i can’t think about it i don’t even know how i’m going to live

he knew sometimes some fear can be good when you are afraid things are going to get worse if you dont do something it can prompt you into action but it is not good when you are afraid that it keeps you from doing anything

those were strange days now that i look back at them in the midst of life everything revolved around death

i don’t know what it means to live

if you have a goal write it down if you do not write it down you do not have a goal  you have a wish

happiness is not the absence of problems its the ability to deal with them

you never really know whats coming a small wave or maybe a big one all you can really do is hope that when it comes you can surf over it instead of drown in its monstrosity

when we were kids

laying around the lawn

on our

we often talked

about

how

wed like to

and

we all

agreed on the

same

wed all

done any

and now

that

we are hardly

any longer

we think more

about

how

not to

and

were

most of

prefer to

do it

under the

now

that

most of

our lives

no one escapes from life alive

life itself is the proper binge

i don’t see myself being special i just see myself having more responsibilities than the next man people look to me to do things for them to have answers

stop giving your life away to other people

the soul is like an uninhabited world

that comes to life only when

god lays his head

against us

everything that had happened was shockingly beautiful enough to make you crazy

this is not the end this is not even the beginning of the end this is just perhaps the end of the beginning

i thought about the days i had handed over to a bottlethe nights i cant rememberthe mornings i slept thruall the time spent running from myself

be happy  if youre not even happy whats so good about surviving

my name is jimmy

but my friends just call me

the hideous penguin boy

if you say that you never lie in life

you honestly insult my intelligence

i understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss be it only for a brief moment in the contemplation of his beloved

you must purge yourself before finding faults in others

when you see a mistake in somebody else try to find if you are making the same mistake

this is the way to take judgment and to turn it into improvement

do not look at others bodies with envy or with superiority

all people are born with different constitutions

never compare with others

each ones capacities are a function of his or her internal strength

know your capacities and continually improve upon them

let us work without reasoning said martin it is the only way to make life endurable

there are two kinds of secrets the ones we keep from others and the ones we keep from ourselves

each book is a mind alive a life revealed a world awaiting exploration but living people are all those things as well—and more because their stories haven’t yet been completely told

sometimes i think there are only two instructions we need to follow to develop and deepen our spiritual life slow down and let go

so the hours are pretty good then he resumed

the vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the murky depths

yeah he said but now you come to mention it most of the actual minutes are pretty lousy

because no one needs to live for ever i think that sometimes you can outstay your welcome

most of us have the good or bad fortune of seeing our lives fall apart so slowly we barely notice

things dont always work out the way we hope you just have to pick yourself up and find a new direction to go in

to need of pity

or if compassion be freely

given out

take only enough

stop short of urge to plead

then purge away the need

than your own small heart

or greater than a star

with caress unmoved and cold

make of it a parka

for your soul

discover the reason why

so tiny human midget

exists at all

so scared unwise

but expect nothing live frugally

it’s a lack of clarity that creates chaos and frustration those emotions are poison to any living goal

people who fit don’t seek the seekers are those that don’t fit

i do not cling to life sufficiently to fear death

work harder on yourself than you do on your job

life is long and sometimes cruel sometimes victims are needed someone has to take on that role and human bodies are fragile easily damaged cut them and they bleed

some of the most beautiful things we have in life comes from our mistakes

i think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation

i could just remember how my father used to say that the reason for living was to get ready to stay dead a long time

middle age has been defined as what happens when a persons broad mind and narrow waist change places

simplify your life you dont grow spiritual you shrink spiritual

cant you ever be serious i said mortified

its difficult he said theres so little in life thats worth it

the world is a prison in which solitary confinement is preferable

life is just too much for me ive been confused right from the day i was born i think the whole trouble is that were thrown into life too fast were not really prepared

what did you want a chance to warm up first

the truth was history repeated itself on a daily basis mistakes were made over and over people were haunted by what they had done and by what they hadnt had time to do

i get it now i didnt get it then that life is about losing and about doing it as gracefully as possibleand enjoying everything in between

do you understand what im saying

shouted moist you cant just go around killing people

why not you do the golem lowered his arm

what snapped moist i do not who told you that

i worked it out you have killed two point three three eight people said the golem calmly

i have never laid a finger on anyone in my life mr pump i may be–– all the things you know i am but i am not a killer i have never so much as drawn a sword

later on in life you expect a bit of rest dont you you think you deserve it i did anyway but then you begin to understand that the reward of merit is not lifes business

our honeymoon will shine our life long its beams will only fade over your grave or mine

if you want something you dont wait for the world to deal it out for you you take it

but a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being nor can the dead ever be brought back to life

but certainly for us who understand life figures are a matter of indifference

love doesnt make the world go round love is what makes the ride worthwhile

having nothing to struggle

against

they have nothing to struggle

all successful people men and women are big dreamers they imagine what their future could be ideal in every respect and then they work every day toward their distant vision that goal or purpose

there is a very fine line between loving life and being greedy for it

life is boring people are vengeful good things always end we do so many things and we don’t know why and if we do find out why it’s decades later and knowing why doesn’t matter any more

this autumn

why am i growing old

the continuous narrative of existence is a lie there is no continuous narrative there are litup moments and the rest is dark

stop comparing yourself to others always strive to improve yourself to become better today than you were yesterday to serve those around you and the world

whenever i see an ambulance i like to think there is a baby being born rather than a death

because you have to just go with the flow your life is not your own with people coming in and out all the time you get mellow because you have to

the thing is you can’t always have the best of everything because for a life to be real you need it all good and bad beach and concrete the familiar and the unknown big talkers and small towns

everybody was sorry sorry was easy sorry was for suckers

at your weakest you end up showing more strength at your lowest you are suddenly lifted higher than you’ve ever been they all border one another these opposites and show how quickly we can be altered

i know im an acquired taste  im anchovies and not everybody wants those hairy little things

you know considering your iq youre really socially retarded sometimes

you cant blame these kids for not being thankful or satisfied with what they have their mentality eludes them from the reality

in books theres always somebody standing by ready to say hey the worlds in danger evils on the rise but if youre really quick and take this ring and put it in that volcano over there everything will be fine

mahoney thirtyseven seconds great well done now we wait

the doctor said gently

what im going to say

will sound pretty wild

but youre not the father

of this strange looking child

about the childs gender

but we think that its father

is a microwave blender

the hemulen woke up slowly and recognised himself and wished he had been someone he didnt know

a call to action had been born

love changes what is probable and makes unlikely things possible

would you like to know your future

if your answer is yes think again not knowing is the greatest life motivator

so enjoy endure survive each moment as it comes to you in its proper sequence  a surprise

i believe life is constantly testing us for our level of commitment and lifes

greatest rewards are reserved for those who demonstrate a neverending

commitment to act until they achieve this level of resolve can move mountains but it must be constant and consistent as simplistic as this may

sound it is still the common denominator separating those who live their

dreams from those who live in regret

each player must accept the cards life deals him or her but once they are in hand he or she alone must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game

there are only a few notes just variations on a theme

love those who hurt you the most because they are probably the ones closest to you

they too are on a path and just like you they are learning to walk before they can fly imagine of everybody you hurt in life turned their backs on you you would be playing a hell of a lot of solitaire

love them no matter what

i feel very adventurous there are so many doors to be opened and im not afraid to look behind them

even if no salvation should come i want to be worthy of it at every moment

every single desire can lead to dream and every single dream has possibility to become reality

in the year  the best men dont run for president they run for their lives

still he figured sometimes youve got to do what youve got to do and then sometimes youve just got to run like hell after its done

cake is happiness if you know the way of the cake you know the way of happiness if you have a cake in front of you you should not look any further for joy

music is enough for a lifetime but a lifetime is not enough for music

life is a slope as long as youre going up youre always looking towards the top and you feel happy but when you reach it suddenly you can see the road going downhill and death at the end of it all its slow going up and quick going down

you must decide if you are going to rob the world or bless it with the rich valuable potent untapped resources locked away within you

we may run walk stumble drive or fly but let us never lose sight of the reason for the journey or miss a chance to see a rainbow on the way

but there must be some pleasure in condemning everythingin perceiving faults where others think they see beauties

you mean there is pleasure in having no pleasure

heaven is an idea constructed by man to help him cope with the fact that life on earth is both brutally short and paradoxically far too long

it had always seemed to him a very plush kind of problem a privilege really to consider whether life was meaningful or not

someone once said that death is not the greatest loss in life the greatest loss is what dies inside of us while we live i could tell you who said it but who the hell really cares

read deeply stay open continue to wonder

you know whats truly weird about any financial crisis we made it up currency money finance theyre all social inventions when the sun comes up in the morning its shining on the same physical landscape all the atoms are in place

it’s hard to watch

the game we make of love

like everyone’s playing checkers

with their scars

whenever they get out

just to be clear

i don’t want to get out

i intend to leave this life

so shattered

there’s gonna have to be

for all of my flying parts

ignorance is the cause of fear

i hate when people say i see it doesnt mean anything and i think its hostile whenever anyone tells me i see i think theyre really saying fuck you

focus on making choices to lead your life that aligns with your core values in the most purposeful way possible

no matter how many people believe or don’t believe in you you must be

the ultimate believer in yourself

to build up a library is to create a life its never just a random collection of books

in the end things must be as they are and have always beenthe great things remain for the great the abysses for the profound the delicacies and thrills for the refined and to sum up shortly everything rare for the rare

im a fountain of blood in the shape of a girl

we must laugh and cry enjoy and suffer in a word vibrate to our full capacity … i think that’s what being really human means

regret is counterproductive its looking back on a past that you cant change questioning things as they occur can prevent regret in the future

i think people would live a bit longer if they didnt know how old they were age puts restrictions on things

mankind flung its advance agents ever outward ever outward eventually it flung them out into space into the colorless tasteless weightless sea of outwardness without end

it flung them like stones

what did you expect he asked himself

the past is a place of learning not a place of living

do i have an original thought in my head my bald head maybe if i were happier my hair wouldnt be falling out

life is short i need to make the most of it today is the first day of the rest of my life im a walking cliché

i should get my hair cut short stop trying to fool myself and everyone else into thinking i have a full head of hair how pathetic is that

just be real confident isnt that what women are attracted to men dont have to be attractive but thats not true especially these days almost as much pressure on men as there is on women these days

good morning said the little prince

good morning said the merchant

this was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst you need only swallow one pill a week and you would feel no need for anything to drink

why are you selling those asked the little prince

because they save a tremendous amount of time said the merchant computations have been made by experts with these pills you save fiftythree minutes in every week

and what do i do with those fiftythree minutes

anything you like

as for me said the little prince to himself if i had fiftythree minutes to spend as i liked i should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water

ive screwed everything up royally i remember you saying that growing up happens when you start having things you look back on and wish you could change

opportunity the more likely it is that you will achieve the security that you

therere things we keep hidden from one another things we hide from ourselves things that are kept hidden from us and things no one knows you always learn the damnedest things at the worst possible times

there are some places in life where you can only go alone embrace the beauty of your solo journey

that is life to begin again when everything is lost

life is but a memory happened long ago theatre full of sadness for a long forgotten show

some of us werent born for rewards froi we were born for sacrifices

war had bled color from everything leaving nothing but a storm of gray

remember that life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away

it strikes me profoundly that the world is more often than not a bad and cruel place

my father chose my name  and my last name was chosen by my ancestors  that’s enough i myself choose my way

dustfinger inspected his reddened fingers and felt the taut skin ‘he might tell me how my story ends’ he murmured

meggie looked at him in astonishment ‘you mean you don’t know’

dustfinger smiled meggie still didn’t particularly like his smile it seemed to appear only to hide something else ‘what’s so unusual about that princess’ he asked quietly ‘do you know how your story ends’

meggie had no answer for that

you can con god and get away with it granny said if you do so with charm and wit if you live your life with imagination and verve god will play along just to see what outrageously entertaining thing youll do next

nothing is more natural than mutual misunderstanding the contrary is always surprising i believe that one never agrees on anything except by mistake and that all harmony among human beings is the happy fruit of an error

no one survives life

the moment she was cursed i lost her once it wears off soon she will be embarrassed to remember things that she said things she did things like this no matter how solid she feels in my arms she is made of smoke

because people who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves theyd never admit in normal conversation its a way for people to be honest without telling the truth

im selfish impatient and a little insecure i make mistakes i am out of control and at times hard to handle but if you cant handle me at my worst then you sure as hell dont deserve me at my best

youve gotta dance like theres nobody watching

love like youll never be hurt

he has achieved success who has lived well laughed often and loved much

who has enjoyed the trust of pure women the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children

who has filled his niche and accomplished his task

who has never lacked appreciation of earths beauty or failed to express it

whether an improved poppy a perfect poem or a rescued soul

who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had

whose life was an inspiration

do i not destroy my enemies when i make them my friends

if you want to forget something or someone never hate it or never hate himher everything and everyone that you hate is engraved upon your heart if you want to let go of something if you want to forget you cannot hate

this is your life and its ending one moment at a time

take responsibility of your own happiness never put it in other people’s hands

dont take life too seriously punch it in the face when it needs a good hit laugh at it

it was not the feeling of completeness i so needed but the feeling of not being empty

dont you think its better to be extremely happy for a short while even if you lose it than to be just okay for your whole life

people say that life is the thing but i prefer reading

dwell on the beauty of life watch the stars and see yourself running with them

dont be afraid of death be afraid of an unlived life you dont have to live forever you just have to live

accept yourself love yourself and keep moving forward if you want to fly you have to give up what weighs you down

do what is right not what is easy nor what is popular

dont part with your illusions when they are gone you may still exist but you have ceased to live

to say goodbye is to die a little

live the life of your dreams be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others

you couldnt relive your life skipping the awful parts without losing what made it worthwhile you had to accept it as a wholelike the world or the person you loved

even death has a heart

life he realize was much like a song in the beginning there is mystery in the end there is confirmation but its in the middle where all the emotion resides to make the whole thing worthwhile

life shrinks or expands in proportion to ones courage

the past is a place of reference not a place of residence the past is a place of learning not a place of living

biology gives you a brain life turns it into a mind

im sure the universe is full of intelligent life its just been too intelligent to come here

ive got nothing to do today but smile

that it will never come again is what makes life so sweet

letting go means to come to the realization that some people are a part of your history but not a part of your destiny

books say she did this because life says she did this books are where things are explained to you life is where things arent im not surprised some people prefer books

believe in your heart

believe in your heart that youre meant to live a life full of passion purpose magic and miracles

if you ask me what i came to do in this world i an artist will answer you i am here to live out loud

suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be i have been bent and broken but  i hope  into a better shape

be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals

if you aren’t grateful for what you already have what makes you think you would be happy with more

you realize that our mistrust of the future makes it hard to give up the past

was it hard i ask

not as hard as holding on to something that wasnt real

a learning experience is one of those things that says you know that thing you just did dont do that

you will find that it is necessary to let things go simply for the reason that they are heavy so let them go let go of them i tie no weights to my ankles

maybe everyone can live beyond what theyre capable of

the past has no power over the present moment

make improvements not excuses seek respect not attention

life becomes easier and more beautiful when we can see the good in other people

follow your heart listen to your inner voice stop caring about what others think

dont waste your time with explanations people only hear what they want to hear

no one knows for certain how much impact they have on the lives of other people oftentimes we have no clue yet we push it just the same

once you had put the pieces back together even though you may look intact you were never quite the same as youd been before the fall

life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes dont resist them that only creates sorrow let reality be reality let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like

pursue what catches your heart not what catches your eyes

its all in the view thats what i mean about forever too for any one of us our forever could end in an hour or a hundred years from now you never know for sure so youd better make every second count

a random act of kindness no matter how small can make a tremendous impact on someone elses life

a good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving

you yourself as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection

to be or not to be that is the question

whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer

the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune

or to take arms against a sea of troubles

and by opposing end them to die to sleep

no more and by a sleep to say we end

the heartache and the thousand natural shocks

that flesh is heir to tis a consummation

devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep

to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub

for in that sleep of death what dreams may come

when we have shuffled off this mortal coil

must give us pause theres the respect

that makes calamity of so long life

for who would bear the whips and scorns of time

the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely

the pangs of despised love the laws delay

the insolence of office and the spurns

that patient merit of the unworthy takes

when he himself might his quietus make

with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear

to grunt and sweat under a weary life

but that the dread of something after death

the undiscoverd country from whose bourn

no traveller returns puzzles the will

and makes us rather bear those ills we have

than fly to others that we know not of

thus conscience does make cowards of us all

and thus the native hue of resolution

is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought

and enterprises of great pith and moment

with this regard their currents turn awry

and lose the name of actionsoft you now

the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons

be all my sins rememberd

we can never judge the lives of others because each person knows only their own pain and renunciation its one thing to feel that you are on the right path but its another to think that yours is the only path

don’t waste your time in anger regrets worries and grudges life is too short to be unhappy

the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man

life is about accepting the challenges along the way choosing to keep moving forward and savoring the journey

believe in yourself you are braver than you think more talented than you know and capable of more than you imagine

learn to light a candle in the darkest moments of someone’s life be the light that helps others see it is what gives life its deepest significance

a purpose of human life no matter who is controlling it is to love whoever is around to be loved

wisdom comes from experience experience is often a result of lack of wisdom

your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life keep going tough situations build strong people in the end

you endure what is unbearable and you bear it that is all

no amount of regretting can change the past and no amount of worrying can change the future

the saddest people ive ever met in life are the ones who dont care deeply about anything at all passion and satisfaction go hand in hand and without them any happiness is only temporary because theres nothing to make it last

don’t try to make life a mathematics problem with yourself in the center and everything coming out equal when you’re good bad things can still happen and if you’re bad you can still be lucky

no persons are more frequently wrong than those who will not admit they are wrong

when you find your path you must not be afraid you need to have sufficient courage to make mistakes disappointment defeat and despair are the tools god uses to show us the way

if people refuse to look at you in a new light and they can only see you for what you were only see you for the mistakes youve made if they dont realize that you are not your mistakes then they have to go

you can have it all just not all at once

if you end up with a boring miserable life because you listened to your mom your dad your teacher your priest or some guy on television telling you how to do your shit then you deserve it

one of the advantages of being disorganized is that one is always having surprising discoveries

the purpose of life is to live it to taste experience to the utmost to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience

the more you know who you are and what you want the less you let things upset you

whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever they always list depression among the side effects of cancer but in fact depression is not a side effect of cancer depression is a side effect of dying

appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak

i meant said ipslore bitterly what is there in this world that truly makes living worthwhile

death thought about it

cats he said eventually cats are nice

it does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop

remember remember this is now and now and now live it feel it cling to it i want to become acutely aware of all i’ve taken for granted

do not fall in love with people like me

i will take you to museums and parks and monuments and kiss you in every beautiful place so that you can never go back to them without tasting me like blood in your mouth

i will destroy you in the most beautiful way possible and when i leave you will finally understand why storms are named after people

start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart

cry forgive learn move on let your tears water the seeds of your future happiness

all parents damage their children it cannot be helped youth like pristine glass absorbs the prints of its handlers some parents smudge others crack a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces beyond repair

there is only one sin and that is theft when you tell a lie you steal someones right to the truth

i like flaws i think they make things interesting

success is not how high you have climbed but how you make a positive difference to the world

friendship marks a life even more deeply than love love risks degenerating into obsession friendship is never anything but sharing

treat everyone with politeness and kindness not because they are nice but because you are

the trouble is if you don’t spend your life yourself other people spend it for you

be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone

do not fear failure but rather fear not trying

you cannot control the behavior of others but you can always choose how you respond to it

life is not a matter of holding good cards but of playing a poor hand well

time was passing like a hand waving from a train i wanted to be on

i hope you never have to think about anything as much as i think about you

i dont like people who have never fallen or stumbled their virtue is lifeless and it isnt of much value life hasnt revealed its beauty to them

dont just take give

dont just see feel

don’t just dream do

dont just hear listen

dont just exist live

please believe that things are good with me and even when theyre not they will be soon enough and i will always believe the same about you

never be bullied into silence never allow yourself to be made a victim accept no ones definition of your life but define yourself

to choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation

if the real world were a book it would never find a publisher overlong detailed to the point of distractionand ultimately without a major resolution

how nice  to feel nothing and still get full credit for being alive

there are two means of refuge from the misery of life — music and cats

always find opportunities to make someone smile and to offer random acts of kindness in everyday life

theres nowhere you can be that isnt where youre meant to be

if i had my life to live over again i would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week

they say im oldfashioned and live in the past but sometimes i think progress progresses too fast

better to die fighting for freedom then be a prisoner all the days of your life

if you know someone who’s depressed please resolve never to ask them why depression isn’t a straightforward response to a bad situation depression just is like the weather

i could die for you but i couldnt and wouldnt live for you

im killing time while i wait for life to shower me with meaning and happiness

you never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone change begins at the end of your comfort zone

anxiety is the dizziness of freedom

never lose hope storms make people stronger and never last forever

be thankful for what you have youll end up having more if you concentrate on what you dont have you will never ever have enough

do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future there are no limits to what you can achieve on your journey through life except in your mind

to shine your brightest light is to be who you truly are

i want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me

if then i were asked for the most important advice i could give that which i considered to be the most useful to the men of our century i should simply say in the name of god stop a moment cease your work look around you

to love life to love it even

when you have no stomach for it

and everything youve held dear

crumbles like burnt paper in your hands

your throat filled with the silt of it

when grief sits with you its tropical heat

thickening the air heavy as water

more fit for gills than lungs

when grief weights you like your own flesh

only more of it an obesity of grief

you think how can a body withstand this

then you hold life like a face

between your palms a plain face

no charming smile no violet eyes

and you say yes i will take you

i will love you again

be thankful for everything that happens in your life it’s all an experience

after

all this time

the sun never says to the earth

you owe me

what happens

with a love like that

it lights the whole sky

incredible change happens in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power over instead of craving control over what you dont

a man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life

life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all

time doesn’t heal emotional pain you need to learn how to let go

luxury is not a necessity to me but beautiful and good things are

you are not rich until you have a rich heart

when things break its not the actual breaking that prevents them from getting back together again its because a little piece gets lost  the two remaining ends couldnt fit together even if they wanted to the whole shape has changed

stop comparing yourself to other people just choose to be happy and live your own life

you get what anybody gets  you get a lifetime

death is so terribly final while life is full of possibilities

life doesnt imitate art it imitates bad television

maybe this world is another planet’s hell

the most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create to overcome to endure to transform to love and to be greater than our suffering

i sit beside the fire and think

of all that i have seen

of meadow flowers and butterflies

in summers that have been

of yellow leaves and gossamer

in autumns that there were

with morning mist and silver sun

and wind upon my hair

i sit beside the fire and think

of how the world will be

when winter comes without a spring

that i shall ever see

for still there are so many things

that i have never seen

there is a different green

i sit beside the fire and think

and people that will see a world

that i shall never know

but all the while i sit and think

of times there were before

and voices at the door

i have accepted fear as part of life – specifically the fear of change i have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says turn back

nothing in life is to be feared it is only to be understood now is the time to understand more so that we may fear less

it is not the length of life but the depth

he allowed himself to be swayed by his conviction that human beings are not born once and for all on the day their mothers give birth to them but that life obliges them over and over again to give birth to themselves

there is a saying in tibetan tragedy should be utilized as a source of strength

no matter what sort of difficulties how painful experience is if we lose our hope thats our real disaster

throw your dreams into space like a kite and you do not know what it will bring back a new life a new friend a new love a new country

sometimes it takes a good fall to really know where you stand

be steady and wellordered in your life so that you can be fierce and original in your work

do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul

laugh even when you feel too sick or too worn out or tired

smile even when youre trying not to cry and the tears are blurring your vision

sing even when people stare at you and tell you your voice is crappy

trust even when your heart begs you not to

twirl even when your mind makes no sense of what you see

frolick even when you are made fun of kiss even when others are watching sleep even when youre afraid of what the dreams might bring

run even when it feels like you cant run any more

your emotions are the slaves to your thoughts and you are the slave to your emotions

life has no remoteget up and change it yourself

the bhagavad gitathat ancient indian yogic textsays that it is better to live your own destiny imperfectly than to live an imitation of somebody elses life with perfection

sometimes you dont need a goal in life you dont need to know the big picture you just need to know what youre going to do next

sometimes i lie awake at night and i ask where have i gone wrong

then a voice says to me this is going to take more than one night

if a man will begin with certainties he shall end in doubts but if he will be content to begin with doubts he shall end in certainties

i believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong i believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls i believe that tomorrow is another day and i believe in miracles

i’ve known people that the world has thrown everything at to discourage themto break their spirit and yet something about them retains a dignity they face life and don’t ask quarters

ill try anything once twice if i like it three times to make sure

tiger got to hunt bird got to fly

man got to sit and wonder why why why

tiger got to sleep bird got to land

man got to tell himself he understand

what a strange thing

to be alive

life is to be lived not controlled and humanity is won by continuing to play in face of certain defeat

when you consider things like the stars our affairs dont seem to matter very much do they

it was only a sunny smile and little it cost in the giving but like morning light it scattered the night and made the day worth living

there are times to stay put and what you want will come to you and there are times to go out into the world and find such a thing for yourself

the secret of life is honesty and fair dealing if you can fake that youve got it made

my only advice is to stay aware listen carefully and yell for help if you need it

when i look in the mirror i know i’m looking at someone who isn’t sure she deserves to be loved at all

life has become immeasurably better since i have been forced to stop taking it seriously

sometimes the right thing feels all wrong until it is over and done with

what makes big boobs and perkiness so attractive to boys i mean really two round mounds of fat and a fake smile yeah winning attributes

i just need to know that someone out there listens and understands and doesnt try to sleep with someone even if they could have i need to know these people exist

life seems sometimes like nothing more than a series of losses from beginning to end thats the given how you respond to those losses what you make of whats left thats the part you have to make up as you go

after all tomorrow is another day

we are taught you must blame your father your sisters your brothers the school the teachers  but never blame yourself its never your fault but its always your fault because if you wanted to change youre the one who has got to change

the real things havent changed it is still best to be honest and truthful to make the most of what we have to be happy with simple pleasures and have courage when things go wrong

i felt once more how simple and frugal a thing is happiness a glass of wine a roast chestnut a wretched little brazier the sound of the sea nothing else

i live in my own little world but its ok they know me here

living is easy with eyes closed

i am incapable of conceiving infinity and yet i do not accept finity i want this adventure that is the context of my life to go on without end

life isnt fair its just fairer than death thats all

face your life its pain its pleasure leave no path untaken

the difference between fiction and reality fiction has to make sense

sometimes you have to lose all you have to find out who you truly are

let the improvement of yourself keep you so busy that you have no time to criticize others

do not set aside your happiness do not wait to be happy in the future the best time to be happy is always now

if you cant change your fate change your attitude

to acquire the habit of reading is to construct for yourself a refuge from almost all the miseries of life

the right thing and the easy thing are never the same

sometimes life knocks you on your ass get up get up get up happiness is not the absence of problems its the ability to deal with them

no sympathy for the devil keep that in mind buy the ticket take the rideand if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind wellmaybe chalk it up to forced consciousness expansion tune in freak out get beaten

dont be afraid to be confused try to remain permanently confused anything is possible stay open forever so open it hurts and then open up some more until the day you die world without end amen

no matter how long you train someone to be brave you never know if they are or not until something real happens

if you care about something you have to protect it – if you’re lucky enough to find a way of life you love you have to find the courage to live it

now and then its good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy

you live but once you might as well be amusing

death is not the opposite of life but a part of it

at the time my life just seemed too complete and maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves

we cannot change the cards we are dealt just how we play the hand

thats what people do who love you they put their arms around you and love you when youre not so lovable

id learned that some things are best kept secret

people make mistakes in life through believing too much but they have a damned dull time if they believe too little

so it’s true when all is said and done grief is the price we pay for love

there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it

i can choose either to be a victim of the world or an adventurer in search of treasure its all a question of how i view my life

unexpected intrusions of beauty this is what life is

whoever saves one life saves the world entire

why are trying so hard to fit in when youre born to stand out

sometimes you have to kind of die inside in order to rise from your own ashes and believe in yourself and love yourself to become a new person

help others without any reason and give without the expectation of receiving anything in return

despite your best efforts people are going to be hurt when its time for them to be hurt

there’s no such thing as ruining your life life’s a pretty resilient thing it turns out

how would your life be different if…you stopped making negative judgmental assumptions about people you encounter let today be the day…you look for the good in everyone you meet and respect their journey

do i dare

disturb the universe

in a minute there is time

for decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse

if you can keep your head when all about you

are losing theirs and blaming it on you

if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you

but make allowance for their doubting too

if you can wait and not be tired by waiting

or being lied about dont deal in lies

or being hated dont give way to hating

and yet dont look too good nor talk too wise

if you can dream  and not make dreams your master

if you can think  and not make thoughts your aim

if you can meet with triumph and disaster

and treat those two impostors just the same

if you can bear to hear the truth youve spoken

twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools

or watch the things you gave your life to broken

and stoop and build em up with wornout tools

if you can make one heap of all your winnings

and risk it on one turn of pitchandtoss

and lose and start again at your beginnings

and never breathe a word about your loss

if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

to serve your turn long after they are gone

and so hold on when there is nothing in you

except the will which says to them hold on

if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue

or walk with kings  nor lose the common touch

if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you

if all men count with you but none too much

if you can fill the unforgiving minute

with sixty seconds worth of distance run

yours is the earth and everything thats in it

and  which is more  youll be a man my son

let me be was all i wanted be what i am no matter how i am

life is pleasant death is peaceful its the transition thats troublesome

i think ive discovered the secret of life  you just hang around until you get used to it

growing up is losing some illusions in order to acquire others

there is not a particle of life which does not bear poetry within it

the thing about getting older is that you dont need everything to be possible any more you just need things to be certain

a pain stabbed my heart as it did every time i saw a girl i loved who was going the opposite direction in this toobig world

what good is the warmth of summer without the cold of winter to give it sweetness

dont be afraid of enemies who attack you be afraid of the friends who flatter you

every one of us is losing something precious to us lost opportunities lost possibilities feelings we can never get back again that’s part of what it means to be alive

almost nobody dances sober unless they happen to be insane

in the name of god stop a moment cease your work look around you

the trouble with being in the rat race is that even if you win youre still a rat

life is worth living as long as theres a laugh in it

there is some kind of a sweet innocence in being human in not having to be just happy or just sad in the nature of being able to be both broken and whole at the same time

life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced

she burned too bright for this world

we are all the pieces of what we remember we hold in ourselves the hopes and fears of those who love us as long as there is love and memory there is no true loss

great things happen to those who dont stop believing trying learning and being grateful

believe in your infinite potential your only limitations are those you set upon yourself

it’s your life you don’t need someone’s permission to live the life you want be brave to live from your heart

how people treat you is their karma how you react is yours

but how could you live and have no story to tell

the only person who can pull me down is myself and im not going to let myself pull me down anymore

every mans life ends the same way it is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another

in everybody’s life there’s a point of no return and in a very few cases a point where you can’t go forward anymore and when we reach that point all we can do is quietly accept the fact that’s how we survive

the biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams

if you want to make god laugh tell him about your plans

man is condemned to be free because once thrown into the world he is responsible for everything he does

it is up to you to give life a meaning

one lives in the hope of becoming a memory

thats what literature is its the people who went before us tapping out messages from the past from beyond the grave trying to tell us about life and death listen to them

the two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why

there is nothing more rare nor more beautiful than a woman being unapologetically herself comfortable in her perfect imperfection to me that is the true essence of beauty

accept what life offers you and try to drink from every cup all wines should be tasted some should only be sipped but with others drink the whole bottle

i believe that words are strong that they can overwhelm what we fear when fear seems more awful than life is good

ester asked why people are sad

no man ever steps in the same river twice for its not the same river and hes not the same man

the best things in life make you sweaty

i live my life in widening circles that reach out across the world

a man with outward courage dares to die a man with inner courage dares to live

hiding how you really feel and trying to make everyone happy doesnt make you nice it just makes you a liar

i don’t live in either my past or my future i’m interested only in the present if you can concentrate always on the present you’ll be a happy man life will be a party for you a grand festival because life is the moment we’re living now

the more you feed your mind with positive thoughts the more you can attract great things into your life

be brave and take risks you need to have faith in yourself be brave and take risks you dont have to have it all figured out to move forward

happiness depends on your mindset and attitude

do not lie to yourself

we have to be honest about what we want and take risks rather than lie to ourselves and make excuses to stay in our comfort zone

surround yourself with people who believe in your dreams

surround yourself with people who believe in your dreams encourage your ideas support your ambitions and bring out the best in you

if you believe very strongly in something stand up and fight for it

always remember people who have helped you along the way and don’t forget to lift someone up

sometimes the hardest part isnt letting go but rather learning to start over

never complain never explain resist the temptation to defend yourself or make excuses

there are two tragedies in life one is to lose your hearts desire the other is to gain it

do not despise your own place and hour every place is under the stars every place is the center of the world

i think prime numbers are like life they are very logical but you could never work out the rules even if you spent all your time thinking about them

when you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive to think to enjoy to love

nothing ever happens like you imagine it will

many people die at twenty five and arent buried until they are seventy five

believe something and the universe is on its way to being changed because youve changed by believing once youve changed other things start to follow isnt that the way it works

if theres a thing ive learned in my life its to not be afraid of the responsibility that comes with caring for other people what we do for love those things endure even if the people you do them for dont

the meaning of life is that it stops

as soon as you trust yourself you will know how to live

simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance

one choice decided your friends

one choice defines your beliefs

one choice determines your loyalties  forever

once choice can transform you

pull up a chair take a taste come join us life is so endlessly delicious

the world is a tragedy to those who feel but a comedy to those who think

when the going gets tough put one foot in front of the other and just keep going don’t give up

people are like stainedglass windows they sparkle and shine when the sun is out but when the darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within

when you do the right thing you get the feeling of peace and serenity associated with it do it again and again

do what you love love what you do and with all your heart give yourself to it

once you realize you deserve a bright future letting go of your dark past is the best choice you will ever make

the outer world is a reflection of the inner world other people’s perception of you is a reflection of them your response to them is an awareness of you

its never too late to change your life for the better you dont have to take huge steps to change your life making even the smallest changes to your daily routine can make a big difference to your life

strong people have a strong sense of selfworth and selfawareness they don’t need the approval of others

maturity is when you stop complaining and making excuses and start making changes

you spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth thinking about how youll escape one day and how awesome it will be and imagining that future keeps you going but you never do it you just use the future to escape the present

at the end of the day let there be no excuses no explanations no regrets

lifes as kind as you let it be

stop giving other people the power to control your happiness your mind and your life if you dont take control of yourself and your own life someone else is bound to try

i believe there is another world waiting for us a better world and ill be waiting for you there

we could do it you know

what

leave the district run off live in the woods you and i we could make it

i am fated to journey hand in hand with my strange heroes and to survey the surging immensity of life to survey it through the laughter that all can see and through the tears unseen and unknown by anyone

youre on earth theres no cure for that

the aim of life is to live and to live means to be aware joyously drunkenly serenely divinely aware

youve a good heart sometimes thats enough to see you safe wherever you go but mostly its not

its not the men in your life that matters its the life in your men

it all goes away eventually everything goes away

some of us get dipped in flat some in satin some in gloss he turned to me but every once in a while you find someone whos iridescent and when you do nothing will ever compare

over rock and under tree

by caves where never sun has shone

by streams that never find the sea

over snow by winter sown

and through the merry flowers of june

over grass and over stone

and under mountains in the moon

under cloud and under star

yet feet that wandering have gone

turn at last to home afar

eyes that fire and sword have seen

and horror in the halls of stone

look at last on meadows green

and trees and hills they long have known

the road goes ever on and on

down from the door where it began

now far ahead the road has gone

and i must follow if i can

pursuing it with eager feet

until it joins some larger way

where many paths and errands meet

the road goes ever on and on

down from the door where it began

now far ahead the road has gone

and i must follow if i can

pursuing it with weary feet

until it joins some larger way

where many paths and errands meet

and whither then i cannot say

the road goes ever on and on

out from the door where it began

now far ahead the road has gone

let others follow if they can

let them a journey new begin

but i at last with weary feet

will turn towards the lighted inn

my eveningrest and sleep to meet

to fear love is to fear life and those who fear life are already parts dead

the problem with people is they forget that most of the time its the small things that count

its better to burn out than to fade away

we all make mistakes have struggles and even regret things in our past but you are not your mistakes you are not your struggles and you are here now with the power to shape your day and your future

scar tissue is stronger than regular tissue realize the strength move on

parents were the only ones obligated to love you from the rest of the world you had to earn it

if you have a strong purpose in life you dont have to be pushed your passion will drive you there

focus on your strengths not your weaknesses

focus on your character not your reputation

when in a relationship a real man doesnt make his woman jealous of others he makes others jealous of his woman

develop an interest in life as you see it the people things literature music  the world is so rich simply throbbing with rich treasures beautiful souls and interesting people forget yourself

i learned this at least by my experiment that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours

wed start slow the way we always did because the run and the game could go on for awhile maybe even forever

when you can live forever what do you live for

lions hunker down

and even elephants

lumber after safety

when great trees fall

small things recoil into silence

their senses

the air around us becomes

we breathe briefly

our eyes briefly

see with

our memory suddenly sharpened

our reality bound to

them takes leave of us

our souls

dependent upon their

now shrink wizened

our minds formed

and informed by their

we are not so much maddened

as reduced to the unutterable ignorance

and when great souls die

after a period peace blooms

slowly and always

with a kind of

our senses restored never

to be the same whisper to us

we can be be and be

better for they existed

spring passes and one remembers ones innocence

summer passes and one remembers ones exuberance

my life didnt please me so i created my life

four be the things i am wiser to know

idleness sorrow a friend and a foe

four be the things id been better without

love curiosity freckles and doubt

three be the things i shall never attain

envy content and sufficient champagne

three be the things i shall have till i die

laughter and hope and a sock in the eye

tears idle tears i know not what they mean

tears from the depths of some devine despair

rise in the heart and gather to the eyes

in looking on the happy autumn fields

and thinking of the days that are no more

life is a series of pulls back and forth a tension of opposites like a pull on a rubber band most of us live somewhere in the middle a wrestling matchwhich side win love wins love always wins

sacrifice is a part of life its supposed to be its not something to regret its something to aspire to

you are the master of your attitude

you cannot control what happens to you but you can control the way you think about all the events you always have a choice you can choose to face them with a positive mental attitude

i was always an unusual girl

my mother told me i had a chameleon soul no moral compass pointing due north no fixed personality just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean

whenever something bad happens keep calm take a few deep breaths and shift the focus to something positive

there are ships sailing to many ports but not a single one goes where life is not painful

i see it all perfectly there are two possible situations — one can either do this or that my honest opinion and my friendly advice is this do it or do not do it — you will regret both

life although it may only be an accumulation of anguish is dear to me and i will defend it

i just wanted to tell you that i understand if you go it’s okay if you have to leave us it’s okay if you want to stop fighting

i dont want to achieve immortality through my work i want to achieve immortality through not dying i dont want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen i want to live on in my apartment

you dont have to disrespect and insult others simply to hold your own ground if you do that shows how shaky your own position is

love is our true destiny we do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone  we find it with another

knowledge like air is vital to life like air no one should be denied it

growing up happens when you start having things you look back on and wish you could change clary fray

it wasn’t my day my week my month my year my life god damn it

of all creatures that breathe and move upon the earth nothing is bred that is weaker than man

and through all that waiting here i am my life is passing day by day and i am waiting for it to start i am waiting for that time that person that event when my life will finally begin

your conscience is the measure of the honesty of your selfishness

listen to it carefully

i have often wished i had time to cultivate modestybut i am too busy thinking about myself

life was meant to be lived and curiosity must be kept alive one must never for whatever reason turn his back on life

successful people are always looking for opportunities to help others

unsuccessful people are always asking whats in it for me

how would your life be different if…you walked away from gossip and verbal defamation let today be the day…you speak only the good you know of other people and encourage others to do the same

there is nothing more frightful than ignorance in action

everyone is down on pain because they forget something important about it pain is for the living only the dead dont feel it

our lives are defined by opportunities even the ones we miss

very occasionally if you pay really close attention life doesnt suck

it was always the becoming he dreamed of never the being

yea all things live forever though at times they sleep and are forgotten

you do not immortalize the lost by writing about them language buries but does not resurrect

the story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye the story of love is hello and goodbyeuntil we meet again

who are you

are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies

have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them

i have i am fucking crazy

but i am free

dont think about making life better for other people who dont even deserve you rather focus on making your life the best for yourself and those who love you

i have no idea whats awaiting me or what will happen when this all ends for the moment i know this there are sick people and they need curing

if youve never eaten while crying you don t know what life tastes like

you never knew the last time you were seeing someone you didnt know when the last argument happened or the last time you had sex or the last time you looked into their eyes and thanked god they were in your life

after they were gone

that was all you thought about

day and night

cynics are simply thwarted romantics

prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away i think prime numbers are like life they are very logical but you could never work out the rules even if you spent all your time thinking about them

remember that everyone you meet is afraid of something loves something and has lost something

even for me life had its gleams of sunshine

the person you became with her is worth being

how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a weary world

a fit healthy body—that is the best fashion statement

closed in a room my imagination becomes the universe and the rest of the world is missing out

i would rather be ashes than dust

i would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dryrot

i would rather be a superb meteor every atom of me in magnificent glow than a sleepy and permanent planet

the function of man is to live not to exist

i shall not waste my days trying to prolong them

i shall use my time

forget yesterday  it has already forgotten you dont sweat tomorrow  you havent even met instead open your eyes and your heart to a truly precious gift  today

there are no random actswe are all connectedyou can no more separate one life from another than you can separate a breeze from the wind

life is like a novel its filled with suspense you have no idea what is going to happen until you turn the page

don’t let others tell you what you can’t do dont let the limitations of others limit your vision if you can remove your selfdoubt and believe in yourself you can achieve what you never thought possible

there comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page write another book or simply close it

its not what you say out of your mouth that determines your life its what you whisper to yourself that has the most power

oh dont cry im so sorry i cheated so much but thats the way things are

life is funny things change people change but you will always be you so stay true to yourself and never sacrifice who you are for anyone

we are all connected to each other biologically to the earth chemically to the rest of the universe atomically

and how are you feeling asked patrick

oh i’m grand augustus waters smiled with a corner of his mouth i’m on a roller coaster that only goes up my friend

i dont think that there are any limits to how excellent we could make life seem

the object of life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane

do not ask your children

to strive for extraordinary lives

such striving may seem admirable

but it is the way of foolishness

help them instead to find the wonder

and the marvel of an ordinary life

show them the joy of tasting

tomatoes apples and pears

show them how to cry

when pets and people die

show them the infinite pleasure

in the touch of a hand

and make the ordinary come alive for them

the extraordinary will take care of itself

life with its rules its obligations and its freedoms is like a sonnet youre given the form but you have to write the sonnet yourself  mrs whatsit

life doesn’t get easier or more forgiving we get stronger and more resilient

all human beings have three lives public private and secret

the future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour whatever he does whoever he is

life will not break your heart itll crush it

for i have known them all already known them all—

have known the evenings mornings afternoons

i have measured out my life with coffee spoons

it does not matter how long you are spending on the earth how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received it is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters

there is a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven

a time to be born and a time to die

a time to plant and a time to uproot

a time to kill and a time to heal

a time to tear down and a time to build

a time to weep and a time to laugh

a time to mourn and a time to dance

a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them

a time to embrace and a time to refrain

a time to search and a time to give up

a time to keep and a time to throw away

a time to tear and a time to mend

a time to be silent and a time to speak

a time to love and a time to hate

a time for war and a time for peace

there are it has been said two types of people in the world there are those who when presented with a glass that is exactly half full say this glass is half full and then there are those who say this glass is half empty

follow your bliss and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls

art is the proper task of life

nobody wants to be here and nobody wants to leave

i want words at my funeral but i guess that means you need life in your life

we are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works

a smart person knows how to talk a wise person knows when to be silent

in all of living have much fun and laughter life is to be enjoyed not just endured

at some point we all look up and realize we are lost in a maze

if there was anything that depressed him more than his own cynicism it was that quite often it still wasnt as cynical as real life

when a man cannot choose he ceases to be a man

amor fati – love your fate which is in fact your life

i want to live my life in such a way that when i get out of bed in the morning the devil says aw shit hes up

poetry is just the evidence of life if your life is burning well poetry is just the ash

this isnt life in the fast lane its life in the oncoming traffic

human beings are not born once and for all on the day their mothers give birth to them but  life obliges them over and over again to give birth to themselves

perhaps i know best why it is man alone who laughs he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter

when life gives you lemons chunk it right back

there was beauty in the idea of freedom but it was an illusion every human heart was chained by love

but i have learned that you make your own happiness that part of going for what you want means losing something else and when the stakes are high the losses can be that much greater

no one here gets out alive

as is a tale so is life not how long it is but how good it is is what matters

i wish you all very good lives

if you don’t give up on something you truly believe in you will find a way

we demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty

life is not a pg feelgood movie real life often ends badly literature tries to document this reality while showing us it is still possible for us to endure nobly

we choose our joys and sorrows long before we experience them

some things you hear with your ears others you hear with your heart

how terribly sad it was that people are made in such a way that they get used to something as extraordinary as living

the more you praise and celebrate your life the more there is in life to celebrate

you can live your whole life not realizing that what youre looking for is right in front of you

most everything you think you know about me is nothing more than memories

focus on your goals not your fear

focus like a laser beam on your goals

though the roads been rocky it sure feels good to me

im the girl nobody knows until she commits suicide then suddenly everyone had a class with her

each affects the other and the other affects the next and the world is full of stories but the stories are all one

i am not the same having seen the moon shine on the other side of the world

be the positive impact on the lives of others

you cant just plan a moment when things get back on track just as you cant plan the moment you lose your way in the first place

youre both the fire and the water that extinguishes it youre the narrator the protagonist and the sidekick youre the storyteller and the story told you are somebodys something but you are also your you

there is more to life than simply increasing its speed

the best way to predict your future is to create it

the human race tends to remember the abuses to which it has been subjected rather than the endearments whats left of kisses wounds however leave scars

you were born with potential

you were born with goodness and trust you were born with ideals and dreams you were born with greatness

you were born with wings

you are not meant for crawling so dont

you have wings

learn to use them and fly

be happy but never satisfied

dont confuse poor decisionmaking with destiny own your mistakes it’s ok we all make them learn from them so they can empower you

to look life in the face always to look life in the face and to know it for what it isat last to love it for what it is and then to put it away

do not lose hope — what you seek will be found trust ghosts trust those that you have helped to help you in their turn trust dreams trust your heart and trust your story from instructions

i dont get it caroline said bemused shes the only one with wings why is that

there were so many questions in life you couldnt ever have all the answers but i knew this one

its so she can fly i said then i started to run

in the end it wasnt death that surprised her but the stubbornness of life

unless you love them and then they can burn it down

yeah sometimes life really sucks she says but you know what im holding on for

i raise my eyebrows

she raises hers too mimicking me

the moments that dont suck she says the trick is to notice them when they come around

you cant become a decent horseman until you fall off and get up again a good number of times

theres life in a nutshell

integrity is doing the right thing when nobodys watching and doing as you say you would do

discipline your mind to think positively discipline your mind to see the good in every situation and look on the best side of every event

you don’t have to like someone but you have to treat them as you wish to be treated

style is the answer to everything

a fresh way to approach a dull or dangerous thing

to do a dull thing with style is preferable to doing a dangerous thing without it

to do a dangerous thing with style is what i call art

bullfighting can be an art

boxing can be an art

loving can be an art

opening a can of sardines can be an art

not many have style

not many can keep style

i have seen dogs with more style than men

although not many dogs have style

cats have it with abundance

when hemingway put his brains to the wall with a shotgun

that was style

or sometimes people give you style

john the baptist

i have met men in jail with style

i have met more men in jail with style than men out of jail

style is the difference a way of doing a way of being done

or you naked walking out of the bathroom without seeing me

life is a journey time is a river the door is ajar

if you need something from somebody always give that person a way to hand it to you

he died that day because his body had served its purpose his soul had done what it came to do learned what it came to learn and then was free to leave

theres gon be some stuff you gon see

thats gon make it hard to smile in the future

but through whatever you see

through all the rain and the pain

you gotta keep your sense of humor

you gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit

remember that

hardships make or break people

the laughing heart

your life is your life

don’t let it be clubbed into dank submission

be on the watch

there are ways out

there is a light somewhere

it may not be much light but

it beats the darkness

be on the watch

the gods will offer you chances

know them

take them

you can’t beat death but

you can beat death in life sometimes

and the more often you learn to do it

the more light there will be

your life is your life

know it while you have it

you are marvelous

the gods wait to delight

in you

turn your obstacles into opportunities and your problems into possibilities

taking pictures is savoring life intensely every hundredth of a second

and therein lies the whole of mans plight human time does not turn in a circle it runs ahead in a straight line that is why man cannot be happy happiness is the longing for repetition

cinema is the ultimate pervert art it doesnt give you what you desire  it tells you how to desire

we’d met at a carefree time a moment full of promise in its place now were the harsh lessons of the real world

its worth making time to find the things that really stir your soul that’s what makes you really feel alive you have to say ‘no’ to other things you’re used to and do it with all your heart

dreams dont work unless you take action the surest way to make your dreams come true is to live them

i seem to have run in a great circle and met myself again on the starting line

to sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world thats what everybody does every hour of his life if i asked you to keep your soul  would you understand why thats much harder

but if everything was always smooth and perfect youd get too used to that you know you have to have a little bit of disorganization now and then otherwise youll never really enjoy it when things go right

keep love in your heart a life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead the consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring

there was a moment in my life when i really wanted to kill myself and there was one other moment when i was close to that    but even in my most jaded times i had some hope

i dont know why we are here but im pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves

art is to console those who are broken by life

quiet is peace tranquility quiet is turning down the volume knob on life silence is pushing the off button shutting it down all of it  amir

after all whats a life anyway were born we live a little while we die

if you dont know who you truly are youll never know what you really want

the more i live the more i learn the more i learn the more i realize the less i know

you’re not obligated to win you’re obligated to keep trying to the best you can do everyday

when you hold a grudge you want someone else’s sorrow to reflect your level of hurt but the two rarely meet

the cost of a thing is the amount of what i will call life which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run

never let hard lessons harden your heart the hard lessons of life are meant to make you better not bitter

you are  your life and nothing else

life gives us choices you either grab on with both hands and just go for it or you sit on the sidelines

learning to distance yourself from all the negativity is one of the greatest lessons to achieve inner peace

what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying

being happy doesnt mean that everything is perfect it means that youve decided to look beyond the imperfections

never respond to an angry person with a fiery comeback even if he deserves itdont allow his anger to become your anger

the worst memories stick with us while the nice ones always seem to slip through our fingers

life is a gift dont forget to live it

our revels now are ended these our actors

as i foretold you were all spirits and

are melted into air into thin air

and like the baseless fabric of this vision

the cloudcapp’d towers the gorgeous palaces

the solemn temples the great globe itself

yea all which it inherit shall dissolve

and like this insubstantial pageant faded

as dreams are made on and our little life

is rounded with a sleep

of the endless trains of the faithless—of cities fill’d with the foolish

of myself forever reproaching myself for who more foolish than i and who more faithless

of eyes that vainly crave the light—of the objects mean—of the struggle ever renew’d

of the poor results of all—of the plodding and sordid crowds i see around me

of the empty and useless years of the rest—with the rest me intertwined

the question o me so sad recurring—what good amid these o me o life

failure is a bend in the road not the end of the road learn from failure and keep moving forward

nothing ever happens quickly except when it does nothing is ever ever easy except when it is and most of all nothing ever goes perfectly according to plan except in the movies

it can take years to mold a dream it takes only a fraction of a second for it to be shattered

dream your own dreams achieve your own goals your journey is your own and unique

but we accept irony through a device called metaphor and through that we grow and become deeper human beings

because isn’t that the point of every relationship to be known by someone else to be understood he gets me she gets me isn’t that the simple magic phrase

all that is important is this one moment in movement make the moment important vital and worth living do not let it slip away unnoticed and unused

selling my soul would be a lot easier if i could just find it

me i refuse to attend support group

mom one of the symptoms of depression is disinterest in activities

me please just let me watch america’s next top model it’s an activity

mom television is a passivity

mom hazel you’re a teenager you’re not a little kid anymore you need to make friends get out of the house and live your life

me if you want me to be a teenager don’t send me to support group buy me a fake id so i can go to clubs drink vodka and take pot

mom you don’t take pot for starters

me see that’s the kind of thing i’d know if you got me a fake id

mom you’re going to support group

mom hazel you deserve a life

great leaders create more leaders

good leaders have vision and inspire others to help them turn vision into reality great leaders create more leaders not followers great leaders have vision share vision and inspire others to create their own

life is but a dream for the dead

stay hungry stay young stay foolish stay curious and above all stay humble because just when you think you got all the answers is the moment when some bitter twist of fate in the universe will remind you that you very much dont

every choice comes with a consequence once you make a choice you must accept responsibility you cannot escape the consequences of your choices whether you like them or not

how much you can learn when you fail determines how far you will go into achieving your goals

push your boundaries beyond the ordinary be that extra in extraordinary

normal is an illusion what is normal for the spider is chaos for the fly

wisdom is having things right in your life

and knowing why

the tragedy of life is what dies inside a man while he lives

i definitely learned a lesson this time i know that i can be broken i am not as tough as i thought i see it now at this point its the only thing good that came out of all of this i know myself better now and know what i have to do

all that happens means something nothing you do is ever insignificant

the right thing to do and the hard thing to do are usually the same

you need to spend time crawling alone through shadows to truly appreciate what it is to stand in the sun

i have noticed that even those who assert that everything is predestined and that we can change nothing about it still look both ways before they cross the street

its good to do uncomfortable things its weight training for life

i am suddenly comsumed by nostalgia for the little girl who was me who loved the fields and believed in god who spent winter days home sick from school reading nancy drew and sucking menthol cough drops who could keep a secret

love like everything else in life should be a discovery an adventure and like most adventures you don’t know you’re having one until you’re right in the middle of it

i feel sorry for anyone who is in a place where he feels strange and stupid

a boo is a lot louder than a cheer

jamie you know what i figured out today

landon what

jamie maybe god has a bigger plan for me than i had for myself like this journey never ends like you were sent to me because im sick to help me through all this youre my angel

life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent

those who have never known the deep intimacy and the intense companionship of happy mutual love have missed the best thing that life has to give

live fast die young be wild have fun

hopes are like hair ornaments girls want to wear too many of them when they become old women they look silly wearing even one

a bend in the road is not the end of the road…unless you fail to make the turn

i always had this idea that you should never give up a happy middle in the hopes of a happy ending because there is no such thing as a happy ending do you know what i mean there is so much to lose

and when i saw himmy father lying dead in a pool of his own blood i knew then that i hadnt stopped believing in god id just stopped believing god cared there might be a god clary and there might be not either way were on our own

what strange phenomena we find in a great city all we need do is stroll about with our eyes open life swarms with innocent monsters

im not crying because of you youre not worth it im crying because my delusion of who you were was shattered by the truth of who you are

ive come to believe that all my past failure and frustration were actually laying

the foundation for the understandings that have created the new level of living i

now enjoy

change course but don’t give up

do your own thing on your own terms and get what you came here for

books can be dangerous the best ones should be labeled ‘this could change your life’

even chance meetings are the result of karma… things in life are fated by our previous lives that even in the smallest events there’s no such thing as coincidence

art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness it trains the mind through the eye and the eye through the mind as the sun colors flowers so does art color life

before i can live with other folks i’ve got to live with myself the one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience

you are a child of the universe

no less than the trees and the stars

you have a right to be here

and whether or not it is clear to you

no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should

there is no escape—we pay for the violence of our ancestors

what makes earth feel like hell is our expectation that it should feel like heaven

do not let your difficulties fill you with anxiety after all it is only in the darkest nights that stars shine more brightly

no one ever does live happily ever after but we leave the children to find that out for themselves

we never live we are always in the expectation of living

i think computer viruses should count as life  i think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive weve created life in our own image

man starts over again everyday in spite of all he knows against all he knows

life is not complex we are complex life is simple and the simple thing is the right thing

that’s how i know they are dreams because the simple and plain and everyday things are the ones that we can never have cassia reyes

we can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures

as we go through life we gradually discover who we are but the more we discover the more we lose ourselves

we are born in one day we die in one day we can change in one day and we can fall in love in one day anything can happen in just one day

i only want to write and theres no college for that except life

in the book of life the answers arent in the back

so he tasted the deep pain that is reserved only for the strong just as he had tasted for a little while the deep happiness

life will defend itself no matter how small it is

our lives cant be measured by our final years of this i am sure

so this is for us

this is for us who sing write dance act study run and love

and this is for doing it even if no one will ever know

because the beauty is in the act of doing it

not what it can lead to

this is for the times i lose myself while writing singing playing

and no one is around and they will never know

but i will forever remember

and that shines brighter than any praise or fame or glory i will ever have

and this is for you who write or play or read or sing

by yourself with the light off and door closed

when the world is asleep and the stars are aligned

and maybe no one will ever hear it

or read your words

or know your thoughts

but it doesn’t make it less glorious

it makes it ethereal mysterious

for it belongs to you and whatever god or spirit you believe in

and only you can decide how much it meant

and means

and will forever mean

and other people will experience it too

through you

through your spirit through the way you talk

through the way you walk and love and laugh and care

and i never meant to write this long

but what i want to say is

and let your very existence be your song your poem your story

let your very identity be your book

let the way people say your name sound like the sweetest melody

so go create take photographs in the wood run alone in the rain and sing your heart out high up on a mountain

where no one will ever hear

and your very existence will be the most hypnotising scar

make your life be your art

and you will never be forgotten

i told him a story of two people two people who shouldnt have met and who didnt like each other much when they did but who found they were the only two people in the world who could possibly have understood each other

in case you never get a second chance dont be afraid and what if you do get a second chance you take it

don’t worry if people think you’re crazy you are crazy you have that kind of intoxicating insanity that lets other people dream outside of the lines and become who they’re destined to be

it’s not that we have to quit

this life one day but it’s how

many things we have to quit

all at once music laughter

the physics of falling leaves

the scent of rain the concept

of subway trains if only one

could leave this life slowly

i believe in looking reality straight in the eye and denying it

let all of life be an unfettered howl

i am nothing more than the consequence of catastrophe

always forgive but never forget else you will be a prisoner of your own hatred and doomed to repeat your mistakes forever

a joke is a very serious thing

develop an attitude of gratitude and give thanks for everything that happens to

you knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something

bigger and better than your current situation

we walk on hell

that’s how stories happen — with a turning point an unexpected twist there’s only one kind of happiness but misfortune comes in all shapes and sizes it’s like tolstoy said happiness is an allegory unhappiness a story

positive expectations are the mark of the superior personality

most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years

no one has ever achieved greatness without dreams

the absence of the will to live is alas not sufficient to make one want to die

it’s probably my job to tell you life isn’t fair but i figure you already know that so instead i’ll tell you that hope is precious and you’re right not to give up

all sacrifice and suffering is redemptive it is used to either teach the individual or to help others nothing is by chance

in dwelling live close to the ground in thinking keep to the simple in conflict be fair and generous in governing dont try to control in work do what you enjoy in family life be completely present

i don’t want life to imitate art i want life to be art

i haven’t been very impressed lately

by people

or places

or the way someone said he loved me and then slowly changed his mind

the irony of life is that those who wear masks often tell us more truths than those with open faces

you can have everything you want if you can put your heart and soul into everything you do

it is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquility they must have action and they will make it if they cannot find it

never lose faith in yourself and never lose hope remember even when this world throws its worst and then turns its back there is still always hope

do not let your negative thoughts have power over you because those thoughts will end up controlling your life no one can live a positive life with a negative mind

if you cant do anything about it laugh like hell

when you arise in the morning think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive—to breathe to think to enjoy to love—then make that day count

life will hit you hard in the face wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach but getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air

life is  percent what you make it

and  percent how you take it

my life is a reading list

love demands everything they say but my love demands only this that no matter what happens or how long it takes youll keep faith in me youll remember who we are and youll never feel despair

people do not die for us immediately but remain bathed in a sort of aura of

life which bears no relation to true immortality but through which they

continue to occupy our thoughts in the same way as when they were alive it

is as though they were traveling abroad

life is a drama full of tragedy and comedy you should learn to enjoy the comic episodes a little more

all religions arts and sciences are branches of the same tree all these aspirations are directed toward ennobling mans life lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom

when were connected to others we become better people

failures are the stairs we climb to reach success

a mans work is nothing but this slow trek to rediscover through the detours of art those two or three great and simple images in whose presence his heart first opened

the moment a little boy is concerned with which is a jay and which is a sparrow he can no longer see the birds or hear them sing

it is life i think to watch the water a man can learn so many things

alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way

dont blow off anothers candle for it wont make yours shine brighter

create a vision for the life you really want and then work relentlessly towards making it a reality

what i want is so simple i almost cant say it elementary kindness

life seems to go on without effort when i am filled with music

love is forgiving accepting moving on embracing and all encompassing and if you’re not doing that for yourself you cannot do that with anyone else

it is hard work and great art to make life not so serious

but the only way never to do the wrong thing is never to do anything

some things in life are too complicated to explain in any language

son everyone dies alone thats what it is its a door its one person wide when you go through it you do it alone but it doesnt mean youve got to be alone before you go through the door and believe me you arent alone on the other side

life would be unbearably dull if we had answers to all our questions

and though you think the world is at your feet it can rise up and tread on you

too many people seem to believe that silence was a void that needed to be filled even if nothing important was said

life is but a day

a fragile dewdrop on its perilous way

from a tree’s summit

my point is life is about balance the good and the bad the highs and the lows the pina and the colada

love is hard to find hard to keep and hard to forget

life is too short when you think of the length of death

in order to move on you must understand why you felt what you did and why you no longer need to feel it

whoever loves becomes humble those who love have  so to speak  pawned a part of their narcissism

do every act of your life as though it were the very last act of your life

life is a funny thing we only get so many years to live it so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be we shouldnt waste time on things that might happen someday or maybe even never

going back to something is harder than you think

if youre not comfortable enough with yourself or with your own truth when entering a relationship then youre not ready for that relationship

if you spend your life sparing people’s feelings and feeding their vanity you get so you can’t distinguish what should be respected in them

free yourself from the complexities and drama of your life simplify look within within ourselves we all have the gifts and talents we need to fulfill the purpose weve been blessed with

its all crap

life has no meaning

none nowhere to be found

why doesnt anybody realize this

you can go your whole life collecting days and none will outweigh the one you wish you had back

if i had a camera i said id take a picture of you every day that way id remember how you looked every single day of your life

because horror on earth is real and it is every day it is like a flower or like the sun it cannot be contained

no matter how much experience you have there’s always something new you can learn and room for improvement

what if i mess up

oh you will youll mess up youll make mistakes youll break things some youll be able to piece together and others youll lose thats all a given but theres only one thing you have to do for me

whats that

stay alive long enough to mess up again

im sure you think that i dont understand what youre going through but i do its just that sometimes our future is dictated by what we are opposed to what we want

by the way when oprah winfrey is suggesting you may have overextended yourself you need to examine your fucking life

everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content

be where you are stop overthinking and focus on what you are doing

love the trees until their leaves fall off then encourage them to try again next year

and if youve managed to drag yourself from the bed and go down the road to the garden center or the drug store by then the worst is over at that point you might as well just go to work

the greatest step towards a life of simplicity is to learn to let go

life isn’t about what you get it’s about what you do with what you get

when she is happy she cant stop talking when she is sad she doesnt say a word

life is a long lesson in humility

everyone has his own reality in which if one is not too cautious timid or frightened one swims this is the only reality there is

i do not forget any good deed done to me  i do not carry a grudge for a bad one

those with a grateful mindset tend to see the message in the mess and even though life may knock them down the grateful find reasons if even small ones to get up

remember how it was when we kissed armfuls and armfuls of light thrown right at us a rope dropping down from the sky how can the word love and the word life even fit in the mouth

i have a deeply hidden and inarticulate desire for something beyond the daily life

now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good god would permit us to be pirates

when you are measuring life you are not living it

thats the thing about life a lot of the time it isnt easy at all we just have to try to make the best of it

despite the mayhem that followed bruno found that he was still holding shmuels hand in his own and nothing in the world would have persuaded him to let go

may you live as long as you wish and love as long as you live

beauty is a whore i like money better

we have nothing to lose nothing to gain nothing we desired anymore except to make our lives into a work of art

who would have guessed that four minutes could change everything

live and act within the limit of your knowledge and keep expanding it to the limit of your life

dancers are the athletes of god

your life is happening right now dont let procrastination take over your life be brave and take risks your life is happening right now

my love is pizza shaped won’t you have a slice it’s circular so there’s enough to go around

another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing

i still find each day too short for all the thoughts i want to think all the walks i want to take all the books i want to read and all the friends i want to see

i love the lord for he heard my voice he heard my cry for mercy because he turned his ear to me i will call on him as long as i live psalms  niv

pain or love or danger makes you real again

dignity is as essential to human life as water food and oxygen the stubborn retention of it even in the face of extreme physical hardship can hold a mans soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it

the lord prefers commonlooking people that is why he made so many of them

i am not good at noticing when im happy except in retrospect

the end is in the beginning and yet you go on

you will suffer son of hades’

what else is new nico thought

the life where nothing was ever unexpected or inconvenient or unusual the life without colour pain or past

we should live our lives as though christ was coming this afternoon

look for the good in every person and every situation youll almost always

find it

when you lose your smile you lose your way in the chaos of life

life’s greatest gift is the freedom it leaves you to step out of it whenever you choose

the fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence

to invent your own lifes meaning is not easy but its still allowed and i think youll be happier for the trouble

its such a shame to waste time we always think we have so much of it

you know how both life and porno movies end the only difference is life starts with the orgasm

id found out that if you pushed people away hard enough they tended to go

i want to be the best version of myself for anyone who is going to someday walk into my life and need someone to love them beyond reason

life isnt worth living unless it is lived for someone else

i cant you cant rewrite the past

when it was over she gathered him in her arms and told him the terrible irony of her life

that she had wanted to be dead all those years while her brother had been alive that had been her sin

and this was her penance

wanting to live when everyone else seemed dead

to overcome fear is the quickest way to gain your selfconfidence

be careful the stories youre telling yourself about your current circumstances a head full of negative thoughts has no space for positive ones

and these children that you spit on

as they try to change their worlds

are immune to your consultations

theyre quite aware of what theyre going through

ive come to believe that in everyones life theres one undeniable moment of change a set of circumstances that suddenly alters everything

depression isnt a war you win its a battle you fight every day you never stop never get to rest its one bloody fray after another

after you find out all the things that can go wrong your life becomes less about living and more about waiting

turning your back on

if you love it

at  everyone has the face he deserves

here’s to freedom cheers to art here’s to having an excellent adventure and may the stopping never start

can a person steal happiness or is just another internal infernal human trick

when forever becomes a placewhen forever ceases to be just a word… when it ceases to be just a measurement of time…but instead becomes a place where soul mates can dance to the song in their hearts that is a reflection of true love

while we try to teach our children all about life our children teach us what life is all about

you dont ask people with knives in their stomachs what would make them happy happiness is no longer the point its all about survival its all about whether you pull the knife out and bleed to death or keep it in

life is full of grief to exactly the degree we allow ourselves to love other people

all of us have a place in history mine is clouds

if you care about something enough youll find a way to make it happen

never try to do anything that is outside of who you are a forced smile is a sign of what feels wrong in your heart so recognize it when it happens living a lie will reduce you to one

thats the problem with life you never get enough time to stare at your ceiling and try to figure out whats going on

not that kind of screwed what i mean is theyre always on the short end of things

the way things work how

guys feel great but make girls feel

cheap for doing

exactly what

they beg for

the way they get to play you

all the while claiming they

love you and making you

believe its

the way its okay to gift their heart one day a backhand the next

to move on to the apricot

when the peach blushes and bruises

these things make me believe gods a man after all

we are all ordinary we are all boring we are all spectacular we are all shy we are all bold we are all heroes we are all helpless it just depends on the day

i don’t chase after anyone if you wanna walk out of my life then i’ll hold the fucking door open for you

let go of something old that no longer serves you to make room for something new

if you cant control your peanut butter you cant expect to control your life

dont worry be happy

you fear to die

its not that i dont want i mean ive alwaysits just that life is a habit thats hard to break

and for better

it wasnt easy the world was complicated life was hard and so often living hurt

so make it worth the pain

dreams are necessary to life

one of the greatest journeys in life is overcoming insecurity and learning to truly not give a shit

this work was strictly voluntary but any animal who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half

i hope you live a life you’re proud of if you find that you’re not i hope you have the strength to start all over again

it has shown me that everything is illuminated in the light of the past it is always along the side of uson the inside looking out

i dont want to do anything i dont even want to start this day because then ill just be expected to finish it

droll thing life is  that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose the most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself  that comes too late  a crop of inextinguishable regrets

she had been given a wonderful gift life sometimes it was cruelly taken away too soon but its what you did with it that counted not how long it lasted

it is not worth the while to let our imperfections disturb us always

i never ask a man what his business is for it never interests me what i ask him about are his thoughts and dreams

in fairy tales the princesses kiss the frogs and the frogs become princes in real life the pricesses kiss princes and the princes turn into frogs

after youre gone people will forget your name no matter how important it was and your face no matter how pretty it was and what you said no matter how clever any of it sounded

the things youve done will crumble and fade and the places you once loved will change and be given new names

you are only here for one moment and it lasts exactly one lifetime

no man ever threw away life while it was worth keeping

my only regrets are the moments when i doubted myself and took the safe route life is too short to waste time being unhappy

the true hypocrite is the one who ceases to perceive his deception the one who lies with sincerity

youve never lived what you are thinking and that isnt good only the ideas we actually live are of any value

we live in a dark and romantic and quite tragic world

i came here looking for a great perhaps for real friends and a morethanminor life

its easy to look back and see it and its easy to give the advice but the sad fact is most people dont look beneath the surface until its too late

if you only shine light on your flaws all your perfects will dim

one can be very much in love with a woman without wishing to spend the rest of ones life with her

there is no such thing as worklife balance everything worth fighting for unbalances your life

everything changes in my life and the world stays the same

i’m a fake fact factory the things i make are the things i make up also as a side business i make love actually i just made that up

it is wise to direct your anger towards problems  not people to focus your energies on answers  not excuses

give a bowl of rice to a man and you will feed him for a day teach him how to grow his own rice and you will save his life

some beautiful paths cant be discovered without getting lost

you often meet your fate on the road you take to avoid it

sorrow looks back worry looks around faith looks up

to regret one’s own experiences is to arrest one’s own development to deny one’s own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of one’s own life it is no less than a denial of the soul

you might want to decide fast we live in a dangerous world if you see a chance to be happy you have to fight for it so later you have no regrets

fate loves the fearless

the problem of course was that he saw the world in black and white and he got to decide what was black and what was white you cant love a person who lives that way without fearing him too maybe even hating him a little

the moon did her best she carved each of these blocks of sorrow into a man or a woman she spent the rest of her time watching out so that her other stars wouldnt fall she spent the rest of her time holding onto whatever scraps she had left

i do not love men i love what devours them

the trick is to enjoy life dont wish away your days waiting for better ones ahead

do you ever wonder whether people would like you more or less if they could see inside you but i always wonder about that if people could see me the way i see myself—if they could live in my memories—would anyone anyone love me

focus on making yourself better not on thinking that you are better

anything can happen in life especially nothing

rise to the occassion which is life

thats what i love about aibileen she can take the most complicated things in life and wrap them up so small and simple theyll fit right in your pocket

she felt how life from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up with it and threw one down with it there with a dash on the beach

did you ever when you were little endure your parents’ warnings then wait for them to leave the room pry loose protective covers and consider inserting some metal object into an electrical outlet

did you wonder if for once you might light up the room

when you were big enough to cross the street on your own did you ever wait for a signal hear the frenzied approach of a fire truck and feel like stepping out in front of it

did you wonder just how far that rocket ride might take you

when you were almost grown did you ever sit in a bubble bath perspiration pooling notice a blow dryer plugged in within easy reach and think about dropping it into the water

did you wonder if the expected rush might somehow fail you

and now do you ever dangle your toes over the precipice dare the cliff to crumble defy the frozen deity to suffer the sun thaw feather and bone take wing to fly you home

sometimes things happen to people and theyre not equipped to deal with them

if people do not believe that mathematics is simple it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is

we are the cosmos made conscious and life is the means by which the universe understands itself

life—the way it really is—is a battle not between good and bad but between bad and worse

all the worlds a stage

and all the men and women merely players

they have their exits and their entrances

and one man in his time plays many parts

his acts being seven ages at first the infant

mewling and puking in the nurses arms

then the whining schoolboy with his satchel

and shining morning face creeping like snail

unwillingly to school and then the lover

sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad

made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier

full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard

jealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel

seeking the bubble reputation

even in the cannons mouth and then the justice

in fair round belly with good capon lined

with eyes severe and beard of formal cut

full of wise saws and modern instances

and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts

into the lean and slippered pantaloon

with spectacles on nose and pouch on side

his youthful hose well saved a world too wide

for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice

turning again toward childish treble pipes

and whistles in his sound last scene of all

that ends this strange eventful history

is second childishness and mere oblivion

art is the reason i get up in the morning but the definition ends there it doesnt seem fair that im living for something i cant even define

i believe when life gives you lemons you should make lemonadeand try to find someone whose life has given them vodka and have a party

freedom is the only worthy goal in life it is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control

i dont pray really because i dont want to bore god

i would not have you descend into your own dream i would have you be a conscious citizen of this terrible and beautiful world

no matter where you are youre always a bit on your own always an outsider

one who makes himself a worm cannot complain afterwards if people step on him

don’t let mental blocks control you set yourself free confront your fear and turn the mental blocks into building blocks

to live is to be musical starting with the blood dancing in your veins everything living has a rhythm do you feel your music

millions long for immortality who dont know what to do with themselves on a rainy sunday afternoon

you can be young without money but you cant be old without it

if someone does not want me it is not the end of the world but if i do not want me the world is nothing but endings

chiron had said once that nations were the most foolish of mortal inventions no man is worth more than another wherever he is from

but what if he is your friend achilles had asked him feet kicked up on the wall of the rosequartz cave or your brother should you treat him the same as a stranger

you ask a question that philosophers argue over chiron had said he is worth more to you perhaps but the stranger is someone else’s friend and brother so which life is more important

we had been silent we were fourteen and these things were too hard for us now that we are twentyseven they still feel too hard

he is half of my soul as the poets say he will be dead soon and his honor is all that will remain it is his child his dearest self should i reproach him for it i have saved briseis i cannot save them all

i know now how i would answer chiron i would say there is no answer whichever you choose you are wrong

there are things that will never change things we will carry along with us always but as we venture into the murky future we must find our strength by learning to leave things behind

were so engaged in doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget the inner value the rapture that is associated with being alive is what it is all about

please touch me i pray

life is more fun if you play games

life doesnt require ideals it requires standards of action

instead of worrying about what could go wrong change your thoughts to what could go right when you change the negative thought into a positive one it eliminates the negative one

love and friendship they are what make us who we are and what can change us if we let them

along with the idea of romantic love she was introduced to anotherphysical beauty probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought both originated in envy thrived in insecurity and ended in disillusion

be so good they cant ignore you

your time may come do not be too sad sam you cannot be always torn in two you will have to be one and whole for many years you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do

never compete with someone who has nothing to lose

you have stories worth telling memories worth remembering dreams worth working toward a body worth feeding a soul worth tending and beyond that the god of the universe dwells within you the true culmination of super and natural

you are more than dust and bones

you are spirit and power and image of god

and you have been given today

that’s life for you all the happiness you gather to yourself it will sweep away like it’s nothing if you ask me i don’t think there are any such things as curses i think there is only life that’s enough

you dont know me you know one me just like i know one you and you cant know every me and i cant know every you

the fact that life has no meaning is a reason to live moreover the only one

single is no longer a lack of options – but a choice a choice to refuse to let your life be defined by your relationship status but to live every day happily and let your ever after work itself out

perfection of character is this to live each day as if it were your last without frenzy without apathy without pretence

when we fail to set boundaries and hold people accountable we feel used and mistreated this is why we sometimes attack who they are which is far more hurtful than addressing a behavior or a choice

life is like a grapefruit well its sort of orangeyyellow and dimpled on the outside wet and squidgy in the middle its got pips inside too oh and some people have half a one for breakfast

it is after all so easy to shatter a story to break a chain of thought to ruin a fragment of a dream being carried around carefully like a piece of porcelain to let it be to travel with it as velutha did is much the harder thing to do

its good to let god pick a man for you we dont do so well when we pick them ourselves they end up lipsticks in a drawer all those wrong colors you thought looked so good in the package

exactly said deep thought so once you do know what the question actually is youll know what the answer means

the connections we make in the course of a lifemaybe thats what heaven is

do not look back and grieve over the past for it is gone and do not be troubled about the future for it has yet to come live in the present and make it so beautiful that it will be worth remembering

disappointment came to me

and booted me

and bruised and hurt me

but thats how people grow up

you don’t get to pick where you’re from but you always have control of where you’re going

life is partly what we make it and partly what it is made by the friends we choose

the monsters were never

under my bed

because the monsters

were inside my head

i fear no monsters

for no monsters i see

because all this time

the monster has been me

the bounties of space of infinite outwardness were three empty heroics low comedy and pointless death

you make the world a better place by making daily improvements to become the best version of yourself

my heart is afraid that it will have to suffer

people are going to say what they want to say and think what they want to think and i cant change their minds

maybe you could be mine  or maybe we’ll be entwined  aimless in this sexless foreplay

for beautiful eyes look for the good in others for beautiful lips speak only words of kindness and for poise walk with the knowledge that you are never alone

i saw the world from the stars point of view and it looked unbearably lonely

the world will give you that once in awhile a brief timeout the boxing bell rings and you go to your corner where somebody dabs mercy on your beatup life

happiness is part of who we are joy is the feeling

go for it while you can i know you have it in you and i cant promise youll get everything you want but i can promise nothing will change if you dont try

the most important relationship in your life is the relationship you have with yourself because no matter what happens you will always be with yourself

good works is giving to the poor and the helpless but divine works is showing them their worth to the one who matters

gamble everything for love if youre a true human being

when all is said and done the life of faith is nothing if not an unending struggle of the spirit with every available weapon against the flesh

i wonder if thats how darkness wins by convincing us to trap it inside ourselves instead of emptying it out

i dont want it to win

to live is to war with trolls

no matter how hard life is dont lose hope

and were an epitaph to be my story id have a short one ready for my own i would have written of me on my stone i had a lovers quarrel with the world

she smiled and said with an ecstatic air it shines like a little diamond

what does

this moment it is round it hangs in empty space like a little diamond i am eternal

the deepest wounds arent the ones we get from other people hurting us they are the wounds we give ourselves when we hurt other people

have you ever hoped for something and held out for it against all the odds until everything you did was ridiculous

some say life is the thing but i prefer reading

what helps you persevere is your resilience and commitment

no’ nico said ‘getting a second life is one thing making it a better life that’s the trick’ as soon as he said it nico realized he could’ve been talking about himself he decided not to bring that up

there are things you cant walk away from not if you want to live with yourself afterward

each time we dont say what we wanna say were dying

how can you still count yourself a knight when you have forsaken every vow you ever swore

sometimes life is very mean a person can spend days weeks months and years without feeling new then when a door opens  a positive avalanche pours in one moment you have nothing the next you have more than you can cope with

the behavior of a human being in sexual matters is often a prototype for the whole of his other modes of reaction in life

you dont dwell on what youve lost you just move onallison

an ability to look into the confusing mess of life and see things for what they are

you look ridiculous if you dance

you look ridiculous if you dont dance

so you might as well

a home filled with nothing but yourself its heavy that lightness its crushing that emptiness

einmal ist keinmal says tomas to himself what happens but once says the german adage might as well not have happened at all if we have only one life to live we might as well not have lived at all

i like shape very much a novel has to have shape and life doesnt have any

i am old enough to know only too well my good and bad qualities which were often one in the same

time ticks by we grow older before we know it too much time has passed and weve missed the chance to have had other people hurt us to a younger me this sounded like luck to an older me this sounds like a quiet tragedy

when you say i and my too much you lose the capacity to understand the we and our

it would be so nice if something made sense for a change

if fate doesnt make you laugh you just dont get the joke

you are never alone you are eternally connected with everyone

we cant become what we need to be by remaining what we are

a woman laughing is a woman conquered

regret is mostly caused by not having

sometimes you have to be a bitch to get things done

security is mostly a superstition it does not exist in nature nor do the children of men as a whole experience it avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure life is either a daring adventure or nothing

i know there may be universes out there where i made different choices and they led me somewhere else led me to someone else and my heart breaks for every single version of me that didnt end up with you

home is where somebody notices when you are no longer there

good memories are like charmseach is special you collect them one by one until one day you look back and discover they make a long colorful bracelet

were all made of stories when they finally put us underground the stories are what will go on not forever perhaps but for a time its a kind of immortality i suppose bounded by limits its true but then sos everything

why did i write because i found life unsatisfactory

if something doesnt work exactly right or maybe needs some special treatment you dont just throw it away everything cant be fully operational all the time sometimes we need to have the patience to give something the little nudge it needs

i run after her not really giving chase i’m running because i can because i must

because i want to see how far i can go before i have to stop

whatever is going to happen will happen whether we worry or not

a feeling is no longer the same when it comes the second time it dies through the awareness of its return we become tired and weary of our feelings when they come too often and last too long

theres nothing wrong with not understanding yourself

you enter the forest

at the darkest point

where there is no path

where there is a way or path

it is someone elses path

you are not on your own path

if you follow someone elses way

you are not going to realize

your potential

realize deeply that the present moment is all you will ever have

it is a curious situation that the sea from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life but the sea though changed in a sinister way will continue to exist the threat is rather to life itself

dont wish it was easier wish you were better dont wish for less problems wish for more skills dont wish for less challenge wish for more wisdom

two wrongs dont make a right but dont three lefts make a right two wrongs dont make a right but dont two negatives make a positive

you stay safe you love you survive you laugh and cry and struggle and sometimes you fail and sometimes you succeed you push

believe in your infinite potential your only limitations are those you set upon yourself

believe in yourself your abilities and your own potential never let selfdoubt hold you captive you are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for

everything you do is triggered by an emotion of either desire or fear

plato says that the unexamined life is not worth living but what if the examined life turns out to be a clunker as well

see the poor dream all their lives of getting enough to eat and looking like the rich and what do the rich dream of losing weight and looking like the poor

it’s strange how things can change back as suddenly as they changed originally when one thing happens and suddenly things are back to normal

i believe that i am not responsible for the meaningfulness or meaninglessness of life but that i am responsible for what i do with the life ive got

the path to success is to take massive determined action

we have to lie to ourselves to live otherwise wed go crazy

no matter how qualified or deserving we are we will never reach a better life until we can imagine it for ourselves and allow ourselves to have it

you’ll be fine you’re  feeling unsure and lost is part of your path don’t avoid it see what those feelings are showing you and use it take a breath you’ll be okay even if you don’t feel okay all the time

if people make fun of you that probably means youre doing something right

you attract who you are being when you work at being the type of person that you want to attract you attract those kinds of people into your life

if you have kindness in your heart you offer acts of kindness to touch the hearts of others wherever you go—whether they are random or planned kindness becomes a way of life

nostalgia in reverse the longing for yet another strange land grew especially strong in spring

a man travels the world over in search of what he needs and returns home to find it

i love you even if there isn’t any me or any love or even any life i love you

love only grows by sharing you can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others

there’s a really stupid saying when life hands you a lemon make lemonade well i have a better saying when life hands you a lemon shove that lemon up its stupid butt

i need one of those chapter breaks i just want to catch my breath but i have no idea how

if after i die people want to write my biography there is nothing simpler they only need two dates the date of my birth and the date of my death between one and another every day is mine

i simply regard romantic comedies as a subgenre of scifi in which the world created therein has different rules than my regular human world

theres more to life than love

whether we like it or not the one justification for the existence of all religions is death they need death as much as we need bread to eat

it is beautiful it is endless it is full and yet seems empty it hurts us

no matter how much you love someone you still want to have you own way

there are some values that you should never compromise on to stay true to yourself you should be brave to stand up for what you truly believe in even if you stand alone

single is an opportunity to live life on your own terms and not apologize

accidents dont happen to people who take accidents as a personal insult

every challenge you face today makes you stronger tomorrow the challenge of life is intended to make you better not bitter

and meanwhile time goes about its immemorial work of making everyone look and feel like shit

the true mystery of the world is the visible not the invisible

sometimes bad things have to happen before good things can

i think that if the world were a bit more like comiccon it would be a better place

all i am is literature and i am not able or willing to be anything else

people dont always want to be with people it gets tiring

son are you happy

i dont mean to pry

but do you dream of heaven

have you ever wanted to die

one day ill tell my daughter a story about a dark time the dark days before she was born and how her coming was a ray of light we got lost for a while the story will begin but then we found our way

to find out if she really loved me i hooked her up to a lie detector and just as i suspected my machine was broken

i can’t really act the way i want to act or say what i want to say all the time and a lot of times i cover that up with a smile

she cracked a smile so whats your poison

he sighed dramatically and let the truth tumble off his tongue life

ah she said ruefully thatll kill you

the best use of life is love the best expression of love is time the best time to love is now

life doesnt make any sense and we all pretend it does comedys job is to point out that it doesnt make sense and that it doesnt make much difference anyway

there is love of course and then theres life its enemy

this place is a dream only a sleeper considers it real then death comes like dawn and you wake up laughing at what you thought was your grief

desire makes life happen makes it matter makes everything worth it desire is life hunger to see the next sunrise or sunset to touch the one you love to try again

hell would be waking up and wanting nothing he agrees

i dont judge people

it blurs out the center of my attention

my focus

myself

life is a series of surprises and would not be worth taking or keeping if it were not

what we like to think of ourselves and what we really are rarely have much in common

we must all suffer from one of two pains the pain of discipline or the pain of regret the difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons

life is like an onion you peel it off one layer at a time and sometimes you weep

the desire to love someone always exceeds the desire to be loved by someone  thats exactly why we end up loving the person who doesnt deserve that love

you said we all want there to be more than this well theres always more than this theres always something you dont know

everybody know death is inevitably coming but it never fails to catch everybody by surprise everytime one is going

you have come a long way and have won many battles whenever you’re faced with a difficult or challenging situation you’ll overcome it yes you can

like gravity karma is so basic we often dont even notice it

theres a sorrow and pain in everyones life but every now and then theres a ray of light that melts the loneliness in your heart and brings comfort like hot soup and a soft bed

i have stitched life into me like a rare organ

from three women a poem for three voices written

what if im in charge of my own damn light switch

there is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life and beyond which life cannot rise and such is the paradox of living this ecstasy comes when one is most alive and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive

he stood at the window of the empty cafe and watched the activites in the square and he said that it was good that god kept the truths of life from the young as they were starting out or else theyd have no heart to start at all

mathematics expresses values that reflect the cosmos including orderliness balance harmony logic and abstract beauty

discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment

rise and rise again until lambs become lions

but i can hardly sit still i keep fidgeting crossing one leg and then the other i feel like i could throw off sparks or break a windowmaybe rearrange all the furniture

let others lead small lives but not you let others argue over small things but not you let others cry over small hurts but not you let others leave their future in someone elses hands but not you

you wont lag behind because youll have the speed

youll pass the whole gang and youll soon take the lead

wherever you fly youll be best of the best

wherever you go you will top all the rest

except when you dont

because sometimes you wont

right now i had everything i could ask for it wasnt a long list but it was a very satisfying one starting with the love of my life back in my arms

to believe you are magnificent and gradually to discover that you are not magnificent enough labor for one human life

i finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it

if you don’t like the road you’re walking start paving another one

totally without hope one cannot live to live without hope is to cease to live hell is hopelessness it is no accident that above the entrance to dantes hell is the inscription leave behind all hope you who enter here

life consists of two days one for you one against you so when its for you dont be proud or reckless and when its against you be patient for both days are test for you

i am a person who is unhappy with things as they stand we cannot accept the world as it is each day we should wake up foaming at the mouth because of the injustice of things

lately i cant help wanting us

to be like other people

for example if i were a smoker

youd lift a match to the cigarette

just as i put it between my lips

its never been like that

between us none of that

easy chemistry no quick half automatic

flares everything between us

had to be learned

behind my book all my fantasies

of seduction run up

against the rocks

tell me again

why you dont like

sex in the afternoon

no dont tell me

ill never understand you

never understand us americas strangest

loving couple they never

and rarely look at each other

into each others eyes i mean

the way i define happiness is being the creator of your experience choosing to take pleasure in what you have right now regardless of the circumstances while being the best you that you can be

make the most of what you have and keep your standards high never settle for anything less than you deserve or are capable of achieving

life is like a play its not the length but the excellence of the acting that matters

there are no conditions to which a person cannot grow accustomed especially if he sees that everyone around him lives in the same way

perhaps it would be simpler if you just did what youre told and didnt try to understand things

life keeps throwing me lemons because i make the best lemonade

you need just the right amount of fuck the world and the right amount of belief in somethingand you need the right amount of love

your greatest self has been waiting your whole life dont make it wait any longer

it is not so much the major events as the small daytoday decisions that map the course of our living   our lives are in reality the sum total of our seemingly unimportant decisions and of our capacity to live by those decisions

keep your promises and be consistent be the kind of person others can trust

i am almost a hundred years old waiting for the end and thinking about the beginning

there are things i need to tell you but would you listen if i told you how quickly time passes

i know you are unable to imagine this

how would your life be different if…you approached all relationships with authenticity and honesty let today be the day…you dedicate yourself to building relationships on the solid foundation of truth and authenticity

if you believe you can you might if you know you can you will

i know i wrote letters to people with no address on this earth i know that you are dead but i hear you i hear all of you we were here our lives matter

find someone who has a life that you want and figure out how they got it read books pick your role models wisely find out what they did and do it

at  years old i started bleeding with the moon

and beating up boys who dreamed of becoming astronauts

i fought with my knuckles white as stars

and left bruises the shape of salem

there are things we know by heart

and things we dont

at  my friend jen tried to teach me how to blow rings of smoke

id watch the nicotine rising from her lips like halos

but i could never make dying beautiful

the sky didnt fill with colors the night i convinced myself

veins are kite strings you can only cut free

i suppose i love this life

in spite of my clenched fist

i open my palm and my lifelines look like branches from an aspen tree

and there are songbirds perched on the tips of my fingers

and i wonder if beethoven held his breath

the first time his fingers touched the keys

the same way a soldier holds his breath

the first time his finger clicks the trigger

we all have different reasons for forgetting to breathe

but my lungs remember

the day my mother took my hand and placed it on her belly

and told me the symphony beneath was my baby sisters heartbeat

and i knew life would tremble

like the first tear on a prison guards hardened cheek

like a prayer on a dying mans lips

like a vet holding a full bottle of whisky like an empty gun in a war zone…

just take me just take me

sometimes the scales themselves weigh far too much

the heaviness of forever balancing blue sky with red blood

we were all born on days when too many people died in terrible ways

but you still have to call it a birthday

you still have to fall for the prettiest girl on the playground at recess

and hope she knows you can hit a baseball

further than any boy in the whole third grade

and ive been running for home

through the windpipe of a man who sings

while his hands playing washboard with a spoon

where every boarded up window is still painted with the words

were coming back

like a promise to the ocean

that we will always keep moving towards the music

the way basquait slept in a cardboard box to be closer to the rain

beauty catch me on your tongue

the pupils in our eyes were not born to hide beneath their desks

tonight lay us down to rest in the arizona desert

then wake us washing the feet of pregnant women

who climbed across the border with their bellies aimed towards the sun

i know a thousand things louder than a soldiers gun

i know the heartbeat of his mother

dont cover your ears love

dont cover your ears life

there is a boy writing poems in central park

and as he writes he moves

and his bones become the bars of mandelas jail cell stretching apart

and there are men playing chess in the december cold

who cant tell if the breath rising from the board

is their opponents or their own

and theres a woman on the stairwell of the subway

swearing she can hear niagara falls from her rooftop in brooklyn

and im remembering how niagara falls is a city overrun

with strip malls and traffic and vendors

and one incredibly brave river that makes it all worth it

yall i know this world is far from perfect

i am not the type to mistake a streetlight for the moon

i know our wounds are deep as the atlantic

but every ocean has a shoreline

and every shoreline has a tide

that is constantly returning

to wake the songbirds in our hands

to wake the music in our bones

to place one fearless kiss on the mouth of that brave river

that has to run through the center of our hearts

to find its way home

there are no second chances in life except to feel remorse

i need you to be happy i need one of us to be happy

the spiritual life does not remove us from the world but leads us deeper into it

life is a spark between two identical voids the darkness before birth and the one after death

the only real limitation on your abilities is the level of your desires if you

want it badly enough there are no limits on what you can achieve

one of the best ways to influence people is to make them feel important most people enjoy those rare moments when others make them feel important it is one of the deepest human desires

the past can teach us nurture us but it cannot sustain us the essence of life is change and we must move ever forward or the soul will wither and die

nothing is built on stone all is built on sand but we must build as if the sand were stone

if you want something you can have it but only if you want everything that goes with it including all the hard work and the despair and only if youre willing to risk failure

i believe the stars align so souls can find one another whether they are meant to be souls in love or souls in life remains to be seen

we can regard our life as a uselessly disturbing episode in the blissful repose of nothingness

fear what has a man to do with fear chance rules our lives and the future is all unknown best live as we may from day to day

live all you can its a mistake not to it doesnt matter what you do in particular so long as you have had your life if you havent had that what have you had

you say freak i say unique

dance above the surface of the world let your thoughts lift you into creativity that is not hampered by opinion

there is no standard normal normal is subjective there are seven billion versions of normal on this planet

if youre gonna burn a bridge behind you make sure youve crossed it first

i realize that life is risks it’s acknowledging the past but looking forward it’s taking a chance that we will

make mistakes but believing that we all deserve to be forgiven

rock n roll is not red carpets and myspace friends rocknroll is dangerous and should piss people off

let your life lightly dance on the edges of

time like dew on the tip of a leaf

opening up to the wrong person is like putting ammo in their hands

i want to see beauty in the ugly in the sink in the suffering in the daily in all the days before i die the moments before i sleep

the young man came to the old man seeking counsel

how badly is it broken

its in a million little pieces

im afraid i cant help you

why

theres nothing you can do

why

it cant be fixed

why

its broken beyond repair its in a million little pieces

life has but one true charm the charm of the game but what if we’re indifferent to whether we win or lose

while theres life theres hope

life is only precious because it ends kid take it from a god you mortals dont know how lucky you are

having perfected our disguise we spend our lives searching for someone we don’t fool

our most significant opportunities will be found in times of greatest difficulty

instead of focusing on how much you can accomplish focus on how much you can absolutely love what you’re doing

i wonder if ill ever have to decide which is worse life as were living or no life at all

life is so constructed that the event does not cannot will not match the expectation

love doesnt give you very many choices when you love someone you just want to be with them if they break your heart you will still love them because hearts are easy to break and though love is tender and sometimes fragile love isnt

love addicts you to its feeling you never ever want to lose that feeling sometimes the fear of losing love drives people to do crazy things like buy a plane ticket make a phone call run out of a class cry write laugh

because when you love someone you really love them you give them your whole heart you trust them you never want to be away from them sometimes you dont even need their words you just need them there

love is such an amazing thing and too many people take it for granted if youre in love dont let it go dont you dare let it go

autobiography begins with a sense of being alone it is an orphan form

he said that we belonged together because he was born with a flower and i was born with a butterfly and that flowers and butterflies need each other for survival

you know life fractures us all into little pieces it harms us but its how we glue those fractures back together that make us stronger

i used to wonder if it was gods plan that i should be alone for so much of my life but i found peace i found happiness within people and the world

you dont put your life into your books you find it there

i want to keep my dreams even bad ones because without them i might have nothing all night long

do nothing and nothing happens life is about decisions you either make them or theyre made for you but you cant avoid them

most of what matters in our lives takes place in our absence

everyday is a bank account and time is our currency no one is rich no one is poor weve got  hours each

you once told me

you wanted to find

yourself in the world

and i told you to

to discover the world

within you

you once told me

you wanted to save

the world from all its wars

and i told you to

first save yourself

from the world

and all the wars

you put yourself

through

apply within by suzy kassem

how ridiculous and how strange to be surprised at anything which happens in life

life is short focus on what really matters most you should change your priorities over time

i dont want to live i want to love first and live incidentally

if a man is to live he must be all alive body soul mind heart spirit

because im selfish im a coward im the kind of girl who when she might actually be of use would run to stay alive and leave those who couldnt follow to suffer and die

real life is only ever just real life messy what it means depends on how you look at it the only thing you’ve got to do is find a way to live there

because if youve found meaning in your life you dont want to go back you want to go forward

to me history ought to be a source of pleasure it isnt just part of our civic responsibility to me its an enlargement of the experience of being alive just the way literature or art or music is

the title always comes last neh  jefferson lecturer interview profile

i was lost yesterday i am found today and i will be forgotten tomorrow

end no the journey doesnt end here death is just another path one that we all must take

if you can spend a perfectly useless afternoon in a perfectly useless manner you have learned how to live

besides the noble art of getting things done there is the noble art of leaving things undone the wisdom of life consists in the elimination of nonessentials

the act of taking the first step is what separates the winners from the losers

distance sometimes lets you know who is worth keeping and who is worth letting go

i know there is no straight road

no straight road in this world

only a giant labyrinth

sometimes you need a little crisis to get your adrenaline flowing and help you realize your potential

doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the mext moment

i knew it like destiny and at the same time i knew it as choice

it’s too bad if a heart lacks fire

and is deprived of the light

the day on which you are

is the most wasted day of your life

dont wake me for the end of the world unless it has very good special effects

theres no benchmark for how lifes supposed to happen there is no ideal world for you to wait around for the world is always just what it is now its up to you how you respond to it

she didnt read books so she didnt know that she was the world and the heavens boiled down to a drop

too late i found you cant wait to become perfect you got to go out and fall down and get up with everybody else

hate is nothing when weighed against survival valentine

all any of us wanted really was to know that we counted that someone elses life would not have been as rich without us here

selfconsciousness is the enemy of all art be it acting writing painting or living itself which is the greatest art of all

theres a race of men that dont fit in

a race that cant sit still

so they break the hearts of kith and kin and they roam the world at will

they range the field and rove the flood

and they climb the mountains crest theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood

and they dont know how to rest

the world is not a pleasant place to be without someone to hold and be held by

you wanted to feel alive right it doesnt matter if youre monster or human living hurts

to leave after all was not the same as being left

when all else fails theres always delusion

i am afraid to show you who i really am because if i show you who i really am you might not like itand thats all i got

life is a sexually transmitted disease and the mortality rate is one hundred percent

if you dont learn to laugh at life itll surely kill you that i know

when i grow up i want to be an inventor first i will invent a time machine then ill come back to yesterday and take myself to tomorrow and skip this dumb assignment

even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness

before i can tell my life what i want to do with it i must listen to my life telling me who i am

the world is  days as for yesterday it has vanished along with all that was in it as for tomorrow you may never see it as for today it is yours so work on it

you will receive everything you need when you stop asking for what you do not need

as usual goodness hardly puts up a fight

change your life today dont gamble on the future act now without delay

you rely too much on brain the brain is the most overrated organ

in the short term it would make me happy to go play outside in the long term it would make me happier to do well at school and become successful but in the very long term i know which will make better memories

people who say that yesterday was better than today are ultimately devaluing their own existence

there are times in our lives when we have to realize our past is precisely what it is and we cannot change it but we can change the story we tell ourselves about it and by doing that we can change the future

but more than that he taught me something about good nature it is enough to be benign to be gentle to be funny to be kind

this is the strangest life i have ever known

love doesn’t have to be on valentine’s day it doesn’t have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirtythree or fiftynine it doesn’t have to conform to whatever is usual it doesn’t have to be kismet at once or rhapsody by the third day

it just has to be in time in place in spirt

it just has to be

the best stories dont come from good vs bad but good vs good

ive found that luck is quite predictable if you want more luck take more

chances be more active show up more often

if you cannot find peace within yourself you will never find it anywhere else

my hope still is to leave the world a bit better than when i got here

only after disaster can we be resurrected

we all make choices but in the end our choices make us

really he asked pixiehaired gorgeous girl dislikes authority and cant help but fall for a boy she knows is trouble its your autobiography so far as i can tell

his every syllable flirted honestly he kind of turned me on i didnt even know that guys could turn me on  not like in real life

how easy it was to capitalize on a person’s own bent for selfdestruction how simple to nudge them into nonbeing then to stand back and shrug and agree that it had been the inevitable result of a chaotic catastrophic life

anyone who isnt embarrassed of who they were last year probably isnt learning enough

love yourself forgive yourself be true to yourself how you treat yourself sets the standard for how others will treat you

i’m sort of… coming off a bad relationship

when did it end

slightly before it started

those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it george santayana

ive got news for mr santayana were doomed to repeat the past no matter what thats what it is to be alive

in one drop of water are found all the secrets of all the oceans in one aspect of you are found all the aspects of existence

he found himself understanding the wearisomeness of this life where every path was an improvisation and a considerable part of ones waking life was spent watching ones feet

all those who try to unveil the mysteries always have tragic lives at the end they are always punished

life is at its best when everything has fallen out of place and you decide that youre going to fight to get them right not when everything is going your way and everyone is praising you

one of the tragic things i know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living we are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon  instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today

how much sweeter life would be if it all happened in reverse if after decades of disappointments you finally arrived at an age when you had conceded nothing when everything was possible

books can truly change our lives the lives of those who read them the lives of those who write them readers and writers alike discover things they never knew about the world and about themselves

the world is moving so fast these days that the man who says it cant be done is generally interrupted by someone doing it

tried living in the real world instead of a shell but i was bored before i even began

come clean with a child heart

laugh as peaches in the summer wind

let rain on a house roof be a song

let the writing on your face

be a smell of apple orchards on late june

everything you want in life is a relationship away

each day is born with a sunrise

and ends in a sunset the same way we

open our eyes to see the light

and close them to hear the dark

you have no control over

how your story begins or ends

but by now you should know that

all things have an ending

every spark returns to darkness

every sound returns to silence

and every flower returns to sleep

with the earth

the journey of the sun

and moon is predictable

but yours

is your ultimate

create your own miracles do what you think you cannot do

and all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees

and changing leaves

people are the most difficult thing in the world to change

in wisdom gathered over time i have found that every experience is a form of exploration

dont forget a persons greatest emotional need is to feel appreciated

and you drink a little too much and try a little too hard and you go home to a cold bed and think that was fine and your life is a long line of fine

all paths are present always and we can but choose among them

there are several ways to react to being lost one is to panic this was usually valentinas first impulse another is to abandon yourself to lostness to allow the fact that youve misplaced yourself to change the way you experience the world

whatever happens to your body your soul will survive untouched

she supposed they were imperfections those marks but they didnt feel that way to her they were a history cut into his body the map of a life of endless war

the life you have left is a gift cherish it enjoy it now to the fullest do what matters now

life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship

muscles aching to work minds aching to create  this is man

those who have failed to work toward the truth have missed the purpose of living

if you fuel your journey on the opinions of others you are going to run out of gas

whatever you believe with feeling becomes your reality

rule your mind or it will rule you

he was unheeded happy and near to the wild heart of life he was alone and young and wilful and wildhearted alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey sunlight

what it means to be authentic

to be more concerned with truth than opinions

to be sincere and not pretend

to be free from hypocrisy walk your talk

to know who you are and to be that person

to not fear others seeing your vulnerabilities

being confident to walk away from situations where you cant be yourself

being awake to your own feelings

being free from others opinions of you

accepting and loving yourself

sometimes letting go is simply changing the labels you place on an event looking at the same event with fresh eyes

there isnt enough of anything

as long as we live but at intervals

a sweetness appears and given a chance

i want you i want you so badly i can’t stand it when you left it felt like the world got darker like i couldn’t truly see anything couldn’t feel anything

i met a boy whose eyes showed me that the past present and future were all the same thing

as you grow up always tell the truth do no harm to others and dont think you are the most important being on earth rich or poor you then can look anyone in the eye and say im probably no better than you but im certainly your equal

and its fun when life is just flatout boring

keep your mind open the meaning of things lies in how people perceive them the same thing could mean different meanings to the same people at different times

you cant have living without dying so you cant call it living what we got we just are we just be like rocks beside the road

i will continue my path but i will keep a memory always

life is a succesion of lessons which must be lived to be understood

what a waste my life would be without all the beautiful mistakes ive made

what kind of life can you have in a house without books

try patting them on the back or shoulder and telling them everything is going to be fine lots of times when girls cry they dont want you to fix the problem they just want to be consoled

it frightens me the awful truth of how sweet life can be

ive been embarrassing myself since about birth

you see i kept asking myself then why am i so stupid that if others are stupid—and i know they are—yet i wont be wiser

if you havent confidence in self you are twice defeated in the race of life with confidence you have won even before you have started

no human should mislead another by promising them something they know to be untrue

it was when i stopped searching for home within others and lifted the foundations of home within myself i found there were no roots more intimate than those between a mind and body that have decided to be whole

the cradle rocks above an abyss and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness

i dont know how i look but i know how i feel young goofy infinite

life swings like a pendulum backward and forward between pain and boredom

each new day is a blank page in the diary of your life the secret of success is in turning that diary into the best story you possibly can

that is the hardest thing of all it is much harder to judge yourself than to judge others if you succeed in judging yourself its because youre truly a wise man

i always knew on some level that i wouldnt live long its simply not written in my stars

the heart makes its choices without weighing the consequences it doesnt look ahead to the lonely nights that follow

thats how it is on this bitch of an earth

the future is meant for those who are willing to let go of the worst parts of the past when you cannot take two steps without turning around to inspect your footsteps you are getting nowhere fast

life is the farce we are all forced to endure

atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what they were interested in not about what you were interested in

dont leave it all unsaid

somewhere in the wasteland of your head

some people insist that mediocre is better than best they delight in clipping wings because they themselves cant fly they despise brains because they have none

life is life you choose to live it or you do not

the friends you make in college are friends youll have for life even if you dont talk for years at a time

the worst thing he told me

is bitterness people end up so

in the haunted house of life art is the only stair that doesnt creak

never stop smiling not even when youre sad someone might fall in love with your smile

i knew that in the silence that followed that anything could happen here it might be too late again i might have missed my chance but i would at least know i tried that i took my heart and extended my hand whatever the outcome

i began to understand that suffering and disappointments and melancholy are there not to vex us or cheapen us or deprive us of our dignity but to mature and transfigure us

life is a winking light in the darkness

to succeed in life you need three things a wishbone a backbone and a funnybone

it’s always about timing if it’s too soon no one understands if it’s too late everyone’s forgotten

dead people can be our heroes because they cant disappoint us later they only improve over time as we forget more and more about them

its paradoxical that the idea of living a long life appeals to everyone but the idea of getting old doesnt appeal to anyone

isnt it strange that i know youd risk your life to save mine but i dont even know what your favorite color is

quietly endure silently suffer and patiently wait

in my many years i have come to a conclusion that one useless man is a shame two is a law firm and three or more is a congress

what made me run away was doubtless not so much the fear of settling down but of settling down permanently in something ugly

listen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth — look at the dying man’s struggle at his last extremity and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment

look everyone talks about the unknown like its some big scary thing but its the familiar thats always bothered me its heavy builds up around you like rocks until its walls and a ceiling and a cell

i feel no need for any other faith than my faith in the kindness of human beings i am so absorbed in the wonder of earth and the life upon it that i cannot think of heaven and angels

well i can understand how you feel you worked hard studying for the spelling bee and i suppose you feel you let everyone down and you made a fool of yourself and everything but did you notice something charlie brown

whats that

the world didnt come to an end

so shut up live travel adventure bless and dont be sorry

the trick  is to find the balance between the bright colors of humor and the serious issues of identity selfloathing and the possibility for intimacy and love when it seems no longer possible or sadder yet no longer necessary

life is fragile and temporary the faces of today quickly become the faces of the past sorrow pain and anger it all fades

except love love is forever and there after even when weve fallen to our graves

hurt is a part of life to be honest i think hurt is a part of happiness that our definition of happiness has gotten very narrow lately very nervous a little afraid of this brawling fabulous unpredictable world

people will always have opinions about your decision because theyre not courageous enough to take action on their opinion

the past can not be cured

per aspera ad astra papa i whispered through hardship to the stars

the best way to prepare for life is to begin to live

fuck it thats really the attitude that keeps a family together its not we love each other its just fuck it man

life is such a glorious trauma is it not

everyone thinks that courage is about facing death without flinching but almost anyone can do that almost anyone can hold their breath and not scream for as long as it takes to die

true courage is about facing life without flinching i dont mean the times when the right path is hard but glorious at the end im talking about enduring the boredom the messiness and the inconvenience of doing what is right

suspect each moment for it is a thief tiptoeing away with more than it brings

that woman doesnt have the sense god gave a retarded flea

its much easier to not know things sometimes things change and friends leave and life doesnt stop for anybody

life did not stop and one had to live

your entire sense of selfworth is predicated upon your belief that you matter that you matter to the universe but you dont because we are the ants

im always happy when im surrounded by water i think im a mermaid or i was a mermaid

the ocean makes me feel really small and it makes me put my whole life into perspective… it humbles you and makes you feel almost like you’ve been baptized i feel born again when i get out of the ocean

the world is wide and i will not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum

well sometimes i worry that my whole life will be based about whats comfortable and easy ill care too much about what makes me feel good to ever really reach for anything and then i worry that even if i do i wont succeed

i want to drag knives over my skin just to feel something other than shame but im not even brave enough for that

not forever does the bulbul sing

not forever lasts the spring

nor ever blossom the flowers

not forever reigneth joy

sets the sun on days of bliss

friendships not forever last

they know not life who know not this

but what is life if you dont live it

my formula for life is very simple in the morning wake up at night go to sleep in between i try and occupy myself as best i can

the life of the enemy  whoever lives for the sake of combating an enemy has an interest in the enemys staying alive

when nothing is sure everything is possible

whoever said that the past isnt dead had it backward its the future thats already dead already played out

the world’s greatest achievers have been those who have always stayed focussed on their goals and have been consistent in their efforts

if you want to be a new man you have to stay in new places and do new things with people who never knew you before if you go back to the same old ways what else can you be but the same old person

every time i thought i was being rejected from something good i was actually being redirected to something better

i always thought that life was about standing your ground no matter how strong the current was but going with the flow isnt so bad after all as long as it takes you forward

dogs are great bad dogs if you can really call them that are perhaps the greatest of them all

youll forget it when youre dead and so will i when im dead im going to forget everything–and i advise you to do the same

i’m not a bad person i haven’t killed anyone i rarely lie i don’t kick little puppies so why do people look at me as if the world would be a better place without me

life is a moderately good play with a badly written third act

keep your friends close but your enemies closer

i need to stop fantasizing about running away to some other life and start figuring out the one i have

bring something incomprehensible into the world

like madness is the glory of this life

i loved you long before you loved me its the only thing i have you beat at and ill bring it up every chance i get

what i am telling you before you begin my story is this  two things i crave truth and i lie

spend the afternoon you cant take it with you

it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can stop him from lynching me and i think thats pretty important

you cant do anything about the length of your life but you can do something about its width and depth

oh something is there waiting for me perhaps someday the revelation will burst in upon me and i will see the other side of this monumental grotesque joke and then ill laugh and then ill know what life is

the river is everywhere

life is no brief candle to me it is a sort of splendid torch which i have got a hold of for the moment and i want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations

your days are numbered use them to throw open the windows of your soul to the sun if you do not the sun will soon set and you with it

slow down and enjoy life its not only the scenery you miss by going too fast  you also miss the sense of where you are going and why

never give up on what you really want to do the person with big dreams is more powerful than one with all the facts

it is a joy to be hidden and disaster not to be found

there are no classes in life for beginners right away you are always asked to deal with what is most difficult

but i always liked sidepaths little dark backalleys behind the main road there one finds adventures and surprises and precious metal in the dirt

some people are born with tornadoes in their lives but constellations in their eyes other people are born with stars at their feet but their souls are lost at sea

it is said that power corrupts but actually its more true that power attracts the corruptible the sane are usually attracted by other things than power

tomorrow belongs to those who can hear it coming

sometimes its better to stop trying to make sense of things life isnt clear cut there are always gray areas

i said somebody should do something about that then i realized i am somebody

your hand can seize today but not tomorrow and thoughts of your tomorrow are nothing but desire don’t waste this breath if your heart isn’t crazy since the rest of your life won’t last forever

were not words henry were people

words are how others define us but we can define ourselves any way we choose

or rather let us be more simple and less vain

every last minute of my life has been preordained and im sick and tired of it

how this feels is im just another task in gods daily planner the italian renaissance penciled in for right after the dark ages

through all of living have much joy and laughter life is to be enjoyed not just endured

every man should lose a battle in his youth so he does not lose a war when he is old

the way is not in the sky the way is in the heart

you must learn to forgive a man when hes in love hes always a nuisance

in life there are no mistakes only lessons

you must learn to know the difference between tales and the truth my liza she would say fairy tales have a habit of ending too soon they never show what happens afterwards when the prince and princess ride off the page

the demon that you can swallow gives you its power and the greater life’s pain the greater life’s reply

it is a very natural human trait to destroy that which frightens us

we cannot after all judge a biography by its length by the number of pages in it we must judge by the richness of the contentssometimes the unfinisheds are among the most beautiful symphonies

in heaven an angel is no one in particular

a very wise man once told me that you cant look backyou just have to put the past behind you and find something better in your future

given that we can live only a small part of what there is in us  what happens with the rest

above all i have been a sentient being a thinking animal on this beautiful planet and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure

are those real islands asked the young prince

of course they are real islands said the man in evening dress

and those strange and troubling creatures

they are all genuine and authentic princesses

then god must exist cried the prince

i am god replied the man in full evening dress with a bow

the young prince returned home as quickly as he could

so you are back said the father the king

i have seen islands i have seen princesses i have seen god said the prince reproachfully

the king was unmoved

neither real islands nor real princesses i have seen god said the prince reproachfully

the king was unmoved

neither real islands nor real princesses nor a real god exist

i saw them

tell me how god was dressed

were the sleeves of his coat rolled back

the prince remembered that they had been the king smiled

that is the uniform of a magician you have been deceived

at this the prince returned to the next land and went to the same shore where once again he came upon the man in full evening dress

my father the king has told me who you are said the young prince indignantly you deceived me last time but not again now i know that those are not real islands and real princesses because you are a magician

the man on the shore smiled

it is you who are deceived my boy in your fathers kingdom there are many islands and many princesses but you are under your fathers spell so you cannot see them

the prince pensively returned home when he saw his father he looked him in the eyes

father is it true that you are not a real king but only a magician

the king smiled and rolled back his sleeves

yes my son i am only a magician

then the man on the shore was god

the man on the shore was another magician

i must know the real truth the truth beyond magic

there is no truth beyond magic said the king

the prince was full of sadness

he said i will kill myself

the king by magic caused death to appear death stood in the door and beckoned to the prince the prince shuddered he remembered the beautiful but unreal islands and the unreal but beautiful princesses

very well he said i can bear it

you see my son said the king you too now begin to be a magician

to be alive is to be missing

everything is funnier in retrospect funnier and prettier and cooler you can laugh at anything from far enough away

i once had a dreams of becoming a beautiful poet but upon an unfortunate series of events some of those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky that i wished on over and over again sparkling and broken

but i didnt really mind because i knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is

youre always with yourself so you might as well enjoy the company

ten long trips around the sun since i last saw that smile but only joy and thankfulness that on a tiny world in the vastness for a couple of moments in the immensity of time we were one

they both listened silently to the water which to them was not just water but the voice of life the voice of being the voice of perpetual becoming

i never could bear the idea of anyones expecting something from me it

always made me want to do just the opposite

dreams are hopeful because they exist as pure possibility unlike memories which are fossils long dead and buried deep

your heart’s strength is measured by how hard it holds on your self worth and faith is measured by finally letting go however your peace is measured by how long you don’t look back

if one has no sense of humor one is in trouble

no matter what your history has been your destiny is what you create today what are you going to create

and you know theres less charm in life when you think about deathbut its more peaceful

the spirit of a man is constructed out of his choices

the life of every individual viewed as a whole and in general and when only its most significant features are emphasized is really a tragedy but gone through in detail it has the character of a comedy

youd think what if i make a mistake today ill regret it i don’t believe in regret i feel everything leads us to where we are and we have to just jump forward mean well commit and just see what happens

the true miracle lies in our eagerness to allow appreciate and honor the uniqueness and freedom of each sentient being to sing the song of their heart

grace is what picks me up and lifts my wings high above and i fly grace always conquers be graceful in everything in anger in sadness in joy in kindness in unkindness retain grace with you

not in his speech not in his thoughts i see his greatness only in his actions in his life

but instead of spending our lives running towards our dreams we are often running away from a fear of failure or a fear of criticism

people see stories everywherewe take random events and we put them together in a pattern so we can comfort ourselves with a story no matter how much it obviously isnt truewe have to lie to ourselves to live otherwise wed go crazy

people soon get tired of things that arent boring but not of what is boring

regrets are about decisions that you know you should have done different

for what its worth i think happiness is a fleeting condition not a permanent state of goddamn mind ive learned that if you chase after moments of bliss here and there sometimes those moments will sustain you through the shit

if you are not the hero of your own story then youre missing the whole point of your humanity

memory can make a thing seem to have been much more than it was

everybodys damaged by something

for those who believe no proof is necessary for those who dont believe no proof is possible

my life has been one great big joke

a dance thats walked

a song thats spoke

i laugh so hard i almost choke

when i think about myself

if youre afraid of everyone leaving you what do you do

make them stay

and if you cant do that or dont know how to

ellie shrugged i dont know

yes you do in fact youve done it you leave first coop said so you dont have to watch them walk away

when i look at my old pictures all i can see is what i used to be but am no longer i think what i can see is what i am not

a lot of the conflict you have in your life exists simply because youre not living in alignment youre not be being true to yourself

all our knowledge has its origin in our perceptions

its not always easy being her daughter

i think she said sometimes its hard no matter whose daughter you are

its funny no matter how hard you try you cant close your heart forever and the minute you open it up you never know whats going to come in but when it does you just have to go for it because if you dont theres not point in being here

everyone is lonely we have to remember that life is to be lived one day at a time you cannot worry about the past or future happiness is in the now

every single time you help somebody stand up you are helping humanity rise

find ecstasy in life the mere sense of living is joy enough

how would your life be different if…you stopped validating your victim mentality let today be the day…you shake off your selfdefeating drama and embrace your innate ability to recover and achieve

i know im not going to be in your head all the time but once you know me ill be forever in your heart

a wind that blows aimlessly is no good to anyone

i had a dream about you last night the champagne was nonalcoholic you didnt notice and laughed at my jokes anyway

crying does not indicate that you are weak since birth it has always been a sign that you are alive

you couldnt erase everything that caused you pain with recollectionevery memory was valuable even the bad ones

i just want to do something that matters or be something that matters i just want to matter

even a snail will eventually reach its destination

the others in the dorm thought i wanted to be a writer because i was always alone with a book but i had no such ambition there was nothing i wanted to be

you will have to make up for the smallness of your size by your courage and selfless devotion to duty for it is not life that matters but the courage fortitude and determination you bring to it

leaders are limited by their vision rather than by their abilities

lifes pain you just have to get over as much of it as you can

life is ours to be spent not to

be saved

because there was a hunger in me to see everything and do everything i wanted to be everyone i saw i wasnt enough for me can you understand that

in a womans womb

to make the world better

many people pray to be kept out of unexpected problems

some people pray to be able to confront and overcome them

it’s not so much the journey that’s important as is the way that we treat those we encounter and those around us along the way

what keeps life fascinating is the constant creativity of the soul

leonard asks me if theres anything i need to know before he dies i think about it for a minute turn to him say whats the meaning of life leonard he laughs says thats an easy one my son its whatever you want it to be

there are two primary choices in life to accept conditions as they exist or accept the responsibility for changing them

a quitter never winsanda winner never quits

life sucks and then you die

yeah i should be so lucky

the ability to discipline yourself to delay gratification in the short term in order to enjoy greater rewards in the long term is the indispensable prerequisite for success

you are always a little bit wrong

live authentically why would you continue to compromise something thats beautiful to create something that is fake

when you are living the best version of yourself you inspire others to live the best versions of themselves

i am still in the land of the dying i shall be in the land of the living soon his last words

the shortness of life so often lamented may be the best thing about it

everything has boundaries the same holds true with thought you shouldnt fear boundaries but you should not be afraid of destroying them thats what is most important if you want to be free respect for and exasperation with boundaries

me i want to bloody kick this moronic bloody world in the bloody teeth over and over till it bloody understands that not hurting people is ten bloody thousand times more bloody important than being right

when was it i realized that on this truly dark and solitary path we all walk the only way we can light is our own although i was raised with love i was always lonely

someday without fail everyone will disappear scattered into the blackness of time

a celibate clergy is an especially good idea because it tends to suppress any hereditary propensity toward fanaticism

i cant seem to be a pessimist long enough to overlook the possibility of things being overwhelmingly good

it is your responsibility to find fault with me it is mine to hear you out but dont expect me to change

he asked where are you today right now

where is the earth

in the solar system third planet from the sun the sun is a small star in the milky way galaxy all right

and where socrates smiled is the universe

the universe is well there are theories about how its shaped

thats not what i asked where is it

i dont know  how can i answer that

my ignorance is based on this understanding your understanding is based on ignorance this is why i am a humorous fool and you are a serious jackass

i feel like a big faker because ive been putting my life back together and nobody knows

each day is gods gift to you what you do with it is your gift to him

integrity is doing what is right and truthful and doing as you say you would do

scars show us where we have been they do not dictate where we are going

poor creatures what did we do to you with all our schemes and plans

life makes fools of all of us sooner or later but keep your sense of humor and youll at least be able to take your humiliations with some measure of grace in the end you know its our own expectations that crush us

we are on strike we the men of the mind

life has become the future every moment of your life is lived for the future

until we can receive with an open heart we are never really giving with an open heart

i saw a star i reached for it i missed so i accepted the sky

life is much simpler if you don’t notice anything

life is grace sleep is forgiveness the night absolves darkness wipes the slate clean not spotless to be sure but clean enough for another days chalking

stop asking god to bless what youre doing find out what gods doing its already blessed

life always begins with one step outside of your comfort zone

being born is like being kidnapped and then sold into slavery

that i shall love always

that love is life

and life hath immortality

the reason why the universe is eternal is that it does not live for itself it gives life to others as it transforms

what had human beings become did war make us evil or just activate an evil already lurking within us

im as cruel as life as cruel as love

people are not lazy they simply have impotent goalsthat isgoals that do not inspire them

the main facts in human life are five birth food sleep love and death

always choose the future over the past what do we do now

slowly with many lost days i come back to life

you can play it safe and i wouldnt blame you for it you can continue as youve been doing and youll survive but is that what you want is that enough

i never approve or disapprove of anything now it is an absurd attitude to take towards life

life sucks then you die then it sucks again

do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes

look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much more valuable than they

who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life

therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own

im not sure if theres one right place im supposed to be he said but i know a couple of wrong places id give a second try in a heartbeat

war is not for winning masha sighed koschei reading the tracks of supply lines of pincer strategies over her shoulder it is for surviving

for someone like myself in whom the ability to trust others is so cracked and broken that i am wretchedly timid and am forever trying to read the expression on peoples faces

real life is messy inconsistent and its seldom when anything ever really gets resolved its taken me a long time to realize that

nobody is exempt from the trials of life but everyone can always find something positive in everything even in the worst of times

to live greatly we must develop the capacity to face trouble with courage disappointment with cheerfulness and triumph with humility

shock is a merciful condition it allows you to get through disaster with a necessary distance between you and your feelings

it is always better

to avenge dear ones than to indulge in mourning

for every one of us living in this world

means waiting for our end let whoever can

win glory before death when a warrior is gone

that will be his best and only bulwark

the mind is a wonderful servant but a terrible master

until death it is all life

because never in my life have i ever been picked when there was another alternative

thats most interesting but i was no more a mindreader then than today i

was weeping for an altogether different reason when i watched you dancing that day i saw something else i saw a new world coming rapidly more

scientific efficient yes more cures for the old sicknesses very good but a

harsh cruel world and i saw a little girl her eyes tightly closed holding to her breast the old kind world one that she knew in her heart could not

remain and she was holding it and pleading never to let her go that is what i saw it wasnt really you what you were doing i know that but i saw you and it broke my heart and ive never forgotten

i dont expect life to make sense he said after a few moments but it could certainly be pleasant if it would stop kicking us in the balls

a persons rightful due is to be treated as an object of love not as an object for use

like a running blaze on a plain like a flash of lightning in the clouds we live in the flicker

i can learn to live with guilt i dont care about being good

love is forever if it wasnt it wouldnt be love the world is beautiful if it wasnt it wouldnt be the world

we all give up great expectations along the way

sure it could get rough sometimes but life wasnt a hollywood movie shit happened you fought you screamed and somehow you worked like hell to get out the other side still intact

they say that not matter how old you become when you are with your siblings you revert back to childhood

you didnt just cheat on me you cheated on us you didnt just break my heart you broke our future

i have to live if i want to be remembered

dont be afraid of the shadows that only means theres a light nearby

all the stuff you can’t wait to get away from until it’s not there anymore and then you miss it like crazy

the level of success you achieve will be in direct proportion to the depth of your commitment

life is full of beauty notice it notice the bumble bee the small child and the smiling faces smell the rain and feel the wind live your life to the fullest potential and fight for your dreams

thats the problem with memories you can visit them but you cant live in them

vital lives are about action you cant feel warmth unless you create it cant feel delight until you play cant know serendipity unless you risk

its amazing how quickly nature consumes human places after we turn our backs on them life is a hungry thing

it always sound scarier when a hollerer talk soft

when life doesnt meet your expectations it was important to take it with grace

there are times i wish i were invisible which is silly since i do everything i can to stand out

the longer we live the more weight we carry in our hearts

hope is not a feeling of certainty that everything ends well hope is just a feeling that life and work have a meaning

no matter what happened yesterday it is insignificant when compared to what lies within the core of your being today

to become vegetarian is to step into the stream which leads to nirvana

if we dont change we dont grow if we dont grow we arent really living

i should have learned this she thought i wanted to learn fire and pain but i should have learned people

birthdays could be such a bummer when you were older than the country you lived in

timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty

it is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped

be curious about the world in which you live look things up chase down every reference go deeper than anybody elsethats how youll get ahead

after a long labored sigh i said she was really happy when i got there i’m pretty sure she was suicidal when i left

you do have that effect on people

one of the best ways to influence people is to make those around you feel important

i had a dream about you last night you were holding a pine cone and introducing him as gerald

it’s life you don’t figure it out you just climb up on the beast and ride

do not become someone else just because you are hurt be who you are  smile it may solve all problems you have got

i had forgotten how much light there is in the world till you gave it back to me

oh for the years i have not lived but only dreamed of living

it takes as much courage to have tried and failed as it does to have tried and succeded

something amazing happens when youre in love and dont give a damn about what day it is anymore

you cant regret the life you didnt lead

if you dont know what you want youll never find it

if you dont know what you deserve youll always settle for less

you will wander aimlessly uncomfortably numb in your comfort zone wondering how life has ended up here

life starts now live love laugh and let your light shine

every path is the right path everything couldve been anything else﻿ and it would have just as much meaning

theres two kinds of womenthose you write poems about and those you dont

decide what you want to be

pay the price

and be what you want to be

love changes things hope allows us to endure until the change arrives

people say i make strange choices but they’re not strange for me my sickness is that i’m fascinated by human behavior by what’s underneath the surface by the worlds inside people

you just have to go after what you want and if it doesnt want you back then so be it it doesnt deserve you anyways

life was not longer something to endure but to live

there are two ways to live a life either forget everything or remember nothing

here was peace she pulled in her horizon like a great fishnet pulled it from around the waist of the world and draped it over her shoulder so much of life in its meshes she called in her soul to come and see

the only certainty life contains is death

please give your

bodies and your

to

who

deserve them

there is

no way

the

you would bring

and

i wish you

and

out

but not

you

we feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered the problems of life have still not been touched at all

all good childrens stories are the same young creature breaks rules has incredible adventure then returns home with the knowledge that aforementioned rules are there for a reason

of course the actual message to the careful reader is break rules as often as you can because who the hell doesnt want to have an adventure

this new day has greeted us with no rules unconditional opportunity do not dilute the power of this new day with the hardship of yesterday greet this day the way it has greeted you with open arms and endless possibility

holding a grudge  harboring angerresentment is poison to the soul get even with peoplebut not those who have hurt us forget them instead get even with those who have helped us

i will never deny that life isnt fair it seems as though when a woman leaves a man she is strong and independent but when a man leaves a woman he is a pig and a jerk

if you think something is missing in your life it is probably you

for one day there will be nothing left yet we will have something me

i tried to wait for my life to begin something has to happen like an amazing boy i know hes out there i just have to find him

the life so short the craft so long to learn

you have every right to a beautiful life

so i learned two things that night and the next day from him the perfection of a moment and the fleeting nature of it

thats not a bad wordhate and war are bad words but fuck isnt

dont let your luggage define your travels each life unravels differently

it is our wounds that create in us a desire to reach for miracles the fulfillment of such miracles depends on whether we let our wounds pull us down or lift us up towards our dreams

the ego relies on the familiar it is reluctant to experience the unknown which is they very essence of life

its such a stupid question in my opinion i mean how do you know what youre going to do till you do it the answer is you dont i think i am but how do i know i swear its a stupid question

you have to rely on whatever sparks you have inside

the difference between a nonsuicide and an exsuicide leaving the house for work at eight oclock on an ordinary morning

the nonsuicide is a little traveling suck of care sucking care with him from the past and being sucked toward care in the future his breath is high in his chest

the exsuicide opens his front door sits down on the steps and laughs since he has the option of being dead he has nothing to lose by being alive it is good to be alive he goes to work because he doesnt have to

by the truth we are undone life is a dream tis the waking that kills us he who robs us of our dreams robs us of our life

its faith in something and enthusiasm for something that makes a life worth living

rule of life if you bother to ask someone’s advice then bother to listen to it

isn’t it queer there are only two or three human stories and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they had never happened before like the larks in this country that have been singing the same five notes over for thousands of years

be in love with your life every detail of it

anything was better than nothing halffull was better than empty ignorance was the lowest form of humiliation and suffering

she who reconciles the illmatched threads

of her life and weaves them gratefully

into a single cloth –

it’s she who drives the loudmouths from the hall

and clears it for a different celebration

all life is only a set of pictures in the brain among which there is no difference betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreamings and no cause to value the one above the other

a little kid asks my dad why that man is chopping down the tree

and every day i thank god that i am alive not because i fear death but because my wife has a husband and my son is not an orphan

life goes on get over it youre still young itll get better blah blah blah

lifes not blackandwhite sometimes the ends justifies the means

so what is my story i dont know its long and twisted and not quite finished yet

may your life be filled as mine has been with love and laughter and remember when things are rough all you need is  chocolate

i am a fashion person and fashion is not only about clothes  its about all kinds of change

you dont win races by wishing you win them by running faster than everyone else does

so go out and live real good and i promise youll get beat up real bad but in a little while after youre dead youll be rotted away anyway its not gonna matter if you have a few scars it will matter if you didnt live

there is no thing as a singleissue struggle because we do not live singleissue lives

potential has a shelf life

there is nothing perfectonly life

we need people in our lives with whom we can be as open as possible to have real conversations with people may seem like such a simple obvious suggestion but it involves courage and risk

experience has shown and a true philosophy will always show that a vast perhaps the larger portion of truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant

i want an infinitely blank book and the rest of time

why didnt i learn to treat everything like it was the last time my greatest regret is how much i believed in the future

everything will be alright in the end so if it is not alright it is not the end

somewhere between love and hate lies confusion misunderstanding and desperate hope

you know people ask me they say dan three years later do you really want to be drawing cat whiskers on your face but they dont understand the cat whiskers they come from within

when writing there are some scenes that are emotionally overwhelming they completely overcome the author and only when they do this can they cause a similar reaction in the reader

through this the author gets to experience multiple lives if a characters life flashes before their eyes it flashes before the authors eyes too and he or she remembers it as his or her own

live your life be happy as you can be let go of the things that dont matter and fight

it takes no more time to see the good side of life than to see the bad

she looks at the swings and i can see she’s imagining what they’d look like if the kids weren’t there the guilt of this holds her down momentarily it appears to be there constantly never far away despite her love for them

i realize that nothing belongs to her anymore and she belongs to everything

life is a compromise of what your ego wants to do what experience tells you to do and what your nerves let you do

i know now after fifty years that the findinglosing forgettingremembering leavingreturning never stops the whole of life is about another chance and while we are alive till the very end there is always another chance

it is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique its not easy but if you accept your misfortune and handle it right your perceived failure can become a catalyst for profound reinvention

it is rare for people to be asked the question which puts them squarely in front of themselves

the dark unfathomd caves of ocean bear

full many a flower is born to blush unseen

and waste its sweetness on the desert air

try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of freewills involve and you find that you have excluded life itself

the ties that bind us to life are tougher than you imagine or than any one can who has not felt how roughly they may be pulled without breaking

i admire those who do good and expect nothing in return

no matter how many people give me advice i am going to do what my heart tells me to do

i always felt like you had to be important to have enemies

its okay we arent in the same class just dont forget that some of us watch the sunset too

happiness does not come from without it comes from within

womanhood stands for all that is pure and clean and noble she who does not make the world better for having lived in it has failed to be all that a woman should be

but all i could think of was how when nothing made sense and hadnt for ages you just have to grab onto anything you feel sure of

god put us here on this carnival ride we close our eyes never knowing where itll take us next

dreamers are mocked as impractical the truth is they are the most practical as their innovations lead to progress and a better way of life for all of us

paper is more patient than man

we just had a nearlife experience

and now i am here as alone as ive ever been i am seventeen years old this is not how its suppose to be this is not how my life is suppose to turn out

dont lose heart if its very difficult at times everything will come out all right and nobody can in the beginning do as he wishes

only when you accept that one day youll die can you let go and make the best out of life and thats the big secret thats the miracle

happiness is a state of mind a choice a way of living it is not something to be achieved it is something to be experienced

being faithful in the smallest things is the way to gain maintain and demonstrate the strength needed to accomplish something great

something that is yours forever is never precious

i just want someone to hear what i have to say and maybe if i talk long enough it’ll make sense

yesterday was a closed book tomorrow however was another story

anything that doesnt take years of your life and drive you to suicide hardly seems worth doing

the best way to waste your life is by taking notes the easiest way to avoid living is to just watch look for the details report dont participate

all evil is good become cancerous

i think choosing between men and women is like choosing between cake and ice cream youd be daft not to try both when there are so many different flavors

life is a waste of time and time is a waste of life so lets all get wasted and have the time of our lives

but in her life nothing was going to happen such was the will of god the future was a dark corridor and at the far end the door was bolted

without god life has no purpose and without purpose life has no meaning without meaning life has no significance or hope

our love was a twoperson game at least until one of us died and the other became a murderer

to pay attention this is our endless and proper work

i can chase you and i can catch you

but there is nothing i can do to make you mine

i am my own experiment i am my own work of art

he who robs us of our dreams robs us of our life

many things are not as they seem the worst things in life never are

its impossible to go through life unscathed nor should you want to by the hurts we accumulate we measure both our follies and our accomplishments

money is better than poverty if only for financial reasons

a life isnt measured in hours and minutes its the quality not the length

life starts out with everyone clapping when you take a poo and goes downhill from there

life is something that happens when you cant get to sleep

our life is made by the death of others

life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom

nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bullfighters

the more you believed in yourself the more you could trust yourself the more you trust yourself the less you compare yourself to others

life… for some it is battle for others its dancefor rich it is party for poor it is chance

no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace

so early its still almost dark out

im near the window with coffee

and the usual early morning stuff

that passes for thought

when i see the boy and his friend

walking up the road

to deliver the newspaper

they wear caps and sweaters

and one boy has a bag over his shoulder

they are so happy

they arent saying anything these boys

i think if they could they would take

each others arm

its early in the morning

and they are doing this thing together

they come on slowly

the sky is taking on light

though the moon still hangs pale over the water

such beauty that for a minute

death and ambition even love

doesnt enter into this

happiness it comes on

unexpectedly and goes beyond really

any early morning talk about it

the more you talk about them the more important they will feel the more you listen to them the more important you will make them feel

i failed to communicate thats why i chose to leave

all teachings are mere references the true experience is living your own life then even the holiest of words are only words

you will have five hundred million little bells and i shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water

when it rains it pours maybe the art of life is to convert tough times to great experiences we can choose to hate the rain or dance in it

its better to have a few faithful friends than numerous shallow friendships

what was the point of even having a conversation when words couldnt be trusted

i am so grateful for my troubles as i reflect back on my life i have come to realize that my greatest triumphs have been born of my greatest troubles

the things that stress me out havent changed

but i dont wanna lose anything

so i thought that at least i would change

im luckythat im afraid of losing something

but to believe that getting stuff is the purpose and aim of life is madness

oh god of dust and rainbows

help us to see

that without the dust the rainbow

would not be

her happiness floated like waves of ocean along the coast of her life she found lyrics of her life in his arms but she never sung her song

dont set your goals by what other people deem important

to be heroic is to be courageous enough to die for something to be inspirational is to be crazy enough to live a little

youre here to be light bringing out the godcolors in the world

matthew  the message

the people i distrust most are those who want to improve our lives but have only one course of action

i wouldnt have missed a single minute of it not for the whole world

atheism a religion dedicated to its own sense of smug superiority

be a true heart not a follower

take advantage of it now while you are young and suffer all you can because these things dont last your whole life

properly practiced knitting soothes the troubled spirit and it doesnt hurt the untroubled spirit either

isnt it sad how some peoples grip on their lives is so precarious that theyll embrace any preposterous delusion rather than face an occasional bleak truth

life is a perpetual yesterday for us

knowing it and seeing it are two different things

he stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields and hills to add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in his hair he spread his arm out wide i will go mad he annouced

virtue needs some cheaper thrills

poetry is a way of taking life by the throat

i cannot forecast to you the action of russia it is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma

sometimes you just have those days where everything goes wrong but sometimes and totally unexpectedly something can go right

coming forth into the light

i was born the day

what is

what was

and

what if

i was transformed the day

my ego shattered

and all the superficial material

things that mattered

to me before

to matter

i really came into being

the day i no longer cared about

what the world thought of me

only on my thoughts for

changing the world

remember your greatness

before you were born

and were still too tiny for

the human eye to see

you won the race for life

from among  million competitors

and yet

how fast you have forgotten

your strength

when your very existence

is proof of your greatness

you were born a winner

one who defied the odds

by surviving the most gruesome

battle of them all

and now that you are a giant

why do you even doubt victory

against smaller numbers

and wider margins

the only walls that exist

are those you have placed in your mind

and whatever obstacles you conceive

exist only because you have forgotten

what you have already

poetry by suzy kassem

the only true borders lie between day and night between life and death between hope and loss

real change is difficult at the beginning but gorgeous at the end change begins the moment you get the courage and step outside your comfort zone change begins at the end of your comfort zone

i had a dream about you i was sitting on your couch relating my succession of ideas on subconscious influence i asked you what they meant and you told me that free associations were a bad way to advance my political career

envy after all comes from wanting something that isnt yours but grief comes from losing something youve already had

every ounce of my cynicism is supported by historical precedent

hope is such a beautiful word but it often seems very fragile life is still being needlessly hurt and destroyed

in western lands beneath the sun

the flowers may rise in spring

the trees may bud the waters run

the merry finches sing

or there maybe tis cloudless night

and swaying branches bear

the elvenstars as jewels white

amid their branching hair

though here at journeys end i lie

beyond all towers strong and high

beyond all mountains steep

above all shadows rides the sun

and stars for ever dwell

i will not say the day is done

nor bid the stars farewellj

lottery a tax on people who are bad at math

the heart may freeze or it can burn the pain will ease and i can learn there is no future there is no past i live this moment as my last

you know my name not my story youve heard what ive done but not what ive been through

we started off trying to set up a small anarchist community but people wouldnt obey the rules

may all that have life be delivered from suffering

we fool ourselves so much we could do it for a living

the whole house seemed to exhale a melancholy breath of emptiness

if only you would realize some day how much have you hurt me

if only your heart ever craves for me or my presence…

if only you feel that love again someday for me

if only you are affected someday by my absence…

only you can end all my suffering and this unbearable pain

if only you would know what you could never procure…

if only you go through the memories of past once again

since the day you left my heart has bled no one has its cure…

if only you would bring that love those showers and that rain…

if only you would come back and see what damage you create

i’ve been waiting for your return since forever more…

if only you would see the woman that you have made

you said we cannot sail through how were you so sure

if only you can feel the old things that can never fade

you may have moved on but a piece of my heart is still with you…

i know how i’ve come so far alone i know how i’m able to wade

people say that i’m insane and you won’t ever come back again…

maybe you would have never made your separate way

maybe you would have stayed with me and proved everyone wrong…

if only you would know the pain of dying every day

if only you would feel the burden of smiling and being strong…

but what are loyalty and caring really worth

to me everything

the greatest wealth is health

sometimes it seemed to him that his life was delicate as a dandelion one little puff from any direction and it was blown to bits

remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose

we two boys together clinging

one the other never leaving

up and down the roads going north and south excursions making

armd and fearless eating drinking sleeping loving

no law less than ourselves owning sailing soldiering thieving

the turf or the seabeach dancing

fulfilling our foray

mens lives have meaning not their deaths

when humans were young they were pushed around in strollers when they were old they were pushed around in wheelchairs in between they were just pushed around

morning will come it has no choice

when was the last time you woke up and realized that today could be the best day of your life

after all if you run far enough no one can catch you

fleet kept running kaladin growled getting back under elhokar’s arm

what

he couldnt win but he kept running and when the storm caught him it didnt matter that he’d died because he’d run for all he had

sure all right the king sounded groggy though kaladin couldnt tell if it was the alcohol or the blood loss

we all die in the end you see kaladin said so i guess what truly matters is just how well youve run and elhokar youve kept running since your father was killed even if you screw up all the storming time

thank you the king said drowsy

those guys who want to have the mohawkwhich to me is the new business casual

the most important thing is this to be able at any moment to be free to choose a life that makes you happy

you live it forward but understand it backward

i wish i could say i felt guilty for what i did

i dont

but i have my life i’m living it it’s twisted exhausting uncertain and full of guilt but nonetheless there’s something there

you had to risk your life to get love you had to get right to the edge of death to ever be saved

the difference between school and life in school youre taught a lesson and then given a test in life youre given a test that teaches you a lesson

the life of every man is a diary in which he means to write one story and writes another and his humblest hour is when he compares the volume as it is with what he vowed to make it

i liked being a person i wanted to keep at it

i think of life as a good book the further you get into it the more it begins to make sense

kindness i’ve discovered is everything in life

it is part of the human nature always to judge others very severely andwhen the wind turns against usalways to find an excuse for our own misdeedsor to blame someone else for our mistakes

art and life are subjective not everybodys gonna dig what i dig but i reserve the right to dig it

if you dont get a goodnight kiss you get kafka dreams

one day can change your life one day can ruin your life all life is is three or four big days that change everything

when youre the most happening person at the party its time to leave

i think probably kindness is my number one attribute in a human being ill put it before any of the things like courage or bravery or generosity or anything else

brian sibley or brains even

oh gosh yes brains is one of the least you can be a lovely person without brains absolutely lovely kindness  that simple word to be kind  it covers everything to my mind

if youre kind thats it

if her enemies were brigans friends and her friends were brigans enemies then the two of them could walk through the world arm in arm and never be hit by arrows again

know what you want to do hold the thought firmly and do every day what should be done and every sunset will see you that much nearer the goal

i have given my word that only death will take me from you

i think that’s crap

i think a lot of people dream and while they are busy dreaming the really happy people the really successful people the really interesting powerful engaged people are busy doing

even though our time in this life is temporary if we live well enough our legacy will last forever

why can’t the world hear i ask myself within a few moments i ask it many times because it doesn’t care i finally answer and i know i’m right it’s like i’ve been chosen but chosen for what i ask

ill be happy if running and i can grow old together

one of the inescapable encumbrances of leading an interesting life is that there have to be moments when you almost lose it

our sweetest songs are those of saddest thought

letting go is the lesson letting go is always the lesson have you ever noticed how much of our agony is all tied up with craving and loss

sadly enough the most painful goodbyes are the ones that are left unsaid and never explained

oh sorry i was taking life seriously

it doesnt matter who you are or where you come from or how much money youve got in your pocket you have your own destiny and your own life ahead of you

dont give up its not over the universe is balanced every setback bears with it the seeds of a comeback

occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words their meanings can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart

the young always have the same problem  how to rebel and conform at the same time they have now solved this by defying their parents and copying one another

the world is merciless and its also very beautiful

i dont understand a thing about this world about people and why they do the things they do the more i find out the more i uncover the more i know the less i understand

because you can only die once but you can suffer forever

this world

that was our home

for a brief spell

but pain and grief

its a shame that not one of our problems

we depart

with a thousand regrets

in our hearts

a no does not hide anything but a yes very easily becomes a deception

nothing in this world compares to the comfort and security of having someone just hold your hand

whatever happens in your life no matter how troubling things might seem do not enter the neighbourhood of despair

even when all doors remain closed god wil open up a new path only for you be thankful it is easy to be thankful when all is well a sufi is thankful not only for what he has been given but also for all that has been denied

she laughed for her wasted difficult life that never had to be wasted or difficult in the first place

thats all you can do in this world no matter how strong the current beats against you or how heavy your burden or how tragic your love story you keep going

it seemed to me that this world has a serious shortage of both logic and kindness

you will be fine the fortune teller says there may be decisions to make and surprises in store life takes us to unexpected places sometimes the future is never set in stone remember that

excellenceperfection is not a destination it is a continuous journey that never ends

enjoy the little things for one day you may look back and realise they were the big things

man is the only animal that laughs and weeps for he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things are and what they ought to be

but life without meaning is the torture

of restlessness and vague desire

it is a boat longing for the sea and yet afraid

my biggest fault is that the faults i was born with grow bigger each year

nobody is so busy that they cant make time for the people they really care about

the rainy day

the day is cold and dark and dreary

it rains and the wind is never weary

the vine still clings to the mouldering wall

but at every gust the dead leaves fall

and the day is dark and dreary

my life is cold and dark and dreary

it rains and the wind is never weary

my thoughts still cling to the mouldering past

but the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast

and the days are dark and dreary

be still sad heart and cease repining

behind the clouds is the sun still shining

thy fate is the common fate of all

into each life some rain must fall

some days must be dark and dreary

i was not i was i am not i care not non fui fui non sum non curo

we remember the past live in the present and write the future

all this twaddle the existence of god atheism determinism liberation societies death etc are pieces of a chess game called language and they are amusing only if one does not preoccupy oneself with winning or losing this game of chess

the true definition of mental illness is when the majority of your time is spent in the past or future but rarely living in the realism of now

there had been times when he knew somewhere in him that he would get used to it whatever it was because he had learnt that some hard things became softer after a very little while

dont be afraid of death be afraid of the unlived life

being liked for the way you looked is worse than not being liked at all

finding the lesson behind every adversity will be the one important thing that helps get you through it

this is love i think a place where people who have been alone may lock together like hawks and spin in the air dizzy with surprise at the connection a place you go willingly and with wonder

love me when i least deserve it because thats when i really need it

the only thing you have to do in this life is die said mrs pinskyeverything else is a choice

skinny guys fight till theyre burger

all i know is i make sense to me its other people who seem complicated

ive come to know that what we want in life is the greatest indication of who we really are

true life lies in laughter love and work

life is a train of moods like a string of beads and as we pass through them they prove to be many colored lenses which paint the world their own hue and each shows us only what lies in its own focus

about

how

wed like to

and

we all

agreed on the

same

wed all

and now

that

we are hardly

any longer

we think more

about

how

and

do it

under the

now

that

most of

our lives

no one escapes from life alive

life itself is the proper binge

stop giving your life away to other people

the soul is like an uninhabited world

that comes to life only when

god lays his head

against us

everything that had happened was shockingly beautiful enough to make you crazy

this is not the end this is not even the beginning of the end this is just perhaps the end of the beginning

i thought about the days i had handed over to a bottlethe nights i cant rememberthe mornings i slept thruall the time spent running from myself

be happy  if youre not even happy whats so good about surviving

when you see a mistake in somebody else try to find if you are making the same mistake

this is the way to take judgment and to turn it into improvement

because no one needs to live for ever i think that sometimes you can outstay your welcome

most of us have the good or bad fortune of seeing our lives fall apart so slowly we barely notice

things dont always work out the way we hope you just have to pick yourself up and find a new direction to go in

to need of pity

or if compassion be freely

given out

take only enough

stop short of urge to plead

then purge away the need

than your own small heart

or greater than a star

with caress unmoved and cold

make of it a parka

for your soul

discover the reason why

so tiny human midget

exists at all

so scared unwise

but expect nothing live frugally

it’s a lack of clarity that creates chaos and frustration those emotions are poison to any living goal

people who fit don’t seek the seekers are those that don’t fit

i do not cling to life sufficiently to fear death

work harder on yourself than you do on your job

life is long and sometimes cruel sometimes victims are needed someone has to take on that role and human bodies are fragile easily damaged cut them and they bleed

some of the most beautiful things we have in life comes from our mistakes

our honeymoon will shine our life long its beams will only fade over your grave or mine

if you want something you dont wait for the world to deal it out for you you take it

but a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being nor can the dead ever be brought back to life

but certainly for us who understand life figures are a matter of indifference

love doesnt make the world go round love is what makes the ride worthwhile

having nothing to struggle

against

they have nothing to struggle

all successful people men and women are big dreamers they imagine what their future could be ideal in every respect and then they work every day toward their distant vision that goal or purpose

the hemulen woke up slowly and recognised himself and wished he had been someone he didnt know

a call to action had been born

so enjoy endure survive each moment as it comes to you in its proper sequence  a surprise

i believe life is constantly testing us for our level of commitment and lifes

greatest rewards are reserved for those who demonstrate a neverending

commitment to act until they achieve this level of resolve can move mountains but it must be constant and consistent as simplistic as this may

sound it is still the common denominator separating those who live their

dreams from those who live in regret

each player must accept the cards life deals him or her but once they are in hand he or she alone must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game

there are only a few notes just variations on a theme

love those who hurt you the most because they are probably the ones closest to you

they too are on a path and just like you they are learning to walk before they can fly imagine of everybody you hurt in life turned their backs on you you would be playing a hell of a lot of solitaire

love them no matter what

i feel very adventurous there are so many doors to be opened and im not afraid to look behind them

even if no salvation should come i want to be worthy of it at every moment

every single desire can lead to dream and every single dream has possibility to become reality

you mean there is pleasure in having no pleasure

heaven is an idea constructed by man to help him cope with the fact that life on earth is both brutally short and paradoxically far too long

someone once said that death is not the greatest loss in life the greatest loss is what dies inside of us while we live i could tell you who said it but who the hell really cares

read deeply stay open continue to wonder

you know whats truly weird about any financial crisis we made it up currency money finance theyre all social inventions when the sun comes up in the morning its shining on the same physical landscape all the atoms are in place

the game we make of love

like everyone’s playing checkers

with their scars

whenever they get out

why are you selling those asked the little prince

because they save a tremendous amount of time said the merchant computations have been made by experts with these pills you save fiftythree minutes in every week

and what do i do with those fiftythree minutes

anything you like

as for me said the little prince to himself if i had fiftythree minutes to spend as i liked i should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water

ive screwed everything up royally i remember you saying that growing up happens when you start having things you look back on and wish you could change

who lives longer the man who takes heroin for two years and dies or a man who lives on roast beef water and potatoes till  one passes his  months in eternity all the years of the beefeater are lived only in time

attack life its going to kill you anyway

try to enjoy myself when i can  ill be miserable enough as it is

never let fear hold you captive

never let selfdoubt hold you captive

never let frustration hold you captive

great goals make great people people cannot hit what they do not aim for

goals are the road maps that guide you to your destination

cultivate the habit of setting clearlydefined written goals they are the road maps that guide you to your destination

if you would create something

you must be something

i’ll never second guess the things that i have done i’ve got too much left to say and too much to become

destiny is a lie destiny is justification for atrocity it is the means by which murderers armour themselves against reprimand it is a word intended to stand in place of ethics denying all moral context

killers arent always assassins sometimes they dont even have blood on their hands

the dead do not hurt you only the living do

the more you seek security the less of it you have but the more you seek

opportunity the more likely it is that you will achieve the security that you

therere things we keep hidden from one another things we hide from ourselves things that are kept hidden from us and things no one knows you always learn the damnedest things at the worst possible times

there are some places in life where you can only go alone embrace the beauty of your solo journey

that is life to begin again when everything is lost

life is but a memory happened long ago theatre full of sadness for a long forgotten show

some of us werent born for rewards froi we were born for sacrifices

war had bled color from everything leaving nothing but a storm of gray

remember that life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away

it strikes me profoundly that the world is more often than not a bad and cruel place

my father chose my name  and my last name was chosen by my ancestors  that’s enough i myself choose my way

dustfinger inspected his reddened fingers and felt the taut skin ‘he might tell me how my story ends’ he murmured

meggie looked at him in astonishment ‘you mean you don’t know’

dustfinger smiled meggie still didn’t particularly like his smile it seemed to appear only to hide something else ‘what’s so unusual about that princess’ he asked quietly ‘do you know how your story ends’

meggie had no answer for that

you can con god and get away with it granny said if you do so with charm and wit if you live your life with imagination and verve god will play along just to see what outrageously entertaining thing youll do next

nothing is more natural than mutual misunderstanding the contrary is always surprising i believe that one never agrees on anything except by mistake and that all harmony among human beings is the happy fruit of an error

no one survives life

the moment she was cursed i lost her once it wears off soon she will be embarrassed to remember things that she said things she did things like this no matter how solid she feels in my arms she is made of smoke

because people who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves theyd never admit in normal conversation its a way for people to be honest without telling the truth
