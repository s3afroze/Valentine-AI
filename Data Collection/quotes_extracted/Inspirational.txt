and when you want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it

it’s no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then

what youre supposed to do when you dont like a thing is change it if you cant change it change the way you think about it dont complain

do what you feel in your heart to be right – for you’ll be criticized anyway

as you are about your own

to forget the mistakes of the past

and press on to the greater achievements of the future

to wear a cheerful countenance at all times

and give every living creature you meet a smile

to give so much time to the improvement of yourself

that you have no time to criticize others

to be too large for worry too noble for anger too strong for fear

and too happy to permit the presence of trouble

lightly child lightly learn to do everything lightly

yes feel lightly even though you’re feeling deeply

just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them

i was so preposterously serious in those days such a humorless little prig

lightly lightly – it’s the best advice ever given me

when it comes to dying even nothing ponderous or portentous or emphatic

no rhetoric no tremolos

no self conscious persona putting on its celebrated imitation of christ or little nell

and of course no theology no metaphysics

just the fact of dying and the fact of the clear light

so throw away your baggage and go forward

there are quicksands all about you sucking at your feet

the three great essentials to achieve anything worthwhile are first hard work second sticktoitiveness third common sense

to live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else

be the positive impact on the lives of others

no man chooses evil because it is evil he only mistakes it for happiness the good he seeks

turn your obstacles into opportunities and your problems into possibilities

you’re not obligated to win you’re obligated to keep trying to the best you can do everyday

real magic can never be made by offering someone elses liver you must tear out your own and not expect to get it back

do not look for healing

at the feet of those

who broke you

my happiness is not the means to any end it is the end it is its own goal it is its own purpose

you must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible

its worth making time to find the things that really stir your soul that’s what makes you really feel alive you have to say ‘no’ to other things you’re used to and do it with all your heart

it feminism is mixed up with a muddled idea that women are free when they serve their employers but slaves when they help their husbands

never let hard lessons harden your heart the hard lessons of life are meant to make you better not bitter

you become what you think about all day long

so early in my life i had learned that if you want something you had better make some noise

every great dream begins with a dreamer always remember you have within you the strength the patience and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world

heaven can be found in the most unlikely corners

sit in a room and readand read and read and read the right books by the right people your mind is brought onto that level and you have a nice mild slowburning rapture all the time

the reality of the other person lies not in what he reveals to you but what he cannot reveal to you

therefore if you would understand him listen not to what he says but rather to what he does not say

learning to distance yourself from all the negativity is one of the greatest lessons to achieve inner peace

most of us must learn to love people and use things rather than loving things and using people

never respond to an angry person with a fiery comeback even if he deserves itdont allow his anger to become your anger

great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together

i postpone death by living by suffering by error by risking by giving by losing

think believe dream and dare

when one has a grateful heart life is so beautiful

maktub it is written

some things cannot be taught they must be experienced you never learn the most valuable lessons in life until you go through your own journey

im going to paraphrase thoreau here rather than love than money than faith than fame than fairness give me truth

it doesn’t matter how many times you get knocked down all that matters is you get up one more time than you were knocked down

failure is a bend in the road not the end of the road learn from failure and keep moving forward

you get in life what you have the courage to ask for

i offer you peace i offer you love i offer you friendship i see your beauty i hear your need i feel your feelings

it takes guts and humility to admit mistakes admitting were wrong is courage not weakness

i am always doing that which i can not do in order that i may learn how to do it

desperation is the raw material of drastic change only those who can leave behind everything they have ever believed in can hope to escape

i would rather make mistakes in kindness and compassion than work miracles in unkindness and hardness

when defeat comes accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound rebuild those plans and set sail once more toward your coveted goal

hearing voices no one else can hear isnt a good sign even in the wizarding world

in response somewhere from within me rises a nowfamiliar presence offering me all the certainties i have always wished another person would say to me when i was troubled this is what i find myself writing on the page

tonight this strange interior gesture of friendship—the lending of a hand from

never forget that once upon a time in an unguarded moment you recognized yourself as a friend…

what would you do if you werent afraid

before i wanted to say i found love but now i want to say i found a person and he belongs to me and i belong to him

the way i see it if you want the rainbow you gotta put up with the rain

it was like the beginning of life and laughter it was the real meaning of the sun

if my mind can conceive it and my heart can believe it  then i can achieve it

i have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes what matters is not what i think of him but what he thinks of himself hurting a man in his dignity is a crime

you come of the lord adam and the lady eve said aslan and that is both honour enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar and shame enough to bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor on earth be content

the less you associate with some people the more your life will improve

any time you tolerate mediocrity in others it increases your mediocrity an

important attribute in successful people is their impatience with negative

thinking and negative acting people as you grow your associates will

change some of your friends will not want you to go on they will want you

to stay where they are friends that dont help you climb will want you to

crawl your friends will stretch your vision or choke your dream those that

dont increase you will eventually decrease you

consider this

never receive counsel from unproductive people never discuss your problems

with someone incapable of contributing to the solution because those who

never succeed themselves are always first to tell you how not everyone has

a right to speak into your life you are certain to get the worst of the

bargain when you exchange ideas with the wrong person dont follow anyone

whos not going anywhere

with some people you spend an evening with others you invest it be careful

where you stop to inquire for directions along the road of life wise is the

person who fortifies his life with the right friendships if you run with

wolves you will learn how to howl but if you associate with eagles you

will learn how to soar to great heights

a mirror reflects a mans face but what he is really like is shown by the

kind of friends he chooses

the simple but true fact of life is that you become like those with whom you

closely associate  for the good and the bad

yesdo love appreciate and be thankful for your family for they will

always be your family no matter what just know that they are human first

and though they are family to you they may be a friend to someone else and

will fit somewhere in the criteria above

in prosperity our friends know us in adversity we know our friends

never make someone a priority when you are only an option for them

if you are going to achieve excellence in big thingsyou develop the habit in little matters

excellence is not an exception it is a prevailing attitude

until you step into the unknown you don’t know what you’re made of

the beautiful journey of today can only begin when we learn to let go of yesterday

people have only as much liberty as they have the intelligence to want and the courage to take

all great achievements require time

you learn something valuable from all of the significant events and people but you never touch your true potential until you challenge yourself to go beyond imposed limitations

dont wait for the right moment to start start and make each moment right

i dont fit into any stereotypes and i like myself that way

don’t wait for things to happen make them happen

can you remember who you were before the world told you who you should be

good things happen in your life when you surround yourself with positive people

the first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit the second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are

he who would learn to fly one day must first learn to walk and run and climb and dance one cannot fly into flying

next time youre faced with a choice do the right thing it hurts everyone less in the long run

faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark

we should not judge people by their peak of excellence but by the distance they have traveled from the point where they started

words save our lives sometimes

believe there is a great power silently working all things for good behave yourself and never mind the rest

enjoy every step you take if youre curious there is always something new to be discovered in the backdrop of your daily life

set your face towards danger

set your heart on victory

be silent and safe — silence never betrays you

be true to your word and your work and your friend

put least trust in him who is foremost to praise you

nor judge of a road till it draw to the end

hate looks like everybody else until it smiles

if you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same then everything that happens in between can be dealt with

ruin is a gift ruin is the road to transformation

it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit

effective ways to make others feel important

use their name

do more listening than talking

talk more about them than about you

be authentically interested

be sincere in your praise

show you care

dont live down to expectations go out there and do something remarkable

as is a tale so is life not how long it is but how good it is is what matters

what you stay focused on will grow

good people see the good and bring out the best in other people

be soft do not let the world make you hard do not let the pain make you hate do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree you still believe it to be a beautiful place

when things do not go your way remember that every challenge — every adversity — contains within it the seeds of opportunity and growth

the minute i stopped trying to find the right girl and started trying to become the right guythe girl came

make the most of the best and the best of the worst and keep your standards high never settle for anything less than you deserve or are capable of achieving

the world is so empty if one thinks only of mountains rivers  cities but to know someone who thinks  feels with us  who though distant is close to us in spirit this makes the earth for us an inhabited garden

pointing to another world will never stop vice among us shedding light over this world can alone help us

an eye is meant to see things

the soul is here for its own joy

a head has one use for loving a true love

feet to chase after

love is for vanishing into the sky the mind

for learning what men have done and tried to do

mysteries are not to be solved the eye goes blind

when it only wants to see why

a lover is always accused of something

but when he finds his love whatever was lost

in the looking comes back completely changed

i hate to say it but shit really does happen you just have to get over it beat the hell out of it by doing things that make you happy

maybe this is why we read and why in moments of darkness we return to books to find words for what we already know

love is too precious to be ashamed of

never ever let anyone tell you what you can and cant do prove the cynics wrong pity them for they have no imagination the skys the limit your sky your limit now lets dance

reality is wrong dreams are for the real

success is not the key to happiness happiness is the key to success if you love what you are doing you will be successful

things die but they dont always stay dead believe me i know

everyone enjoys being acknowledged and appreciated sometimes even the simplest act of gratitude can change someones entire day take the time to recognize and value the people around you and appreciate those who make a difference in your lives

you will never be able to escape from your heart so its better to listen to what it has to say

there is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort

be yourself no base imitator of another but your best self there is something which you can do better than another listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that do the things at which you are great not what you were never made for

we are all worms but i do believe that i am a glow worm

nothing will work unless you do

the one who falls and gets up is stronger than the one who never tried do not fear failure but rather fear not trying

i want to thank you lord for life and all thats in it

thank you for the day and for the hour and the minute

do not let the roles you play in life make you forget who you are

if you haven’t the strength to impose your own terms upon life then you must accept the terms it offers you

when i find myself in times of trouble mother mary comes to me

speaking words of wisdom let it be

and in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me

speaking words of wisdom let it be

let it be let it be let it be let it be

whisper words of wisdom let it be

and when the broken hearted people living in the world agree

there will be an answer let it be

for though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see

there will be an answer let it be

let it be let it be

and when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me

shine until tomorrow let it be

i wake up to the sound of music mother mary comes to me

speaking words of wisdom let it be

let it be let it be

when you have exhausted all possibilities remember this  you havent

selfrespect is the root of discipline the sense of dignity grows

with the ability to say no to oneself

there aint no journey what dont change you some

stop feeling sorry for yourself and you will be happy

when you judge another you do not define them you define yourself

you were born to stand out stop trying to fit in

god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference

love fall in love and stay in love write only what you love and love what you write the word is love you have to get up in the morning and write something you love something to live for

beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin its about knowing and accepting who you are

it doesnt matter if a million people tell you what you cant do or if ten million tell you no if you get one yes from god thats all you need

change may not always bring growth but there is no growth without change

when you take control of your attitude you take control of your life

enthusiasm can help you find the new doors but it takes passion to open them if you have a strong purpose in life you dont have to be pushed your passion will drive you there

let go of something old that no longer serves you in order to make room for something new

i think that one of these days he said youre going to have to find out where you want to go and then youve got to start going there but immediately you cant afford to lose a minute not you

each person deserves a day away in which no problems are confronted no solutions searched for

once you learn to quit it becomes a habit

it is not the failure of others to appreciate your abilities that should trouble you but rather your failure to appreciate theirs

it only takes a split second to smile and forget yet to someone that needed it it can last a lifetime

she had become accustomed to being lonely she was used to walking alone and to being considered different she did not suffer too much

love yourself first and everything else falls into line your really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world

successful people have no fear of failure but unsuccessful people do successful people have the resilience to face up to failure—learn the lessons and adapt from it

what other people think and say about you is none of your business the most destructive thing you would ever do is to believe someone elses opinion of you you have to stop letting other peoples opinions control you

your deepest desires

through all that you reach for

may your arms never tire

scars are just another kind of memory

you need to find a way to live your life that it doesnt make a mockery of your values

your sacred space is where you can find yourself over and over again

we stood there looking at each other saying nothing but it was the kind of nothing that meant everything in his eyes there was no trace of what had happened between us earlier and i could feel something inside me break

so that was that we were finally finally over

i looked at him and i felt so sad because this thought occurred to me i will never look at you the same way again ill never be that girl again the girl who comes running back every time you push her away the girl who loves you anyway

i couldn’t even be mad at him because this was who he was this was who he’d

always been he’d never lied about that he gave and then he took away i felt it in the pit of my stomach the familiar ache that lost regretful feeling only he could give me i never wanted to feel it again never ever

maybe this was why i came so i could really know so i could say goodbye

i looked at him and i thought if i was very brave or very honest i would tell him

i would say it so he would know it and i would know it and i could never take it back but i wasn’t that brave or honest so all i did was look at him and i think he knew anyway

i release you i evict you from my heart because if i dont do it now i never will

i was the one to look away first

remember your greatness

before you were born

and were still too tiny for

the human eye to see

you won the race for life

from among  million competitors

and yet

how fast you have forgotten

your strength

when your very existence

is proof of your greatness

you were born a winner

one who defied the odds

by surviving the most gruesome

battle of them all

and now that you are a giant

why do you even doubt victory

against smaller numbers

and wider margins

the only walls that exist

are those you have placed in your mind

and whatever obstacles you conceive

exist only because you have forgotten

what you have already

when purpose is not known abuse is inevitable

but life without meaning is the torture

of restlessness and vague desire

everything works out to be

happily everafter

the upsidedown insideout version

test of my character comes in

do i sink or do i swim

do i wallow in self pity and play the victim

or simply shift gears

and make the best of the situation

the choice is all mine

life is all about how you handle plan b

photo by shawn nystrand

the rain

spoke to me

what joy

to come falling

out of the brisk cloud…

that’s what it said

as it dropped

and vanished…

then it was over

the sky cleared

i was standing

under a tree

the tree was a tree

with happy leaves

and i was myself

and there were stars in the sky

that were also themselves

at the moment

at which moment

my right hand

was holding my left hand

which was holding the tree

which was filled with stars

and the soft rain –

the long and wondrous journeys

still to be ours

i am the master of my fate and the captain of my destiny

books didn’t make me wallow in darkness darkness made me wallow in books

it has been my philosophy of life that difficulties vanish when faced boldly

maybe i hope too much maybe i dream too much or maybe i love too much to just give up on you

im not afraid of dying im afraid ill never get a chance to live

perfection is not attainable but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence

we become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become each day

the home we seek is in eternity

the truth we seek is like a shoreless sea

of which your paradise is but a drop

this ocean can be yours why should you stop

beguiled by dreams of evanescent dew

the secrets of the sun are yours but you

content yourself with motes trapped in its beams

turn to what truly lives reject what seems

which matters more the body or the soul

be whole desire and journey to the whole

in life you need either inspiration or desperation

if you are under the impression you have already perfected yourself you will never rise to the heights you are no doubt capable of

if youre waiting until you feel talented enough to make it youll never make it

there is no rest for the person who has envy and there is no love for the person who has bad manners

there are souls in this world who have the gift of finding joy everywhere and leaving it behind them when they go

no lake so still but it has its wave

no circle so perfect but that it has its blur

i would change things for you if i could as i cant you must take them as they are

we give glory to god when we trust him to do what he has promised to do–especially when all human possibilities are exhausted faith glorifies god that is why god planned for faith to be the way we are justified

live out of your imagination instead of out of your memory

there are moments in every relationship that define when two people start to fall in love

i remove the darth vader house shoes from my satchel and look down at them

you were wearing these during one of those moments

one of the moments i first started to fall in love with you

the way you gave me butterflies that morning

had absolutely nothing to do with anyone else

and everything to do with you

i was falling in love with you that morning

because of you

i take the next item out of the satchel when i pull it out and look up she brings her hands to her mouth in shock

this ugly little gnome

with his smug little grin…

hes the reason i had an excuse to invite you into my house

into my life

you took a lot of aggression out on him over those next few months

i would watch from my window as you would kick him over every time you walked by him

you were so tenacious

that feisty aggressive strongwilled side of you…

the side of you that refused to take crap from this concrete gnome

the side of you that refused to take crap from me

i fell in love with that side of you

because of you

i set the gnome down on the stage and grab the cd

this is your favorite cd

‘layken’s shit’

although now i know you intended for shit to be possessive rather than descriptive

the banjo started playing through the speakers of your car

and i immediately recognized my favorite band

then when i realized it was your favorite band too

the fact that these same lyrics inspired both of us

i fell in love with that about you

that had absolutely nothing to do with anyone else

i fell in love with that about you

because of you

i take a slip of paper out of the satchel and hold it up when i look at her i see eddie slide her a napkin i can’t tell from up here but that can only mean she’s crying

this is a receipt i kept

only because the item i purchased that night was on the verge of ridiculous

chocolate milk on the rocks who orders that

you were different and you didn’t care

you were being you

a piece of me fell in love with you at that moment

because of you

this i hold up another sheet of paper

this i didn’t really like so much

it’s the poem you wrote about me

the one you titled mean

i don’t think i ever told you…

but you made a zero

and then i kept it

to remind myself of all the things i never want to be to you

i pull her shirt from my bag when i hold it into the light i sigh into the microphone

this is that ugly shirt you wear

it doesn’t really have anything to do with why i fell in love with you

i just saw it at your house and thought i’d steal it

only those are fit to live who do not fear to die and none are fit to die who have shrunk from the joy of life and the duty of life both life and death are parts of the same great adventure

sober gainfully employed and physically secure once again kevin began to relax his confidence slowly returned for the first time since the onset of his blindness he let his guard down and a crack in his carefully constructed veneer formed

i used to have a sign pinned up on my wall that read only to the extent that we expose ourselves over and over to annihilation can that which is indestructible be found in usit was all about letting go of everything

we pencilsketch our previous life so we can contrast it to the technicolor of the moment

no namecalling truly bites deep unless in some dark part of us we believe it if we are confident enough then it is just noise

she could hear some way off her brothers calling to each other in the woods behind the house she hoped desperately that their game wouldnt bring them any closer that they wouldnt scare the birds away

she tried to slow her breathing hoping somehow to make this moment last forever

maybe it just means that love can be stronger than fear

i want to be justice love and the wrath of god all in one

out out brief candle life is but a walking shadowa tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing

id rather die while im living than live while im dead

wake up shake up make up and break up life is all about moving like ant in search of sugar not sand

only when we give joyfully without hesitation or thought of gain can we truly know what love means

cause karma karma karma comes back to you hard

love unflinching that cannot lie

read books care about things get excited try not to be too down on youself enjoy the ever present game of knowing

if you are her man she will talk to you until there just

aren’t any more words left to say encourage you when you’re

at rock bottom and think there just isn’t any way out hold you

in her arms when you’re sick and laugh with you when you’re

up and if you’re her man and that woman loves you—i mean

really loves you—she will shine you up when you’re dusty

encourage you when you’re down defend you even when she’s

not so sure you were right and hang on your every word even

when you’re not saying anything worth listening to

tragedy and adversary are the stones we sharpen our swords against so we can fight new battles

align yourself with people that you can learn from people who want more out of life people who are stretching and searching and seeking some higher ground in life

shoot for the moon because even if you miss you miss youll land in the stars

everything that had happened was shockingly beautiful enough to make you crazy

this is not the end this is not even the beginning of the end this is just perhaps the end of the beginning

it’s dark because you are trying too hard

lightly child lightly learn to do everything lightly

yes feel lightly even though you’re feeling deeply

just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them

i was so preposterously serious in those days such a humorless little prig

lightly lightly – it’s the best advice ever given me

when it comes to dying even nothing ponderous or portentous or emphatic

no rhetoric no tremolos

no self conscious persona putting on its celebrated imitation of christ or little nell

and of course no theology no metaphysics

just the fact of dying and the fact of the clear light

so throw away your baggage and go forward

there are quicksands all about you sucking at your feet

trying to suck you down into fear and selfpity and despair

that’s why you must walk so lightly

lightly my darling

on tiptoes and no luggage

not even a sponge bag

get up stand up stand up for your rights get up stand up dont give up the fight

you may choose to look the other way but you can never say again that you did not know

though the roads been rocky it sure feels good to me

a woman in harmony with her spirit

is like a river flowing

she goes where she will without pretense and arrives at her destination

prepared to be herself

and only herself

that which god said to the rose and caused it to laugh in fullblown beauty he said to my heart and made it a hundred times more beautiful

the three great essentials to achieve anything worthwhile are first hard work second sticktoitiveness third common sense

even if things dont unfold the way you expected dont be disheartened or give up one who continues to advance will win in the end

to live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else

be the positive impact on the lives of others

no man chooses evil because it is evil he only mistakes it for happiness the good he seeks

remember tonight for it is the beginning of always

keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground

i remembered the fox one runs the risk of crying a bit if one allows oneself to be tamed

its not about how to achieve your dreams its about how to lead your life  if you lead your life the right way the karma will take care of itself the dreams will come to you

to the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world

the stupid neither forgive nor forget the naive forgive and forget the wise forgive but do not forget

turn your obstacles into opportunities and your problems into possibilities

you’re not obligated to win you’re obligated to keep trying to the best you can do everyday

real magic can never be made by offering someone elses liver you must tear out your own and not expect to get it back

do not look for healing

at the feet of those

who broke you

my happiness is not the means to any end it is the end it is its own goal it is its own purpose

you must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible

its worth making time to find the things that really stir your soul that’s what makes you really feel alive you have to say ‘no’ to other things you’re used to and do it with all your heart

it feminism is mixed up with a muddled idea that women are free when they serve their employers but slaves when they help their husbands

dreams dont work unless you take action the surest way to make your dreams come true is to live them

go and make interesting mistakes make amazing mistakes make glorious and fantastic mistakes break rules leave the world more interesting for your being here

we are saved by faith alone but the faith that saves is never alone

i dont paint dreams or nightmares i paint my own reality

what is now proved was once only imagined

feet what do i need them for

gratitude builds a bridge to abundance

when you hold a grudge you want someone else’s sorrow to reflect your level of hurt but the two rarely meet

the place where you made your stand never mattered only that you were thereand still on your feet

never let hard lessons harden your heart the hard lessons of life are meant to make you better not bitter

you become what you think about all day long

so early in my life i had learned that if you want something you had better make some noise

every great dream begins with a dreamer always remember you have within you the strength the patience and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world

heaven can be found in the most unlikely corners

sit in a room and readand read and read and read the right books by the right people your mind is brought onto that level and you have a nice mild slowburning rapture all the time

the reality of the other person lies not in what he reveals to you but what he cannot reveal to you

therefore if you would understand him listen not to what he says but rather to what he does not say

learning to distance yourself from all the negativity is one of the greatest lessons to achieve inner peace

most of us must learn to love people and use things rather than loving things and using people

never respond to an angry person with a fiery comeback even if he deserves itdont allow his anger to become your anger

great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together

i postpone death by living by suffering by error by risking by giving by losing

think believe dream and dare

darling when things go wrong in life you lift your chin put on a ravishing smile mix yourself a little cocktail

see as much as you want to hold on to the bitter sore memory that someone has left this world you are still in it

instead of cursing the darkness light a candle

if we will be quiet and ready enough we shall find compensation in every disappointment

today is your day

youre off to great places

youre off and away

life is a gift dont forget to live it

i didnt come here of my own accord and i cant leave that way

whoever brought me here will have to take me home

a creative life cannot be sustained by approval any more than it can be destroyed by criticism

the greatest ideas are the simplest

it takes sunshine and rain to make a rainbow there would be no rainbows without sunshine and rain

in school we learn that mistakes are bad and we are punished for making them yet if you look at the way humans are designed to learn we learn by making mistakes we learn to walk by falling down if we never fell down we would never walk

when one has a grateful heart life is so beautiful

maktub it is written

some things cannot be taught they must be experienced you never learn the most valuable lessons in life until you go through your own journey

the best relationships in our lives are the best not because they have been the happiest ones they are that way because they have stayed strong through the most tormentful of storms

she made broken look beautiful

and strong look invincible

she walked with the universe

on her shoulders and made it

do you really want to be happy you can begin by being appreciative of who you are and what youve got

ive been lucky opportunities dont often come along so when they do you have to grab them

i’ve come to the conclusion that people who wear headphones while they walk are much happier more confident and more beautiful individuals than someone making the solitary drudge to work without acknowledging their own interests and power

it is the possibility that keeps me going and though you may call me a dreamer or a fool or any other thing i believe that anything is possible

the place god calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet

they laugh at me because im different i laugh at them because theyre all the same

life begins on the other side of despair

the soul should always stand ajar ready to welcome the ecstatic experience

i am always doing what i cannot do yet in order to learn how to do it

the truth knocks on the door and you say go away im looking for the truth and so it goes away puzzling

challenge and adversity are meant to help you know who you are storms hit your weakness but unlock your true strength

nothing makes a person happier than having a happy heart

we all need to be mocked from time to time lest we take ourselves too seriously

difficulties strengthen the mind as labor does the body

if we ever forget that were one nation under god then we will be one nation gone under

friendship with oneself is all important because without it one cannot be friends with anyone else in the world

im going to paraphrase thoreau here rather than love than money than faith than fame than fairness give me truth

it doesn’t matter how many times you get knocked down all that matters is you get up one more time than you were knocked down

failure is a bend in the road not the end of the road learn from failure and keep moving forward

you get in life what you have the courage to ask for

i offer you peace i offer you love i offer you friendship i see your beauty i hear your need i feel your feelings

it takes guts and humility to admit mistakes admitting were wrong is courage not weakness

i am always doing that which i can not do in order that i may learn how to do it

desperation is the raw material of drastic change only those who can leave behind everything they have ever believed in can hope to escape

i would rather make mistakes in kindness and compassion than work miracles in unkindness and hardness

when defeat comes accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound rebuild those plans and set sail once more toward your coveted goal

hearing voices no one else can hear isnt a good sign even in the wizarding world

in response somewhere from within me rises a nowfamiliar presence offering me all the certainties i have always wished another person would say to me when i was troubled this is what i find myself writing on the page

tonight this strange interior gesture of friendship—the lending of a hand from

never forget that once upon a time in an unguarded moment you recognized yourself as a friend…

what would you do if you werent afraid

before i wanted to say i found love but now i want to say i found a person and he belongs to me and i belong to him

the only limits for tomorrow are the doubts we have today

if we all did the things we are really capable of doing we would literally astound ourselves

the way i see it if you want the rainbow you gotta put up with the rain

you cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future

stop doing what is easy start doing what is right

changing your outside world cannot make you happy if you are an unhappy person the real personal change can only happen from the inside out if you firstly create the change within yourself you can turn your life around

it was like the beginning of life and laughter it was the real meaning of the sun

if my mind can conceive it and my heart can believe it  then i can achieve it

i have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes what matters is not what i think of him but what he thinks of himself hurting a man in his dignity is a crime

you come of the lord adam and the lady eve said aslan and that is both honour enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar and shame enough to bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor on earth be content

the less you associate with some people the more your life will improve

any time you tolerate mediocrity in others it increases your mediocrity an

important attribute in successful people is their impatience with negative

thinking and negative acting people as you grow your associates will

change some of your friends will not want you to go on they will want you

to stay where they are friends that dont help you climb will want you to

crawl your friends will stretch your vision or choke your dream those that

dont increase you will eventually decrease you

consider this

never receive counsel from unproductive people never discuss your problems

with someone incapable of contributing to the solution because those who

never succeed themselves are always first to tell you how not everyone has

a right to speak into your life you are certain to get the worst of the

bargain when you exchange ideas with the wrong person dont follow anyone

whos not going anywhere

with some people you spend an evening with others you invest it be careful

where you stop to inquire for directions along the road of life wise is the

person who fortifies his life with the right friendships if you run with

wolves you will learn how to howl but if you associate with eagles you

will learn how to soar to great heights

a mirror reflects a mans face but what he is really like is shown by the

kind of friends he chooses

the simple but true fact of life is that you become like those with whom you

closely associate  for the good and the bad

note be not mistaken this is applicable to family as well as friends

yesdo love appreciate and be thankful for your family for they will

always be your family no matter what just know that they are human first

and though they are family to you they may be a friend to someone else and

will fit somewhere in the criteria above

in prosperity our friends know us in adversity we know our friends

never make someone a priority when you are only an option for them

if you are going to achieve excellence in big thingsyou develop the habit in little matters

excellence is not an exception it is a prevailing attitude

until you step into the unknown you don’t know what you’re made of

the beautiful journey of today can only begin when we learn to let go of yesterday

people have only as much liberty as they have the intelligence to want and the courage to take

all great achievements require time

you learn something valuable from all of the significant events and people but you never touch your true potential until you challenge yourself to go beyond imposed limitations

dont wait for the right moment to start start and make each moment right

i dont fit into any stereotypes and i like myself that way

don’t wait for things to happen make them happen

can you remember who you were before the world told you who you should be

good things happen in your life when you surround yourself with positive people

the first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit the second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are

he who would learn to fly one day must first learn to walk and run and climb and dance one cannot fly into flying

next time youre faced with a choice do the right thing it hurts everyone less in the long run

faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark

we should not judge people by their peak of excellence but by the distance they have traveled from the point where they started

words save our lives sometimes

believe there is a great power silently working all things for good behave yourself and never mind the rest

enjoy every step you take if youre curious there is always something new to be discovered in the backdrop of your daily life

set your face towards danger

set your heart on victory

be silent and safe — silence never betrays you

be true to your word and your work and your friend

put least trust in him who is foremost to praise you

nor judge of a road till it draw to the end

hate looks like everybody else until it smiles

if you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same then everything that happens in between can be dealt with

ruin is a gift ruin is the road to transformation

it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit

effective ways to make others feel important

use their name

do more listening than talking

talk more about them than about you

be authentically interested

be sincere in your praise

show you care

dont live down to expectations go out there and do something remarkable

as is a tale so is life not how long it is but how good it is is what matters

what you stay focused on will grow

good people see the good and bring out the best in other people

be soft do not let the world make you hard do not let the pain make you hate do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree you still believe it to be a beautiful place

when things do not go your way remember that every challenge — every adversity — contains within it the seeds of opportunity and growth

the minute i stopped trying to find the right girl and started trying to become the right guythe girl came

make the most of the best and the best of the worst and keep your standards high never settle for anything less than you deserve or are capable of achieving

the world is so empty if one thinks only of mountains rivers  cities but to know someone who thinks  feels with us  who though distant is close to us in spirit this makes the earth for us an inhabited garden

pointing to another world will never stop vice among us shedding light over this world can alone help us

an eye is meant to see things

the soul is here for its own joy

a head has one use for loving a true love

feet to chase after

love is for vanishing into the sky the mind

for learning what men have done and tried to do

mysteries are not to be solved the eye goes blind

when it only wants to see why

a lover is always accused of something

but when he finds his love whatever was lost

in the looking comes back completely changed

i hate to say it but shit really does happen you just have to get over it beat the hell out of it by doing things that make you happy

maybe this is why we read and why in moments of darkness we return to books to find words for what we already know

love is too precious to be ashamed of

never ever let anyone tell you what you can and cant do prove the cynics wrong pity them for they have no imagination the skys the limit your sky your limit now lets dance

reality is wrong dreams are for the real

success is not the key to happiness happiness is the key to success if you love what you are doing you will be successful

things die but they dont always stay dead believe me i know

everyone enjoys being acknowledged and appreciated sometimes even the simplest act of gratitude can change someones entire day take the time to recognize and value the people around you and appreciate those who make a difference in your lives

you will never be able to escape from your heart so its better to listen to what it has to say

there is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort

be yourself no base imitator of another but your best self there is something which you can do better than another listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that do the things at which you are great not what you were never made for

we are all worms but i do believe that i am a glow worm

nothing will work unless you do

the one who falls and gets up is stronger than the one who never tried do not fear failure but rather fear not trying

i want to thank you lord for life and all thats in it

thank you for the day and for the hour and the minute

do not let the roles you play in life make you forget who you are

if you haven’t the strength to impose your own terms upon life then you must accept the terms it offers you

when i find myself in times of trouble mother mary comes to me

speaking words of wisdom let it be

and in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me

speaking words of wisdom let it be

let it be let it be let it be let it be

whisper words of wisdom let it be

and when the broken hearted people living in the world agree

there will be an answer let it be

for though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see

there will be an answer let it be

let it be let it be

and when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me

shine until tomorrow let it be

i wake up to the sound of music mother mary comes to me

speaking words of wisdom let it be

let it be let it be

when you have exhausted all possibilities remember this  you havent

selfrespect is the root of discipline the sense of dignity grows

with the ability to say no to oneself

there aint no journey what dont change you some

stop feeling sorry for yourself and you will be happy

when you judge another you do not define them you define yourself

to this the young man replied the sun is up and the tide is going out if i dont throw them in theyll die

upon hearing this the wise man commented but young man do you not realize that there are miles and miles of beach and there are starfish all along every mile you cant possibly make a difference

before you were born

and were still too tiny for

the human eye to see

you won the race for life

from among  million competitors

and yet

how fast you have forgotten

your strength

when your very existence

is proof of your greatness

you were born a winner

one who defied the odds

by surviving the most gruesome

battle of them all

and now that you are a giant

against smaller numbers

and wider margins

the only walls that exist

are those you have placed in your mind

and whatever obstacles you conceive

exist only because you have forgotten

what you have already

makes the grass shine

the lordly wind loves the weakness

and the lowness of grasses

never brag of being strong

the axe doesnt worry how thick the branches are

it cuts them to pieces but not the leaves

it leaves the leaves alone

if you want something youve never had

when purpose is not known abuse is inevitable

but life without meaning is the torture

life is all about how you handle plan b

plan a is always my first choice

you know the one where

everything works out to be

happily everafter

but more often than not

i find myself dealing with

the upsidedown insideout version

where nothing goes as it should

its at this point that the real

test of my character comes in

do i wallow in self pity and play the victim

or simply shift gears

and make the best of the situation

the choice is all mine

life is all about how you handle plan b

advice is like snow the softer it falls the longer it dwells upon and the deeper it sinks into the mind

thats chess snapped ron youve got to make some sacrifices

take care of your tongue like the way you take care of gold  silver

in a very real sense we have two minds one that thinks and one that feels

i shall sing a sweeter song tomorrow

one must work and dare if one really wants to live

what an utter disgrace it would be to find something truly magic and spend any time at all pretending and trying to convince yourself it is all just an unbelievably orchestrated and beautifully choreographed illusion

remember that things are not always as they appear to be… curiosity creates possibilities and opportunities

like a missing tooth sometimes an absence is more noticeable than a presence

true beauty lies in purity of the heart

distance was a dangerous thing she knew distance changed people

what is she to you anyway

it was the living who ignored the strange and wonderful because life was too full of the boring and mundane

when it gets cold

and it feels like the end

theres no place to go

you know i wont give in

and i remembered something else that makes us human faith the only weapon in our arsenal to battle doubt

i firmly believe that any mans finest hour the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle  victorious

sometimes the best of gods gifts arrive by the shattering of all the window panes

when we lose one we love our bitterest tears are called forth by the memory of hours when we loved not enough

most of the time all you have is the moment and the imperfect love of the people around you

i prefer you to make mistakes in kindness than work miracles in unkindness

if the world is to be healed through human efforts i am convinced it will be by ordinary people people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear

arrogance on the part of the meritorious is even more offensive to us than the arrogance of those without merit for merit itself is offensive

if we were to one day encounter a form of life more powerful and intelligent than our own and it regarded us as we regard fish what would be our argument against being eaten

ive learned one thing you can only really get to know a person after a row only then can you judge their true character

im not going to die im going home like a shooting star

leaders live by choice not by accident

last night the rain spoke to me

photo by shawn nystrand

photo by shawn nystrand

the rain

spoke to me

what joy

to come falling

out of the brisk cloud…

that’s what it said

as it dropped

and vanished…

then it was over

the sky cleared

i was standing

under a tree

the tree was a tree

with happy leaves

and i was myself

and there were stars in the sky

that were also themselves

at the moment

at which moment

my right hand

was holding my left hand

which was holding the tree

which was filled with stars

and the soft rain –

the long and wondrous journeys

still to be ours

i am the master of my fate and the captain of my destiny

books didn’t make me wallow in darkness darkness made me wallow in books

it has been my philosophy of life that difficulties vanish when faced boldly

can you say why america is the greatest country in the world

defeat is not the worst of failures not to have tried is the true failure

stories are like geniesthey can carry us into and though our sorrows sometimes they burn sometimes they dance sometimes they weep sometimes they sing like genies everyone has one like genies sometimes we forget that we do

our stories can set us freewhen we set them free

you get in life what you have the courage to ask for

light is more important than the lantern

the poem more important than the notebook

maybe i hope too much maybe i dream too much or maybe i love too much to just give up on you

im not afraid of dying im afraid ill never get a chance to live

perfection is not attainable but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence

we become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become each day

the home we seek is in eternity

the truth we seek is like a shoreless sea

of which your paradise is but a drop

this ocean can be yours why should you stop

beguiled by dreams of evanescent dew

the secrets of the sun are yours but you

content yourself with motes trapped in its beams

turn to what truly lives reject what seems

which matters more the body or the soul

be whole desire and journey to the whole

in life you need either inspiration or desperation

if you are under the impression you have already perfected yourself you will never rise to the heights you are no doubt capable of

my name is salmon like the fish first name susie i was fourteen when i was murdered

dedicate yourself to what gives your life true meaning and purpose make a positive difference in someones life

what you learn today for no reason at all will help you discover all the wonderful secrets of tomorrow

god send me anywhere only go with me lay any burden on me only sustain me and sever any tie in my heart except the tie that binds my heart to yours

sometimes you just have to jump out the window and grow wings on the way down

everything ends and everything matters

a dog is not considered a good dog because he is a good barker a man is not considered a good man because he is a good talker

stop blaming outside circumstances for your inside chaos

everyones greatest fantasy is to walk away from the life they thinkyou lead

being defeated is often a temporary condition giving up is what makes it permanent

i belive i can fly i believe i can touch the sky

if youre waiting until you feel talented enough to make it youll never make it

there is no rest for the person who has envy and there is no love for the person who has bad manners

i was my own woman

the next step was to find the proper sort of man

there are souls in this world who have the gift of finding joy everywhere and leaving it behind them when they go

no lake so still but it has its wave

no circle so perfect but that it has its blur

i would change things for you if i could as i cant you must take them as they are

we give glory to god when we trust him to do what he has promised to do–especially when all human possibilities are exhausted faith glorifies god that is why god planned for faith to be the way we are justified

live out of your imagination instead of out of your memory

there are moments in every relationship that define when two people start to fall in love

i remove the darth vader house shoes from my satchel and look down at them

you were wearing these during one of those moments

one of the moments i first started to fall in love with you

the way you gave me butterflies that morning

had absolutely nothing to do with anyone else

and everything to do with you

i was falling in love with you that morning

because of you

i take the next item out of the satchel when i pull it out and look up she brings her hands to her mouth in shock

this ugly little gnome

with his smug little grin…

hes the reason i had an excuse to invite you into my house

into my life

you took a lot of aggression out on him over those next few months

i would watch from my window as you would kick him over every time you walked by him

you were so tenacious

that feisty aggressive strongwilled side of you…

the side of you that refused to take crap from this concrete gnome

the side of you that refused to take crap from me

i fell in love with that side of you

because of you

i set the gnome down on the stage and grab the cd

this is your favorite cd

‘layken’s shit’

although now i know you intended for shit to be possessive rather than descriptive

the banjo started playing through the speakers of your car

and i immediately recognized my favorite band

then when i realized it was your favorite band too

the fact that these same lyrics inspired both of us

i fell in love with that about you

that had absolutely nothing to do with anyone else

i fell in love with that about you

because of you

i take a slip of paper out of the satchel and hold it up when i look at her i see eddie slide her a napkin i can’t tell from up here but that can only mean she’s crying

this is a receipt i kept

only because the item i purchased that night was on the verge of ridiculous

chocolate milk on the rocks who orders that

you were different and you didn’t care

you were being you

a piece of me fell in love with you at that moment

because of you

this i hold up another sheet of paper

this i didn’t really like so much

it’s the poem you wrote about me

the one you titled mean

i don’t think i ever told you…

but you made a zero

and then i kept it

to remind myself of all the things i never want to be to you

i pull her shirt from my bag when i hold it into the light i sigh into the microphone

this is that ugly shirt you wear

it doesn’t really have anything to do with why i fell in love with you

i just saw it at your house and thought i’d steal it

only those are fit to live who do not fear to die and none are fit to die who have shrunk from the joy of life and the duty of life both life and death are parts of the same great adventure

the most powerful magic of all is choice

sober gainfully employed and physically secure once again kevin began to relax his confidence slowly returned for the first time since the onset of his blindness he let his guard down and a crack in his carefully constructed veneer formed

and with it hope

nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little

i used to have a sign pinned up on my wall that read only to the extent that we expose ourselves over and over to annihilation can that which is indestructible be found in usit was all about letting go of everything

accept yourself your strengths your weaknesses your truths and know what tools you have to fulfill your purpose

we pencilsketch our previous life so we can contrast it to the technicolor of the moment

no namecalling truly bites deep unless in some dark part of us we believe it if we are confident enough then it is just noise

she could hear some way off her brothers calling to each other in the woods behind the house she hoped desperately that their game wouldnt bring them any closer that they wouldnt scare the birds away

she tried to slow her breathing hoping somehow to make this moment last forever

maybe it just means that love can be stronger than fear

i want to be justice love and the wrath of god all in one

out out brief candle life is but a walking shadowa tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing

id rather die while im living than live while im dead

wake up shake up make up and break up life is all about moving like ant in search of sugar not sand

only when we give joyfully without hesitation or thought of gain can we truly know what love means

have to of course you have to but only because of you harry wont rest until voldemort is finished think now for once if you have never heard of the prophecy what would you do

now dont you understand man universal law

what you throw out comes back to you star

never underestimate those who you scar

cause karma karma karma comes back to you hard

buy a pup and your money will buy

love unflinching that cannot lie

read books care about things get excited try not to be too down on youself enjoy the ever present game of knowing

if you are her man she will talk to you until there just

aren’t any more words left to say encourage you when you’re

at rock bottom and think there just isn’t any way out hold you

in her arms when you’re sick and laugh with you when you’re

up and if you’re her man and that woman loves you—i mean

really loves you—she will shine you up when you’re dusty

encourage you when you’re down defend you even when she’s

not so sure you were right and hang on your every word even

when you’re not saying anything worth listening to

tragedy and adversary are the stones we sharpen our swords against so we can fight new battles

the best form of saying is being

if you dont want a generation of robots fund the arts

we are the bibles the world is reading we are the creeds the world is needing we are the sermons the world is heeding

align yourself with people that you can learn from people who want more out of life people who are stretching and searching and seeking some higher ground in life

shoot for the moon because even if you miss you miss youll land in the stars

a real scientist solves problems not wails that they are unsolvable

my sun sets to rise again

were miserable because we think that we are mere individuals alone with our fears and flaws and resentment and mortality

everything that had happened was shockingly beautiful enough to make you crazy

this is not the end this is not even the beginning of the end this is just perhaps the end of the beginning

when you get up in the morning you have two choices  either to be happy or to be unhappy just choose to be happy

only one life ’twill soon be past

only what’s done for christ will last

the greatest thing about dreams is they don’t expire they can lay dormant for years and when you pull them out and dust them off they shine like new

dont count your owls before they are delivered

when she listened to songs that she loved on the radio something stirred inside her a liquid ache spread under her skin and she walked out of the world like a witch

your mother won a special reward she told me because everyone had a head in her pictures we all applauded

there is only one who is all powerful and his greatest weapon is love

remember your humanity and forget the rest

i change the world the world changes me

failing sucks but its better than the alternative

he knew sometimes some fear can be good when you are afraid things are going to get worse if you dont do something it can prompt you into action but it is not good when you are afraid that it keeps you from doing anything

just because fate doesnt deal you the right cards it doesnt mean you should give up it just means you have to play the cards you get to their maximum potential

whether you know or not you are the infinite potential of love peace and joy

let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate

the race is long  to finish first first you must finish

there are many people who can do big things but there are very few people who will do the small things

stop giving your life away to other people

i wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself like the colored arrows from a fourth of july rocket

god made the world round so we would never be able to see too far down the road

even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness it is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity

do not try to explain feelings live everything intensely and treasure what you feel as a gift from god

i think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation

the universe was here before you and it will go on after you the only way it will remember you is if you do something worthy of remembrance

the heart of wisdom is tolerance

i have a dream is your dream very big no well is it very grand not either neither neither what is it then it is very shiny

for your past for your flaws and ultimately for your stress i judge no one whom i’ve met along the way because in a sense we were all wounded in our own ways

one day in my shoes and a day for me in your shoes the beauty of travel lies in the ease and willingness to be more open

your humans slaughter each other because of the color of your skin or your faith or your plitics  or for no reason at all  too many of you hate as easily as you draw breath  magneto

andi think thats what life is all about actually

about children and flowers

the life given us by nature is short but the memory of a wellspent life is eternal

you dont have to make something that people call art living is an artistic activity there is an art to getting through the day

whoever you are or whatever it is that you do when you really want something its because that desire originated in the soul of the universe its your mission on earth

a daydreamer is prepared for most things

we are what we are neither a good or as bad as others paint us and what we are doesnt change how truly we feel only how free we are to follow those feelings

at times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lighted the flame within us

it is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our lives that we must draw our strength to live and our reasons for living

stop comparing yourself to others always strive to improve yourself to become better today than you were yesterday to serve those around you and the world

cake is happiness if you know the way of the cake you know the way of happiness if you have a cake in front of you you should not look any further for joy
