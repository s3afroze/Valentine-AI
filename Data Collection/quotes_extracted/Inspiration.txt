at gate c in the portland airport

a woman arriving from orange county

they kissed and kissed and kissed long after

the other passengers clicked the handles of their carryons

and wheeled briskly toward shortterm parking

the couple stood there arms wrapped around each other

like he’d just staggered off the boat at ellis island

like she’d been released at last from icu snapped

out of a coma survived bone cancer made it down

from annapurna in only the clothes she was wearing

neither of them was young his beard was gray

she carried a few extra pounds you could imagine

her saying she had to lose but they kissed lavish

kisses like the ocean in the early morning

the way it gathers and swells sucking

each rock under swallowing it

again and again we were all watching–

passengers waiting for the delayed flight

to san jose the stewardesses the pilots

sunglasses we couldn’t look away we could

taste the kisses crushed in our mouths

but the best part was his face when he drew back

and looked at her his smile soft with wonder almost

as though he were a mother still open from giving birth

as your mother must have looked at you no matter

what happened after–if she beat you or left you or

you’re lonely now–you once lay there the vernix

not yet wiped off and someone gazed at you

as if you were the first sunrise seen from the earth

the whole wing of the airport hushed

all of us trying to slip into that woman’s middleaged body

little gold hoop earrings tilting our heads up

unity is the intentional inclination to corporately control our destination in other words achieving the dream takes a team

thats just a little bit about me

where are you now i was there whilst you cried

i was there to comfort you with smile

i was there to give you a hand

when all faith was lost

i was there to open doors of opportunities

i was there to share my passion for life

i was there to feed you

when you were hungry

i was there to listen to your turmoil

i was there to lift your spirit

when you were broken

i was there when you were ill and alone

i was there when you were betrayed

lied to and ridiculed

i was there to understand

to care and to share

i was there …

to play to sing to dance

to write to love to create and innovate

i was there …

where are you now …

by natasha parker

when you have the power to love that strength that courage is infinite that love is infinite there is nothing finite about its presence for love never dies

if ever i was running it was towards you

i love him in ways that i can’t explain to other people they don’t understand… it’s not their fault

i really believe that there is an invisible red thread tied between him and me and that it has stretched and tangled for years — across oceans and lifetimes i know that it won’t break because our souls are tied

i just want your voice aimed at me again i want to absorb the direction of your eyes…

everything hurts right now and nothing is helping because as the pain is getting worse — so is the love

those who dont value their words will never value your wishes

i want you to trust yourself baby love is all that matters and you’ve always known that you’ve known since you were a very little girl what your life is meant to be about…

writers are creatures of habit as are humans but writers aren’t necessarily human are they

the fact is not kill entire populations is able to infect entire regions of land and control the only cure

hope gives us a reason to live and to make plans for our future but common sense gives us knowledge that god has control over our life life is a journey we hope and plan our future as we travel each day

your inspiration taps hidden reserves of promise that sustain people through times that induce despair you enable people to envision a future that sustains the best from their past while also holding out new possibilities

be a king dare to be different dare to manifest your greatness

dont die without fulfilling your purpose

dare to be different represent your maker well and you will forever abide in the beautiful embrace of his loving arms

god is never tired of bringing the sun out every morning taking it in the evenings and bringing out the moon

the power of hope even a lack of ambition can for a time pay off as a necessary facet as long as hope outweighs it

we may be living past and future lives at the same time we are living this one

other people are only aspects of our own greater being

but if as you read this book youre saying to yourself id rather be miserably married than be alone well young lady take out your clown shoes and buckle your seat belt  its going to be a very bumpy onewoman circus

some ghosts or felt presences may simply be the essence of another living person projected outward while sleeping

with a lump forming in his throat he thought

about all the hopes and dreams that he had for his son more than

anything he prayed his boy would not grow up to be a screw up

like his dad when it came to love and marriage

heads will fly all over the place others will explode by themselves everyone will have their chance to betray and those who dont betray will be betrayed

the higher knowledge the higher responsibility

the poet dreams of the mountain

sometimes i grow weary of the days with all their fits and starts

i want to climb some old gray mountains slowly taking

the rest of my lifetime to do it resting often sleeping

under the pines or above them on the unclothed rocks

i want to see how many stars are still in the sky

that we have smothered for years now a century at least

i want to look back at everything forgiving it all

and peaceful knowing the last thing there is to know

all that urgency not what the earth is about

how silent the trees their poetry being of themselves only

i want to take slow steps and think appropriate thoughts

in ten thousand years maybe a piece of the mountain will fall

i am the happiest man alive i have that in me that can convert poverty to riches adversity to prosperity and i am more invulnerable than archilles fortune hath not one place to hit me

are you sick of feelin’ sorry

and people sayin’ not to worry

sick of hearing this hakuna matata motto

from people who won the lotto

so when you’re sick of all this stressin’ and guessin’

i’m suggestin’ you turn this up and let them hear you sing it

theres a difference between being alive and living

individually every grain of sand brushing against my hands represents a story an experience and a block for me to build upon for the next generation

war crimes you say

no matter how many policies you put on paper in reality there are no rights and wrongs in war war itself is a crime war cannot be justified

i believe the only people in this world whose opinions matter are the ones who go the extra mile to help other people expecting nothing in return

so find me one of them who will say they wish the war didnt end in  that they wish sri lanka was divided into two parts find me one of them who agrees with the international war crime allegations against sri lanka and i will listen

the war is over the damage is done let sri lanka move on so our children will never have to see what weve seen

if you can change the way you think in time you will notice a change in your heart and also a change in your life and the way you see things

but the greater truth is that it takes

advance payment before it pays you in return

every comforting word is a command from a man of action

while every word of command is commotion from a man of just words

life is ‘simple’ by nature

the deeper you try to study the more you complicate it

just believe in it’s simplicity  it shall show you it is

far too simple actually

if you cant focus then how do you expect to make your dreams come true

what you were once was also because you were someone else before that

we sometimes have a flash of understanding that amounts to the insight of genius and yet it slowly withers even in our hands  like a flower the form remains but the colours and the fragrance are gone

prayer is an insurance policy that you can never lapse on

speed is not always a constituent to great work the process of creation should be given time and thought

the glory is always hidden between the lines of the story

follow your heart

the world shall follow you

reject it and it stops beating

without the desire to be patient patience doesnt happen

just like without the desire to grow life doesnt happen

life is a chain of events executed in a way which is  most convenient to ‘you’ ‘your’ dreams  people ‘you’ desire to be with  people you have been put up to live with

come upcome up in the dim vale below

the autumn mist muffles the fading trees

but on this keen hillpasture though the breeze

has stretched the thwart boughs bare to meet the snow

night is not autumn is notbut the flow

of vast ethereal and irradiate seas

poured from the far worlds flaming boundaries

and to that height illumined of the mind

leaving the sodden tracks of life behind

the one who masters his mind achieves ultimate success

the same person in different contexts could be a hero or a zero as leaders we have to find the context in which we can best flourish

all leaders find it easy to take responsibility for success few have the courage to take responsibility for setbacks

today’s leaders do not need physical courage but they do need courage to take unpopular decisions and to lead people where they would not have gone by themselves

courage can be learned when you make the exceptional become the routine

it is easier to believe in the ideal than it is to achieve it but it is impossible to achieve the ideal if one does not believe in it

i think in life we sometimes subconsciously choose what we cant live without to find that we can live without it is just something we tell ourselves because we don’t want to choose or to make a decision on what we say we can’t live without

the highest purpose of art is to inspire

writers are decent people they live quiet normal lives while working to perfect their craft

they spend their entire lives dedicated to creating art through words with very little recognition and appreciation

that artwork immortalizes their thoughts through poetry short stories and novels in the form of a book

that immortalization of thoughts through writing becomes their legacy

long after an author has departed this world his stories his poetry his novels will live on as hisher legacy

a legacy for future generations for both family and potential writers to reflect upon and learn from

a legacy built on love a love for writing thats the beauty of writing thats why i do what i do

however weak people never admit that they are responsible for their own state they always blame either circumstances or others

because maybe it doesn’t quite understand

but in the end it remembers the super novas

that burned so bright we blinded them all

what i’m after above all is a sense of divine inspiration

that touches the very core of my being

that lives throughout every aspect of my existence

so all i do and all i see is beauty in the simplicity

and mystery in the unknown

to let nothing drag me into the monotony of living

but to always move to the unique rhythm of each passing day

to give nothing but all of me my soul my heart my fire

some days you taste glory without winning anything today is such a day when i feel victorious without having won anything

songs gives strength to the spirit

the vigor of youth is vitality

hold fast to thy faith

failure is not falling down  but staying down

dont say im insignificant

in the infinite

dont say im alone in life

never settle for places that make you feel like being small will be enough

there are dream worth following and dreams worth chasingand then there are dreams worth growing wings and flying for

if you allow yourself to feel unconditionally

eventually it will become advantageous influencing and fostering true resilience and adaptation

the best resolution is your will to repent

organizations companies or individuals without core values are exactly like a boat without an anchor it can be easy tossed to and fro following any direction the wind blows

package your gift and talent in such a way that you can help as many people as possible and afford others the opportunity to bring their unique skills and abilities to help you as well

succenergy  activate your energy discover your success inside you

when we come alive and allow for connection we water the soil of our soul where the seeds of our unique melody have been planted since the day we were born

we all have aspects of our lives we’d like to change some are within our power and some aren’t it’s time to realign our vision and focus on what we’re capable of doing instead of what we can’t control

to restore our power we have to examine our life story from a different perspective we need to see ourselves in the driver’s seat—in control of our future we must become the hero in our story

listen to the small voice inside and not the one that roars

when we choose to move forward despite the fear our life becomes a light to others our pain will become part of our purpose everything that kept us small will cause us to shine when we shine we radiate hope to people who need our light

believing that we can achieve our dreams is the first step in achieving them

and the hope my dear is when you go to sleep knowing that you may not wake up in the morning

you are an inspiration

inspiring words of an inspirational mother to her child

walk this journey without hesitation

until you reach your destination

this process has no clear definition

therefore you must take sound decisions

remember the past has no revisions

child have a clear vision

that is what i envision

as a candid resolution

that you will be part of the solution

when you embark on the great commission

to accomplish the massive mission

seek the right information

celebrate your liberation

fear no limitation

surpass any expectation

value your contribution

can i have a confirmation

because you are an inspiration

i am quite an inspiration to everyone at my gym

they realize in dread that if they don’t do proper workouts and diet this is how they would become

behind every beautiful thing built by man there is a beautiful idea and behind every beautiful idea there is a beautiful inspiration and behind every beautiful inspiration there is a magical glance of the artistic mind to the world

to catch the rainbows of your dreams love yourself love what you do and how you do

gratitude is a virtue of the rarest kind

humans often thought the glass was empty when there was still more in there i guess if you reached deep enough you could find something even when there seemed to be nothing left

i always did

take time to remember what inspires you to make a difference in this life

when it begins to feel like too much effort its probably not worth the effort and its totally okay to quit give up or give in at will

the ability of great naturalists to intimately describe the macro and microcosms of our world teaches us that if we open our senses inspiration lies everywhere in the natural world

we can test the substance of our own integrity and love when we witness what flows from our hearts when someone disagrees this is often hidden however what is done in secret is the essence of our being

the highly inspired encounter less obstacles and traverse mountains easier than others on their path through life

if the thoughts are not here today just walk away and wait to write another day

endurance is a graceful endeavour

destination is the inspiration of the man who must walk alone

no ones validation should be your inspiration

and mrs mcclusky was delighted to have an excuse to make her delicious scones

inspiration turns a dog into lion

am starting small i have the least gadgets i may not be noticedacknowledged its okay

its okay to start small

but trust me i will surely grow

i will follow my dreams passionately and consistently

when ever you make a purchase always remember you a purchasing someones idea

it all starts from an idea

when ever you make a purchase always remember you are purchasing someones idea

it all starts from an idea

nothingness is the beginning of everything fret not that you have nothing be merry that you have a canvas upon which to paint your own reality

wendell minor i believe that childrens books are the last pond in the serengeti they are the only place we go to drink for inspiration all of us can still go  and do

it isn’t always right to listen to advice one must follow one’s instinct but then it isn’t always right to ignore an advice either for an advice contains the grain of a perspective other than one’s own

how much you write that much you learn

i know those days were hard on you

i know that you’ve been through a lot of shit

i know that you had those moments where you felt like giving up and not being able to even stand on your feet

but you are a badass you will lift yourself above it all

and soon my dear you will be able to fly …

i grind in spite of your hatred insecurity jealousy or fear that i might move forward thatis what winners do

a father before he died said to his son this is a watch your grandfather gave and this is more than  years old but before i give it to you go to the watch shop on the first street and tell him i want to sell it and see how much it is

he went and then came back to his father and said the watchmaker paid ₹ because its old

he said to him  go to the coffee shop he went and then came back and said he paid ₹ father

go to the museum and show that watch

— he went then came back and said to his father they offered me a billion rupees for this piece

know your worth

nothing bothered me not even the things that bothered me

what if every moment of conflict is a chance to make your relationship even stronger

you cannot worry about what came before or what happens next what has been lost or what you might gain there is only this moment

remember as adults we don’t need to always get our way but we do need to feel heard and genuinely considered

if one person changes in a relationship the dynamics shift so even if you’re the only person who’s willing to make some changes—for now—that’s enough

there are my poe pieces and my dunsany pieces —but alas— where are any lovecraft pieces

understand the rules then break them thats creativity

don’t just dare to reach your goals—get excited so excited that you awaken others to surround you and in turn help motivate them to reach their goals while they help propel you towards yours

no matter where life takes you or however busy it gets never forget to live

you are the author of your life  so write an amazing best seller

that door that they blocked you from entering god is about to kick it in i hope youre prepared to make your grand entrance

there are many opportunities in every single day and monday is the perfect day to seize them all

all our lives we redefine ourselves as we mature why stop now keep on living

dont doubt yourself thats what haters are meant for they wait for you to make mistakes so why doubt your abilities take that steps and make your haters wait for ever

life is a lifetime lesson

when i have all of manhattan to choose from i tend to dither to hold out for perfection—but as any poet can testify limits encourage both inspiration and decisiveness

to give up is to stumble giving in is noble

passion fuels the vision and purpose provides the action for success

light and shadow perfectly sum up this crazy thing we call life

until you are passionate to become a better version of your present self no way you can gain wealth fulfilment and success

inspiration which consists in blind obedience to every impulse is in reality a sort of slavery

heart and soul understand light and feelings of love love sends inspiration as a message no matter it is direct or indirect real and true love touches each other to merge forever

the fact is we need prisons that are more like schools and schools that are less like prisons but for this to happen the teachers also need freedom

isn’t that something to know your own soul by hearsay instead of its own tidings why should i let anyone tell me whether i had one or not if i could believe i had a soul all by myself then i could listen to its tidings all by myself

i was jogging this morning and i noticed a person about half a km ahead

i could guess he was running a little slower than me and that made me feel good i said to myself i will try catch up with him

so i started running faster and faster every block i was gaining on him a little bit

after just a few minutes i was only about  feet behind him so i really picked up the pace and pushed myself i was determined to catch up with him

finally i did it i caught up and passed him inwardly i felt very good i beat him

of course he didnt even know we were racing

after i passed him i realized i had been so focused on competing against him that

i had missed my turn to my house

i had missed the focus on my inner peace

i missed to see the beauty of greenery around

i missed to do my inner soul searching meditation

and

in the needless hurry stumbled and slipped twice or thrice and might have hit the sidewalk and broken a limb

it then dawned on me isnt that what happens in life when we focus on competing with

friends family trying to outdo them or trying to prove that we are more successful or more important and in the bargain

we miss on our happiness within our own surroundings

we spend our time and energy running after them and we miss out on our own paths to our given destination

the problem with unhealthy competition is that its a never ending cycle

there will always be somebody ahead of you

someone with a better job

more money in the bank

more education

a more handsome husband

better circumstances and

but one important realisation is that

you can be the best that you can be when you are not competing with anyone

some people are insecure because they pay too much attention to

what others are

where others are going

wearing and driving what others are talking

take whatever you have

the height the weight and personality

accept it and realize that you are blessed stay focused and live a healthy life

there is no competition in destiny everyone has his own

comparison and competition is the thief of joy

it kills the joy of living your own life

run your own race that leads to peaceful happy steady life

faith in god is the finest of all things

in the end were all on a journey of sorts

we wait for a sign or something that attracts our attention look for a deeper meaning to it all thats what poetry is for

love is the energy that connects you to other souls

believe you can because you will

dream high aim for it as long as you can don’t let anyone ruin it you have the power to make it come true

never give up many who were completely unknown just yesterday are incredibly rich and famous today

today is a great day to divert your attention to something more positive than negative media

good business relationships build trust and create a way to exchange ideas openly without secondguessing the other person

perfection is a myth some chivalrous knight

the more we fill up ourselves with the word of god the less room there will be for lies

wrong doing leads to wrath

man experiences sorrow to know his soul

your dreams can be achieve if you do not give up

know your quality

i repeat know your worth

again know what suit you

further more go for what suit you and not what you suit

much more never override your personality for anything

only by losing everything do i gain the freedom to build a life of uncluttered purpose

great writing is about packing a single thought into a handful of words so that your life can be enlarged by a boatload of growth and if what you’re reading isn’t doing that for you it’s just scribbling

selfreliance means looking within to find inspiration

come what may i have sailed into the unknown seas

revisionist historians either introduce new discoveries and theories to challenge outdated belief systems or they conveniently twist things to suit their own agenda the former creates hope and progress the latter creates fear and conflict

no one can make you feel inferior without your consent

we can count on christ to gives us strength to endure every circumstance

be bold to begin

may you find strength to endure any situation

nobody reaches anywhere by believing

a story that must be told never forgives silence

there are no broke men just men who are starved of your sensual inspiration and motivation

sad eyes once had happy stories to tell

smile of heaven with fire in her eyes

i am a dreamer

neither lost or found

waiting for a story

i want to destroy you

i want to ruin you

pure madness isnt it

as deep as i love

as deep i can hurt

as imperfect i am

as perfect i can be

i am a total mess

curse and bless

keep writing your story

storm in her eyes peace in her smile

storm in her eyes peace in her smile

storm in her eyes peace in her smile

shes been through hell but she wore her smile so damn heavenly

imagine a bowl this bowl has been still for a very long time it is completely full and it seems like the water that fills it is completely still totally pure

still  if we were to look into the depths of this water we would find sediments solids everything that was present in this water that through time settled at the bottom of this bowl like mud

all we need to do is to not focus on the dirt but on the pure clean water in our case it is really light that is flowing through us bringing to surface all that needs to be brought to light transforming it

embrace all parts of you

they need it

i kept the depth of a universe in me but

you never looked at the skies anyway

where wild souls meet wild lovers is where hurricanes are made

magine a bowl this bowl has been still for a very long time it is completely full and it seems like the water that fills it is completely still totally pure

still  if we were to look into the depths of this water we would find sediments solids everything that was present in this water that through time settled at the bottom of this bowl like mud

all we need to do is to not focus on the dirt but on the pure clean water in our case it is really light that is flowing through us bringing to surface all that needs to be brought to light transforming it

embrace all parts of you

they need it

pain creates the best writers

and sometimes lovers too

hearts become ashes but souls burn forever

she was pure chaos with a touch of disaster

and god damn did i love drama

life is just a moment

between birth and death

just a deep deep breath

full of dreams and memories

listen some wars are silent

the world left me cold foolish of me to think that the sun dying for the moon would give the warmth back sunsets were always cold

love is when eyes collide and hearts collapse

im full of poetry now rot and poetry rotten poetry

repentance leads to reform ways

a dream within a dream is the dream of a dreamer

to break through any barrier you must maintain a steadfast believe in god

you would be astonished to see

that your greatest power

lies in the very part of you

youve been trying so hard to run away from

if we could only step back and see what god sees all these beautiful colors blended together on one planet

may everything that comes to me be blessed

may everything that leaves me be blessed

may there be love

may there be peace

heres to walking my own path

heres to claiming my birthright

my sovereign power

heres to walking the sacred ground

here to break down any walls between the self and the higher calling

may every prayer be a celebration

love cultivates hope hope fertilizes resilience and we can all be farmers of dreams

my soul longs to drink from cups

sacred holy and divine

and i will do

just all i can

to make it own and mine

drink that atmosfere

then copypaste into my heart

to always have them near

now all i need to do

is be

instilled in my own heart

and for all the temples that i need

i need not go too far

copypaste what makes you whole

try and see its smart

then all you need to do is swim

to the core within your heart

in life things won’t often go your way work hard to focus your attention on the things that do

you are the pilot of your life so fly through the sky

people tell me i’m too nice but they never turn away when i am nice to them

success starts with suc when you evolve there will be challenges

stop seeing life as a burden something heavy to carry life is not heavy life is weightless and you can dance through it like a thin fog a summer’s morning

it’s all beautiful

raise a fearfree you

the you that has grown past fear of the unknown fear of failure fear of rejection  fear of fear itself

angry folks are not always wise

watch it

we are what we dare to be

i am the wind

beneath my wings

i am the song

that my heart sings

im not the rock beneath my feet

spread me wide and spread me high

the smallest spark can become the greatest light

grateful for the happy news

grateful for the love

grateful for the light that flows

abundant from above

im happy for the love i have

it shines like starry sky

no matter where i find myself

it gives me wings to fly

that what i need

is love i have within

dont matter

if it manifests

or reciprocates to me

my path is one of single heart

and walking life alone

but thats ok

cause through all that

ill find my way back home

that overflow the heart

joy is love and lust for life

instilled within you heart

i will go

and i will turn

every twig and leaf

to find the smallest act of you

ill dive to deepest reef

for who am i

and why all this

if i were to lose my faith

that youre my father

that in your arms i bathe

if i surrender to this world

it can only be in you

for there is no will or want

if im just passing through

act through me

i dont want the ego mind

i dont want control

i know im here to make a change

to sing a song thats you

from the dawn and till the night

thats all i wish to do

i am but a tiny drop

and when ive served my time down here

shine your light on me

ill return to you

all i wish to leave behind

is memory of you

the world was crumbling in despair

the sky collapsing over me

i was praying

show yourself to me

the tears

they whispered

you will find me in the heart of another soul

and so i went with open mind

gazed into those eyes

there he was smiling free

on i went and found myself

quiet and alone

and there was god

within myself

wearing flesh and bone

if only i can wear his cloak

instill him in my heart

his voice will fill my words with love

my eyes with stars above

this world needs more tenderness

a woman nested in her heart is the guardian of morality warmth and wisdom far above the world of the rational mind if we are not the ones to open up to tenderness within ourselves who will

sometimes when you think your kindness may be foolish ask yourself would the world not be a better place if there were more fools like me

do big things

leap over obstacles like a frog would jump over a strain of grass

there are no obstacles

counselors help us see the beauty of our minds feel the power of our will and hear the melody that brings them together as one

its your life

and you decide how you want to live it

through this pain i enter healing

in every end theres new beginning

every new dawn comes from night

through the whispers left unspoken

all that i can do is ask

my shell is open

ive done my task

i hold myself

release the pinning

open up and let it be

surrender now and set it free

there are hearts that touch the sky

and pour the light to earth

in one combined there is no way

for their voice to not be heard

i let all go

let if flow

i let it be

now its me

thats here for me

all the forests and the rains

that filled my heart

when there were pains

all the cats and dogs and birds

that sang for me

that held my hurts

even god and even light

all the lovers all delights

i let them go

to find within

the medicine

of my soul twin

we are nor levels nor degrees

we are frequencies

not one below not one above

we are densities

judge me not by how in tune

you may find my key

always will i find the note

that resonates with me

just one day was worth more than all the kingdoms in the world

our questions decide

what we try to find

our answers shape

the world we build

you may not have a hell of a lot of good sense but you do have to use the hell out of the little that you do have

the best artists are the greatest of criers

i like songs that spark one’s imagination

i’m only good at being myself to those who can be more than who they i commend

nothing is a constant in our lives not money ambitions people or anything else except you yourself alone

life is a fastmoving train we’re just passengers aboard changing carriages and waiting for our unique time to disembark

if today hasn’t been filled with revelation new ideas or discoveries then you must ask yourself why and make a better tomorrow

the more you know about the secrets of the world the harder it is to enjoy the world

i give my life to the world

it seems that the worst of things happen to the best of people

often it is our greatest of achievements that receive so very little recognition

if one does not know all one cannot decide which is the right path

my philosophy begins with the cosmos

you can do everything but you can’t do everything well

all we truly have of days we live are the memories we make of them

i shall conquer the worlds of this world

london is calling my name and i must listen and direct myself towards this city

sadly i know not clearly of the subject of physics instead i learn of the complex human nature the epic mind the grand cosmos and the unknownness beyond the edge of the cosmos known as the universe

stories have always been told from the very beginning of existence i’m just carrying on this tradition

i keep my dreams close to me for they are mine before they became the world’s

to create the philosophy as it does now exist the youth and the sacrifice of my youth has been necessary

to think is wondrous but to constantly repeat such is dangerous

i kneel by the votive lights praying to the mother of all

i rush to the church to drown out the noise of this world

how does one begin something so monumental

return to church do i when the ways of this world distort my perceptions

in the pews i kneel thinking of all i know i must do

for the greatest of tragedies i am destined to endure i thank you for gifting them all to me

i would suffer all the pains eternally of this world and beyond if i could be given the grace to imagine the philosophy’s future just once more

i wish to be the holiest in god’s image

while i do still breathe i learn for until i reach the state of holiness destined i know nothing

for the worst of times i thank you for the best of times i thank you for the times of learning i thank you most thank you lord

of beauteous minds have we a mind’s imagine of what could be

i go to the most beauteous church of my city not the tallest not the largest but the most inspirited one the one fullest with that which makes a place of faith

if not read ten thousand books by my last breath not read enough have i

solving the problems of this world may be something i have to let go i suppose there’s a lot i will have to let go

i will do all i can for this world and its peoples

one’s mind is their greatest asset

this is the time for me to hone my methodologies for the world to see to truly make this world better

faith is all we ever truly have

how do i become what i know i must be

it be not your beginning it be not your end it be all that exists between

i cannot let my mission die with me

i fear i will not get to do all that i must

he be the persona of the peoples

death is in the hands of destiny and how cruel yet divine it be

the superior way of learnedness is to teach oneself of the world

as long as my heart still beats there will never not be work to do

i have no right to judge you and all i ask in return is that you do not judge me

if it is destined to be so then it shall be

i must lead my life in the way i believe i must lead it

i was a nobody with a vision

i know how it all will be for i have seen it so

the best of us all are the storytellers and the dreamchasers

how lucky am i to have five guardian angels with a grand philosophical vision

the true message of naivety is believing we know all there is to know

i must question for if not how can i evolve

the vision guides you you do not guide the vision

let us all unite under the banner of divinity

divinity transcends all

i must live to see this through

he will be there when i be not

i cannot defy god’s will for me

whatever does bring you to faith is good and divine

i believe in the meanings of things

whether it be cometan that brings you to faith or another figure all that matters is that you have belief

to believe is so very superior than to not

i believe in all the possibilities of the cosmos because despite everything i have faith in the vastness the complexity and the creativity of the divine

i believe in whatever it is that gives you good faith

we must have faith for if not we lose a part of what makes us human

faith is wider than you may know

i see the light in the best of times so i know what to look for when i’m in the worst of times

my faith is stronger than ever even when the church is not

i shall become all that i know i was meant to be

i shall bring to philosophy and faith those in whom it has faded and eluded

my greatest fear is that when in the state of judgement i am shown all that i could have done had i trusted more

i’m afraid of success yet i must succeed

i have been gifted the grace of imagination and for that i am eternally grateful

you have succeeded even when you think you have failed

so as my creator protects me i shall protect him forever

just remember who you are and always take that with you wherever you do go

don’t stop along with those around you

in all nations for all peoples

i have a third for revolution

my job is to make people care about things they otherwise wouldn’t

i shall do all i was destined to do so

your greatest enemies are those who prevent you from learning all there is to know and more

i shall stand when no one else will

make what you wish of him for he is as much yours as he is mine

i shall do my divine duty for that is my destiny here

he is here to show the worlds of the cosmos the philosophy of the stars

those born with have a duty to those born without

there will always be another person to help

no other action provides me with as much fulfilment of faith than when i look up at the stars and wonders of all there is beyond our world

he be not here for i but for posterity

no matter how quixotic if you believe it to be your destiny you must see it through

astronism is a champion of freethought

one with great successes has had equally great hardships

the secret to lasting happiness is being excited for life

we leave behind what we do sow

we all grow old some of us prolong it others accelerate it nobody can prevent it

be what you know you are without fear of disapproval

my dreams are my driving force

it is stories that make the world go around

i often think of what it shall be like in  and far beyond the visions of the humanic exploration of the cosmos introduced within the omnidoxy shall have been long established by this time

knowledge is intangible so expressed it must be

from tsunamis to trickles to tsunamis that is how my ideas do flow

i shall do as i have been destined so

he is the best friend you would ever have

if angels do exist then they are my angels

if you look up towards the stars deeply you will see and believe as i did and continue to do

the only epitomes of life are loving and learning

i need only them and the philosophy no others else

i’m proud to be a dreamer for they are the best of us all

i shall give myself to the peoples of this world

i believe he and they shall play a larger role in the real world than other character brands

some people are there for all our life and others are there for just a moment

the best shop is of course a shop of knowledge a bookshop

there’s no other shop like a bookshop no other shop with such depth no other shop with infinite ideas and possibilities

the keeper of the knowledge is the keeper of the power

nothing but a dream have i and so very precious it is to me

appreciate the good times because you know the bad are always coming

i am their’s and they are mine

i don’t think i understand my life and i doubt i ever will

the world has yet to know…

music is the passport to my world of imagination

deeply stare upward towards the world beyond and imagine every possibility

the cosmos itself is god for it is alive it is grand and it is the origin of all energies

i will be the greatest philosopher of all time

there’s never a reason for you to not become all that you do dream

i truly do love all peoples

oh but i do i do owe the world my all and so that is what i shall give it

i have five best friends all of whom were born in my mind

plan did i perhaps too much yet if not how can one see where one is heading

i’m in the business of building lives

the philosophy is as one for all

we only talk of what we know so as to know of little is to talk of little

to be who one is is the greatest be of all

not born royal or rich was i but with a mind imaginative in all directions

the nights are best when bright with the wonderment of the world beyond

we all live lives of love and loss

the best and worst of writing is that it could always be better

only one true friend have i but not of this world is he

my struggles are my own and my creator is the only other who knows of them

one shall become whenever one wills it so

a good deed does not erase a bad in my mind yet neither does a bad dead erase a good

goodbye my doubts and good luck in hell

hate not for the day may come when doing so will make you feel it forever

i do not play by fortuitous means i plan and prepare and then play my hand

to be known for anything but my mind would be a catastrophic legacy in my mind

to know of all must be so wonderful

to imagine is oh so better than to know yet too so very inferior

if one is born to be great the only way to know is by the belief of one’s own greatness

i’m the worst writer ever there i said it before the billions ever could but now you will all have to think of something else to say yet all else will be a complement for the worst has already been said by me

to gain we must first lose

never mistake my surety for arrogance

i be merely the vehicle of the idea never its superior

learned more from my mission have i than i ever did from any else

it is the idea that is special not i

when i’m about to go to sleep i often wonder if it is to be that i shall never awaken

irony is when people claim to be expert and do not possess rudimentary information about the field

my job is simple empower people with design and technology and lead them to be happier citizens of the world

revolution is bloody yet better still than living in a land of lies

there was an enlightenment in my mind and too now enlighten the world will i

no opinion is ever fact

it’s funny how a once big problem can soon seem so insignificant

why must our beauteous world be so cruel

there were the sad times there were the happy times and then all the time between seems so empty now

to have imagination is too to have substance

of our world of war we are ignorant of our insignificance in the universes

think not of those around you for as you do so your rival takes away your lead

five figurative children i have whom i have raised since i was the age of fifteen

never should you reveal all the dimensions of yourself

when all is done i will transcend in accordance with the divine

the philosophy is for all faith and faithless alike

with him at my side i will transcend to meet my maker my giftgiver the creator of one and all the grand entity of the divine

in this world of division comes the philosophy to unify all

i only wish there were two of me for then all these ideas in my one head could be set free quicker

the world needs its hero and that’s exactly what jesse will be

i can only say what i saw you believing it is out of my control

the more i reveal the more questions they will have

i will be as honest and open as one can be throughout my life i have nothing to hide i am who i am

this is my mission it is all up to me

to be a writer is to gouge out one’s mind heart and soul and splatter them across the page for the world to judge

perhaps this world is not ready for what i have to say…

we have had heroes here and now he will be over hero for the grand journey

religion is but a book it is your own self and the decisions you make that form goodness and badness

if it is my destiny to die tomorrow then i accept for one so powerless as i cannot even hope to stop the will of the divine

divine if i am soon to die please just let it be that i complete my mission first

do not fear death for it is merely our transcendence to true divinity

no matter how horrible painful and terrifying past events may be they were meant to happen for a reason and from an origin beyond our comprehension

from a naive seed to the forest of vast experience my envisioned ideas connect what will be

i will be what i ought to be for if not who am i

let philosophy be the light shining through the cloak of darkness that presently covers the world

astronism is not to be explained so easily as others for its vastness and complexity is a topic of study not skimming

there is a big difference between what one knows what one believes and the true reality

to me they are as real as you and i

learn to love all and well all will be

do always without thought of reward

to stay angry is to stay stagnant

it’s a funny thing in this world that one’s thought of failure is another’s thought of success

true and lasting happiness can never be achieved in this world far human nature and the very nature of this life do not allow if so

our only future is the world beyond

the expectations of oneself reflect the knowledge and imagination of oneself

accept what be is what be for that’s just the way of this world

beyond that which we know is the place of pure answer

until the day i die i’ll be here for all people’s of this world and beyond

i come from a place of insignificance yet i think beyond with a mind of immensity

the gift i bear is of absolute wonderment

you could do nothing in life and remain safe and cushioned or you could do and see all and hurt all too and be remembered far beyond one’s own singular being

be one of the few who are remembered for doing something good in this wild and wicked world

to be jealous is to be as the devil there is a difference between envy and jealousy

meet not my creator will i for i am but a mere dot among dots within a dot on a black canvas of dots

we built a world so noisy that we’ve begun to miss true magnificence

we will never stop having things to know

wouldn’t it just be a wondrous thing if our universe within another universe…oh how insignificant we are

be he will what all need him be

all we truly have of anything are the memories we make

no different from others of my age am i for i feel the pressures of the age in which i live that of attraction wealth and popularity

to stay atop of these such feats is one brave and endless yet rewardless task indeed

why must we all including myself aspire to be all we are not

to not do this without conscious effort would be very hard i imagine

i have never felt the urge to do so as i feel defying the inevitable is a progressionless and disappointing merrygoround of misery

if it is part of the human condition to give importance to that which surrounds us understandable it is so that we do not see the true picture of clarity

to unlock the greatest mysteries we must accept that we are nothing and all that we do know is relative to the size of the earth in the universes

nothing is more dangerous than contentment without progression

he is all to all and the philosophy is all to all

this world is all subjectivity

do nothing and there shall be nothing

all but divine is finite

intrigued i am by every dot on the big black canvas above us

of same kin we and all creations are

think beyond the time in which one stands

there is only one song i will ever write and it will be about the world i do not know

disappointment be not there when one thinks by the will of the divine

all that you say you are you aren’t

value your lows just as highly as your highs

fight not learn instead

the right way and the easiest are two entirely different paths

looking up at the worlds beyond our own will always be my favourite hobby

my uncurtained window letting through the morning sunlight was my alarm to begin my work

i am one with the soil the sea the sky and of course the cosmos

merely a vehicle am i for the creator’s creations in this world

i must do as i know and feel

with change we must accept

if not exhausted at the pillow are you then you are not doing all you can should and must

i wish not to die in the world in which i was born

there are only five texts that i carry on my person often the lexicon the constitution the prince the millettarian methodology and the omnidoxy

he and the giftgiver are the only ones i can truly trust

a child be one’s greatest test of all

whenever i begin to believe that that must be it of all my ideas the divine delivers me another

a day without the philosophy is a day without myself

be he will all things to all people yet it is my mission to show the world my him for if that is lost in the noise then the origins of all him are too lost

there shall be no narrowness in him or in the philosophy

the nature of money is that it comes and goes it is not a constant like you and i and for that reason we should not worry when an inconsistent entity does not exist as we wish it to for that is not integral to its nature

i wish for them he and i to be loved not feared

jealousy is the root of all evil

contentment is key to inner peace

if only one thing i have learnt is that to be the daydreamer is the greatest role of all

if you stay in the house long enough the world becomes a stranger

the dreams i have of him and them and the philosophy are more vivid to me than my family and friends

a gift from the divine is a gift to be cherished forever

why me i asked myself then i thought well why not

there’s something oh so terrifying about the end

for someone so young i think an awful lot about mortality

i will be remembered and live forever through him

astronism will be my eternal beacon

perhaps the greatest waste of time is getting to know someone

the hardest thing was to let them and the philosophy go from my complete control

my next task entails me officially binding myself to my writings and my mission i must find a suitable way in which to do so

my grand writings now need to be officially recognised and certified

we must explore for if we do not we are not fulfilling our purpose here

if not done by way of the vision then it not be done at all

my mission shielded me from one kind of trouble and threw me into another

death not only takes but gives it makes you realise what is important

there’s all that we are and all that we wish to be

when you build something of greatness it never comes in the order in which it ends

i surrender to my dream

do not fight that which you are

doubt is not within me it is all around me

choose not what they love but what you love

i need not any external to appease my internal

i will die when my job is done

when my mission can survive without me that is when the divine will come for me

my biggest fear is not getting done that which must be done before my short life ends

whatever you think someone feels is most likely the exact opposite
