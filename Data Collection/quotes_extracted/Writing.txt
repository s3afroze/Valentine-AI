when youre a writer the question people always ask you is where do you get your ideas writers hate this question its like asking humphrey bogart in the african queen where do you get your leeches you dont get ideas ideas get you

when you can write music that endures bravo until then keep quiet and study the work of those who can

writing poetry and reading books causes brain damage

personally i think socalled common language is more interesting and apropos than proper english its passionate and powerful in ways that wherefore art thou ass and thy elbow just isnt

imagination is what you do with your inspiration

an original writer is not one who imitates nobody but one whom nobody can imitate

asking a working writer what he thinks about critics is like asking a lamppost what it feels about dogs

the artist is a servant who is willing to be a birthgiver in a very real sense the artist male or female should be like mary who when the angel told her that she was to bear the messiah was obedient to the command

he thought that the rose was to be found in its own eternity and not in his words and that we may mention or allude to a thing but not express it

if you have a story that seems worth telling and you think you can tell it worthily then the thing for you to do is to tell it regardless of whether it has to do with sex sailors or mounted policemen

convince yourself that you are working in clay not marble on paper not eternal bronze let that first sentence be as stupid as it wishes

i am in awe of flowers

not because of their colors

i read anything that’s going to be interesting but you don’t know what it is until you’ve read it somewhere in a book on the history of false teeth there’ll be the making of a novel

into words particularly the bad things since happiness does not need to be transformed happiness is its own end

thy blemishes amend if so i could

but nought save homespun cloth i th house i find

in this array mongst vulgars mayst thou roam

and take thy way where yet thou art not known

i arrived i saw humans and i saw through their faces nothing ever changes but the light in their eyes for i too have buried my demons today without knowing what might remain beneath the face of tomorrow

you know you’re writing well when you’re throwing good stuff into the wastebasket

writers block is just a fancy way of saying i dont feel like doing any work today

let no one be fooled by the fact that we may write in english for we intend to do unheard of things with it

stories want to be told stories have a power of their own  you cant write a story until youve felt it breathed it in walked with your characters talked with them

reading feeds the soul writing nourishes it

i hereby grant you permission to write crap the more the better remember crap makes the best fertilizer

so you have to do it goddamnit

you can only write what you know if youve lived otherwise youll just be writing words

chasing after words like trying to grab the tails of comets

but what is more to the point is my belief that the habit of writing thus for my own eye only is good practice it loosens the ligaments never mind the misses and the stumbles

i dont write stories i write characters

all the friends in the world are in the fountain of a pen

it’s not easy to write a poem about a poem

don’t ever write a novel unless it hurts like a hot turd coming out

ive found the best way to revise your own work is to pretend that somebody else wrote it and then to rip the living shit out of it

but that inadequacy or feeling of inadequacy never really goes away you just have to trudge ahead in the rain regardless

i dont see how you can write anything of value if you dont offend someone

sometimes you have to go on when you dont feel like it and sometimes youre doing good work when if feels like all youre managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position

and enigmatic smile is worth ten pages of dialog

listen to your inner self it knows you best

she thought a writer should work harder writing a book than she did reading it

its the writing that teaches you

i write to believe in goodness

in words as fashions the same rule will hold

alike fantastic if too new or old

be not the first by whom the new are tried

nor yet the last to lay the old aside

but it isn’t a rough draft either the one i turned in several months ago was rough there were some bad plot holes some logical inconsistencies pacing problems and not nearly enough lesbian unicorns

houses under the sea

i love working with my hands my writing is rough my paper bruised with ink stains

organizations for writers palliate the writers loneliness but i doubt if they improve his writing for he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity or the lack of it each day

thats typically what writers do we just sit around complaining most of the time and the better things are going the more they complain

reading takes time and the glass teat takes too much of it

whenever theres something wrong with your writing suspect that theres something wrong with your thinking

the best way to show people true things is from a direction that they had not imagined the truth coming

i’ve learned to fall like the bjj player to protect the body through controlling the distribution of force by slapping the mat with hands open with hands open hands open open o pen

stories do not change only the lives they live in do

rejection isnt a sign of failure rejection is a reminder that theres always room for improvement

do you have an audience in mind when writing march  bookgeeks interview

being able to write becomes a kind of shield a way of hiding a way of too instantly transforming pain into honey

ours is a culture and a time immensely rich in trash as it is in treasures

since i had started to break down all my writing and get rid of all facility and try to make instead of describe writing had been wonderful to do

write down the thoughts of the moment those that come unsought for are commonly the most valuable

edit your manuscript until your fingers bleed and you have memorized every last word then when you are certain you are on the verge of insanityedit one more time

if you’re going to be a writer the first essential is just to write do not wait for an idea start writing something and the ideas will come you have to turn the faucet on before the water starts to flow

i think it can be tremendously refreshing if a creator of literature has something on his mind other than the history of literature so far literature should not disappear up its own asshole so to speak

be passionate about what you write believe in your ability to convey timeless ideas and let no one tell you what what youre capable of

humility is not a virtue in a writer it is an absolute necessity

the denial of language is a suicidal one and we pay for it with our own lives

the true life is not reducible to words spoken or written not by anyone ever

writing is both an act of power and surrender passion and discovery it is a tug at your soul that continues to pull you forward even as you go kicking and screaming p

a novel is like a dream in which everyone is you they’re all parts of yourself

a prose that is altogether alive demands something of the reader that the ordinary novel reader is not prepared to give

but i think cybil was my biggest fan she cut out my articles and hung them in her locker and we were always cracking up how if you wrote the simplest most obvious thing in the world people thought you were a genius

its a very excruciating life facing that blank piece of paper every day and having to reach up somewhere into the clouds and bring something down out of them

sometimes the things in our heads are far worse than anything they could put in books or on film

god how impossible life is without money nothing can ever overcome it its everything when its anything how can i write in peace with endless worries of money money money disappearing act

i write to reach eternity

i earn the magic of words by writing

i learn the myth of worlds by imagining

i dont write for a living i live to write

remember to have a little faith when you die i believe god isnt going to ask you what you published gods going to ask you what you wrote

i write in order to comprehend not to express myself

if i thought that what im doing when i write is expressing myself id junk the typewriter writing is a much more complicated activity that that

work freely and rollickingly as though you were talking to a friend who loves you mentally at least three or four times a day thumb your nose at all knowitalls jeerers critics doubters

if you want to write fiction the best thing you can do is take two aspirins lie down in a dark room and wait for the feeling to pass

the novel is perhaps the highest art form because it so closely resembles life it is about human relationships its technique page by page resembles our technique of living day by daya way of relating

what one wrote playfully another reads with tension and passion what one wrote with tension and passion another reads playfully

when im writing im waiting to see somebody and im waiting to hear them its almost like conjuring spirits out of the air using your own imaginative instability

in literature the ambition of the novice is to acquire the literary language the struggle of the adept is to get rid of it

any writer overwhelmingly honest about pleasing himself is almost sure to please others

a book unwritten is a delightful universe of infinite possibilities set down one word however and it immediately becomes earthbound set down one sentence and it’s halfway to being just like every other bloody book that’s ever been written

one writes to make a home for oneself on paper in time and in others minds

di color che sanno limit of the diaphane in why in diaphane adiaphane if you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate if not a door shut your eyes and see

the only impeccable writers are those who never wrote

it is no loss to mankind when one writer decides to call it a day when a

tree falls in the forest who cares but the monkeys

inside each of us are the children we were at each developmental stage

whats really needed is parenting of these inside children so that we bring them to ageappropriate activities

it doesnt matter how obscure or arcane or esoteric your place of publication may be some sweet law ensures that the person who should be scrutinizing your work eventually does do so

sometimes writing everyday is like pulling teeth painful but necessary

i write letters to my right brain all the time theyre just little notes and right brain who likes to get little notes from me will often come through within a day or two

and you are

she fluttered her hand over her face and

brushed a wisp of light brown hair from her brow

the governor calls me kitty it’d probably be best if you did too

what an alluring name it makes me think of a cat with its lips covered by a luscious coat of cream

jack stared at kitty’s mouth and his tongue tingled at the idea of tasting her rich flavorful lust

she giggled and wove her hand through the crook in his arm the soft swell of her breast bumped against his arm oh you’re naughty but i love the alluring image

then i hope you’ll let me have a taste later

he didn’t crowd her but allowed her to step back

she led him across the entranceway to a door on the other side

remember she’s a princess

rememberwe dont see objects we see light  light can do anything water can doflow wash trickle it can do anything an artist can dopaint burnish carve candlelight falls licks a face there is always light in a room

not writing was hard work almost as hard as writing

and george farr had the town the earth the world to himself and his sorrow music came faint as a troubling rumor beneath the spring night sweetened by distance a longing knowing no ease oh god oh god

how does the saying go when two locusts fight it is always the crow that feasts

is that a luo expression i asked sayids face broke into a bashful smile

if the writer were more like a reader he’d be a reader not a writer it’s as uncomplicated as that

all writing is filth

one can not understand language because language cannot understand itself does not want to understand

there is in writing the constant joy of sudden discovery of happy accident

the act of writing is the act of discovering what you believe

i almost always urge people to write in the first person writing is an act of ego and you might as well admit it

the writer must wade into life as into the sea but only up to the navel

a writer’s promise is like a tiger’s smile

what makes a story unique is not necessarily the information in the story but what the writer chooses to put in or leave outpg

for writing a first draft requires from the writer a peculiar internal state which ordinary life does not induce

how to set yourself spinning

i am too sick to be out of bed too crazy to sleep and am surrounded by horrors

there comes a point at which you stop writing and think all the more

caution not spirit let it roam wild for in that natural state dance embraces divine frequency

father has a strengthening character like the sun and mother has a soothing temper like the moon

do you know where your breakthrough begins your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends

there are some places you cant visit anymore

poetry and writings take you there

writing was a spiritual exercise for my father the only thing he really believed in

i only wrote prose before i met you

my musings were superfluous and serious as well

but now the words dance with me

i sing with them

and we create poetry

all of us possess a reading vocabulary as big as a lake but draw from a writing vocabulary as small as a pond the good news is that the acts of searching and gathering always expand the number of usable words

to write to try meticulously to retain something to cause something to survive to wrest a few precise scraps from the void as it grows to leave somewhere a furrow a trace a mark or a few signs

the twentieth century has built up a powerful set of intellectual shortcuts and devices that help us defend ourselves against moments when clouds suddenly appear to think

the politician

if it wasnt for graft youd get a very low type of people in politics men without ambition jellyfish

especially since you cant rob the people anyway

the politician

surehow was that

what you rob you spend and what you spend goes back to the people so wheres the robbery i read that in one of my fathers books

the politician

that book should be in every home

perhaps his tragedy is that he is the only normal writer left on earth  and it is this that adds to his isolation and so too his so sense of guilt

i left the bank

because they wouldn’t deposit

my cheque of poems

so i went to the store

but they didn’t accept

my currency of words

so i boxed all my stories

and took them to charity

but they refused my donation

and asked me to give blood instead

i opened the notebooks

and made them look what do you think

i wrote these in

as a writer i demand the right to write any character in the world that i want to write i demand the right to be them i demand the right to think them and i demand the right to tell the truth as i see they are

letter to alexander chekhov may

to make a deliberate falsification for personal gain is the last worst depth to which either scholar or artist can descend in work or life

letter to muriel st clare byrne  september

hold your pen and spare your voice

the one thing that you have that nobody else has is you your voice your mind your story your vision so write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can

keynote address university of the arts th commencement philadelphia pa may

writing is turning lifes worst moments into money

the stadium

have you ever entered an empty stadium try it stand in the middle of the field and listen there is nothing less empty than an empty stadium there is nothing less mute than stands bereft of spectators

i do not write poetry i take words and dip them in feelings

imagine in vibrant wonderful detail your heart’s desire—a reality only you can envision an adventure only you can direct

then cradle your creation caress it mold it coddle it until it comes to life

and when your precious treasure grows so grand as to steal your breath away set it free for all the world to experience for that is how you live your dreams

i write across several genres i’m a slut for words i can’t keep it in my literary pants

as quoted in the author biography on mankells official website

there have been times ive felt so much art in my soul i grew sick of artists

there is a ruthlessness to the creative act it often involves a betrayal of the status quo

i tell you this true story just to prove that i can that my frailty has not yet reached a point at which i can no longer tell a true story

writing vampire erotica is like writing sex scenes for porcupines

writers are insane for months we are lone wolves locked in our caves then overnight we become publicity hounds its a schizophrenic business

use all this life to make yourself a great writer thoughtful and kind slowly surely over the years

the one ironclad rule is that i have to try i have to walk into my writing room and pick up my pen every weekday morning

the more i know about god i am convinced he likes to read books and authors are his librarians every soul is a story waiting to be read

i started writing to make sense of the world that exists inside my heart

i’ve always said ‘i have nothing to say only to add’ and it’s with each addition that the writing gets done the first draft of anything is really just a track

all is aswarm with commentaries of authors there is a dearth

no matter what your age or your life path whether making art is your career or your hobby or your dream it is not too late or too egotistical or too selfish or too silly to work on your creativity

make no mistake those who write long books have nothing to say

of course those who write short books have even less to say

work dont think relax

i am when you stop to think of it a member of a fairly select group the final handful of american novelists who learned to read and write before they learned to eat a daily helping of video bullshit

language is the mother not the handmaiden of thought words will tell you things you never thought or felt before

the purpose of a writer is to keep civilisation from destroying itself

we do not wait for inspiration we work because weve jolly well got to but when all is said and done we toil at this particular job because its turned out to be our particular job and in a weird sort of way i suppose we may be said to like it

in order to be created a work of art must first make use of the dark forces of the soul

if you hear voices you’re a lunatic if you write down what they say you’re an author

goals are dreams with a deadline

a writer is very much like the captain on a star ship facing the unknown when you face the blank page and you have no idea where youre going it can be terrifying but it can also be the adventure of a lifetime

the music lets me see the story but the story doesnt let me write the words

my lips are fierce with passion my heart spins fiery beats a rhythm lives within my fingers and dances in my feet

an idea like a ghost must be spoken to a little before it will explain itself

a novel must show how the world truly is how characters genuinely think how events actually occur a novel should somehow reveal the true source of our actions

writing a novel is like going a great distance to take a small shit

a migraine is the cockblock of writing

the most essential gift for a good writer is a builtin shockproof shit detector this is the writers radar and all great writers have had it

base words are uttered only by the base

and can for such at once be understood

but noble platitudes — ah theres a case

where the most careful scrutiny is needed

to tell a voice thats genuinely good

from one thats base but merely has succeeded

if you have a dream keep it but write it down and take appropriate actions to see it manifest

im not trying to please anyone im just trying to write a damn book

first and foremost i am me im real i dont write to impress i write to express

depend upon it after all thomas literature is the most noble of professions in fact it is about the only one fit for a man for my own part there is no seducing me from the path

there were no absolutes in fiction no certain way to deliver what was needed so it was no surprise most technical writers considered novelwriting a gateway to madness

ten rules for writing fiction part two the guardian  february

i got this story from someone who had no business in the telling of it

i never waited for my irish cream coffee to be the right temperature with a storm happening outside and my fireplace crackling  i wrote every day at home in the office whether i felt like it or not i just did it

all stories are love stories

it takes writing a billion bad words before you get to the good ones

a writer doesnt dream of riches and fame though those things are nice a true writer longs to leave behind a piece of themselves something that withstands the test of time and is passed down for generations

the poet however uses these two crude primitive archaic forms of thought simile and metaphor in the most uninhibited way because his job is not to describe nature but to show you a world completely absorbed and possessed by the human mind

if you dont think too good dont think too much

fighting and writing’s deepest layers of beauty lie not only in the physical and mental realms of what we know but also as an incognizable instinct a realm we will never fully know but will forever feel

we all know writing is a reclusive lonely endeavour it just is but nobody writes alone

murphy is a writers best friend but you have to keep an eye on him or hell steal the silver

how can we manage to illuminate the pathos of our lives

as many authors have said if the writer is not surprised by events then chances are that the reader will not be either and grow bored

writing is talking to yourselfwith the hope of being overheard

its not how great the ideas are its about how you write them to make them great

like forearm veins my interests spread in different directions and eventually led to the hands to writing

trying to live up to yourself is the most trying thing

in the world of your story your outline is like the ten commandments unfortunately your characters are all atheists

when you write you are telling a storyto yourself when you revise you are telling a story to yourselfover and over again

whats so great about writing

you can make anything true

i love revisions…we can’t go back and revise our lives but being allowed to go back and revise what we have written comes closest

fiction is a great combination between experience and imagination

somebody is observing my writings i know that

thats one reason why i keep reading and writing

eating was still a sore point with smritishe failed to understandwhen interesting options like mango juice or chocolates were availablewhy was she forced by her stupid mother to eat boring regular meals

after much contemplationnikhil came up with a suggestiondont give her food till she herself asks for it

his ideastarveto knowtheworthof foodmade sense to abhilashathough it took her a great deal of resolve before she could actually try it out

so on a sundaythelady with an iron willtook over fromthe soft and kind hearted mothershe did not give her anything to eat and waited for the golden momentexpecting a hungry smriti to beg for food

but the much awaited moment never camesmriti was not at all bothered about her meal and kept playing happily the day turned into evening and still there was no trace of hunger in her

arent you feeling hungry now a worried mother had no option but to eat the humble pie and ask the daughter

no maa my friend pinky had brought wafers and chocolates those were so yummy that i ate them all

and that was the end of herstarveto knowtheworthoffoodmission

writing is beautiful like putting on a gold suit and going to sleep in it

im either going to be a writer or a bum

if the novel is dead im a necrophiliac

that’s the magic of revisions – every cut is necessary and every cut hurts but something new always grows

flowers dont tell they show thats the way good books should be toostephanie skeem author of flotsam

think of shakespeare and melville and you think of thunder lightning wind they all knew the joy of creating in large or small forms on unlimited or restricted canvases these are the children of the gods

as much as i like it when a book im writing speeds along the downside can be that an author becomes too eager to finish and rushes the end the end is even more important than the first page and rushing can damage it

its about getting up getting well and getting over getting happy okay getting happy

it is a lie to write in such way as to be rewarded by fame offered you by some snobbish quasiliterary groups in the intellectual gazettes

writing is done alone people do not talk about the things they do alone

in the country of the story the writer is king

for obviously the advantage for most writers is that no one sees them the writer is invisible which confers power

one hasnt become a writer until one has distilled writing into

a habit and that habit has been forced into an obsession

writing has to be an obsession it has to be something as organic

physiological and psychological as speaking or sleeping or eating

families are great murderers of the creative impulsive particularly husbands

i fix the cramped lined pages

with my curious stare how do you

come to exist

forget it never explain never apologize you can either write posthumously or you cant

if youre a writer write and always strive for excellence

i go silent so i can write when my tongue is wagging my fingers are silent

writing is like baking cupcakes youre trying to make something from the raw like with cupcakes its flour and eggs and stuff and with books its ideas and words the end result is the same though you want people to eat them up

what writing practice like zen practice does is bring you back to the natural state of mind…the mind is raw full of energy alive and hungry it does not think in the way we were brought up to thinkwellmannered congenial

to breathe is to live but to write unimpeded is to breathe eternal

history writing infect after a time a mans sense of himself

i go with the flow but i write against it

novels for me are how i find out whats going on in my own head and so thats a really useful and indeed critical thing to do when you do as many of these other things as i do

i edit my own stories to death they eventually run and hide from me

if i didnt have writing id be running down the street hurling grenades in peoples faces

i have always believed in the principle that immediate survival is more important than longterm survival

for me that emotional payoff is what it’s all about i want you to laugh or cry when you read a storyor do both at the same time i want your heart in other words if you want to learn something go to school

start writing by thinking not wrestling with words

the only happy author in this world is he who is below the care of reputation

im the first to admit that i dont write right now relax and enjoy the show the sideshow that is

a good many young writers make the mistake of enclosing a stamped selfaddressed envelope big enough for the manuscript to come back in this is too much of a temptation to the editor

the difference is slight to the influence of an author whether he is read by five hundred readers or by five hundred thousand if he can select the five hundred he reaches the five hundred thousand

one is seduced and battered in turn the result is presumably wisdom wisdom we are clinging to life like lizards

why is it so difficult to assemble those things that really matter in life and to dwell among them only i am referring to certain landscapes persons beasts books rooms meteorological conditions fruits in fact i insist on it

a letter is like a poem it leaps into life and shows very clearly the marks perhaps i should say thumbprints of an unwilling or unready composer

this is the weakness of most edifying or propaganda literature there is no diversityyou cannot in fact give god his due without giving the devil his due also

that isnt writing at all its typing

any given censor is a fool the very fact that he is a censor indicates that

theyll shore up my shit theyll radically revise it theyll pass it along

an old racetrack joke reminds you that your program contains all the winners names i stare at my typewriter keys with the same thought

i write because not breathing is not an option

beware of the compound adjective beloved of the tyro and the poetess

whenever i didnt know what to write next i put a swift river in front of his horse and sent the two of them across

i write because i hate a lot hard

a writer is not so much someone who has something to say as he is someone who has found a process that will bring about new things he would not have thought of if he had not started to say them

at last i understood that writing was this an impulse to share with other people a feeling or truth that i myself had

good prose should be transparent like a window pane

a writing cook and a cooking writer must be bold at the desk as well as the stove

write a lot and hit the streets a writer who doesnt keep up with whats out there aint gonna be out there

i think it is vanity to want to put into a story anything but the story itself

remember william blake who said improvement makes straight straight roads but the crooked roads without improvement are roads of genius

the truth is life itself is always startling strange unexpected but when the truth is told about it everybody knows at once that it is life itself and not made up

but in ordinary fiction movies etc everything is smoothed out to seem plausiblevillains made bad heroes splendid heroines glamorous and so on so that no one believes a word

it perhaps might be saidif any one daredthat the most worthless literature of the world has been that which has been written by the men of one nation concerning the men of another

first you have nothing and then astonishingly after ripping out your brain and your heart and betraying your friends and exlovers and dreaming like a zombie over the page till you cant see or hear or smell or taste you have something

i don’t want to write anything but takes

beginning to write you discover what you have to write about

just because were fictional characters doesnt mean you can pick us up and move us anywhere you wantthe people of lake woebegon

its as hard to get from almost finished to finished as to get from beginning to almost done

you cannot write unless you write much

most science fiction seemed to be written for people who already liked science fiction i wanted to write stories for anyone anywhere living at any time in the history of the world

any fool can write a book and most of them are doing it but it takes brains to build a house

we do not like the truth because it is simple we do not want the truth because it is hard and we do not trust the truth because it is free

a work in which there are theories is like an object which still has its pricetag on

if you are alone tell some stories to yourself this is a different kind of pleasure and it has indeed its reward i have tasted a little of everything and i have truly never enjoyed anything more

arithmetic is the death of story

remember that wasted minute at the start of the day hard luck but youll never find it again

rub the ashes and make ink of it

make the heart the pen

the intellect the writer

write that which has no end or limit

i really do literally put myself into a characters shoes

the moment of writing is not an escapeit is only an insistence through the imagination upon human ecstasy and a reminder that such ecstasy remains as much a birthright in this world as misery remains a condition of it

it’s not the word made flesh we want in writing in poetry and fiction but the flesh made word

nothing is more comical than seriousness understood as a virtue that has to precede all important literature

art is the writer not having control but the subject having control of the writer

what is the best way to write each of us has to discover her own way by writing writing teaches writing no one can tell you your own secret

the difference between a novelist and someone who tinkers around with writing is this novelists finish their books

remember the good hours when the words are flowing well and never mind the bad hours there is no life without them

thats one of the tragedies of this life  that the men who are most in need of a beating up are always enormous

in his earliest youth he had drawn inspiration from really bad authors as you may have seen from his style as he grew older he lost his taste for them but the excellent authors just didn’t fill him with the same enthusiasm

i grew up in a hospital and as a child i played in the dissecting room

what a strange thing to consider imagining a world into being with nothing but words intention and desire

i decided that if i was never going to sell anything as long as i lived i might as well do what i want to do cause then at least i wouldve done what i wanted to do in life whats that worth

if you cant impress them with your argument impress them with your actions

a key and a strangler  this is all a simple tale requires

it aint a crapshoot unless you write crap

the decision is your own voice an opinion is the echo of someone elses voice

how very clean

now as if in belated punishment for the invention of writing any message once posted on the internet was immortal words as numerous as the dust of the earth would linger forever in their millions and trillions and quadrillions and beyond

writing is a way of opening up to the world

i’m mesmerized by lipstick prints on coffee cups

see that your pores are open and your digestion is good that is i am confident the most important rule of all

keep a notebook travel with it eat with it sleep with it slap into it every stray thought that flutters up into your brain cheap paper is less perishable than gray matter and lead pencil markings endure longer than memory

the three great things are good health work and a philosophy of life i may add nay must add a fourth—sincerity without this the other three are without avail with it you may cleave to greatness and sit among the giants

getting into print the editor magazine march

sometimes god doesn’t send you into a battle to win it he sends you to end it

the process of writing has something infinite about it even though it is interrupted each night it is one single notation and it seems most true when it eschews artistic devices of any sort

seeing your own name on the book cover is like hearing your book saying hi thanks for writing me

find what gave you emotion what the action was that gave you excitement then write it down making it clear so that the reader can see it too prose is architecture not interior decoration and the baroque is over

no poem ever bought a hamburger or not too many

the hardest things to write are often the best things to read and the most deserving to be written

don’t start right off writing the ‘great american novel’ thats too much pressure and youll get disappointed start with porn it’s fun and a good way to get your feet wet

between the lines of every book the writer reveals their own secrets

no good writing flows from a polluted well  you can write about monsters but you cant be one

it is strange to hear my words

read back to me

i dont think i wrote them

to have them ever leave the page

i think i only write

what happens across my brain

when my feet are too weary

to dance anymore

i have an object a task let me say the word a passion the profession of writing is a violent and almost indestructible one

letter to jules boucoiran  march

when the ink runs dry youre most likely writing at the wrong angle

the crazy thing about poetry is how its simplicity makes it complicated

on charles dickens it has been the peculiarity and the marvel of this man’s power that he has invested his puppets with a charm that has enabled him to dispense with human nature

writing is the new reading

writer’s block results from too much head cut off your head pegasus poetry was born of medusa when her head was cut off you have to be reckless when writing be as crazy as your conscience allows

creative work is often driven by pain it may be that if you dont have something in the back of your head driving you nuts you may not do anything its not a good arrangement if i were god i wouldnt have done it that way

interview the wall street journal nov

the one duty we owe to history is to rewrite it

behind the perfection of a mans style must lie the passion of a mans soul

do not start me on the da vinci code  a novel so bad that it gives bad novels a bad name

discussion at woodruff auditorium in lawrence ks october

writing starts with living

the one thing which seems to me quite impossible is to take into consideration the kind of book one is expected to write surely one can only write the book that is there to be written

letter to muriel st clare byrne  september

and life is a good thing for a writer its where we get our raw material for a start we quite like to stop and watch it

interview the paris review issue  winter

and so i just kept writing to myself

get to work your work is to keep cranking the flywheel that turns the gears that spin the belt in the engine of belief that keeps you and your desk in midair

persistence can look a lot like stupid

the more we are willing to separate from distraction and step into the open arms of boredom the more writing will get on the page

most writing is done between the mind and the hand not between the hand and the page

the job of a writer is not to convey emotion but to invoke it

all writing is discipline but screenwriting is a drill sergeant

everyone should read we say but we act as if only those with special talent should write

everything ive written up to this point is crap now im going to write the real one

polysyllables obfuscate a preponderant ignorance with so much more style and panache

i want to do something splendid… something heroic or wonderful that won’t be forgotten after i’m dead… i think i shall write books

i always say to people who want to write live life dont stand on the rim dont sit on the sidelines make mistakes make a mess get it wrong read everything and get out and be in life

ah i do so love this charmingly rustic elvin kingdombaozhai

it is not my words that i polish but my ideas

writing is more than a gift it is a struggle that blesses those who see it through to the end

alone alone to the very end i… every one of us but to have been granted the grace of meeting and touching so fleetingly is that not the most awesome and wonderful thing one can hope for in this world

im sorry billy says but i felt it was too organized i like ellipses and teeny jottings and spontaneous poems and particularly all those devices like long lists of melancholy things

a good writer refuses to be socialized he insists on his own version of things his own consciousness and by doing so he draws the readers eye from its usual groove into a new way of seeing things

for me the thing that signals a great story is what we might call its autonomy the fact that it detaches itself from its author like a soap bubble blown from a clay pipe

for your writing to come aliveto be multidimensionalyou must barter away some control

the writer’s obsession – the desire to know and communicate or rather to know everything so as to communicate with the greatest degree of precision

i always had plenty of ideas i didn’t exactly have them they grew—little by little a half an idea at a time first part of a phrase and then a person to go with it after a person then a little corner of a place for the person to be in

the throes of poetry  hymns formed from groans of acquaintance its rhythm weaving between tranquility compassions and peril  like bare feet stomping on broken glass  bleeds recoils then steps again

i love this quote from frances mayes it pretty much sums up the great unknown of book writing

she had a habit of walking around in white cotton panties and writing poetry on the back of crumpled envelopes

if i can write who possibly can’t even drawing a line in the sand is writing

if one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child then one million of you are a million times guilty

good fiction writers have an instinctive understanding of human nature thats what makes stories and characters captivating good spiritual writers share what they sincerely practice themselves

no crime is a means to an end no crime can be rationalized

if one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty

silence is a cage these words are my wings

i want to read every book that’s written

and hold the zing of each fruit on my tongue

words and magic are two powerful forces that can change the world

i learned from the age of two or three that any room in our house at any time of day was there to read in or be read to

what ive learned about writing is that sometimes less is more while often more is grander and both are true

a good approach is to allow one dream per novel then in the final revision go back and get rid of that too

as quoted on writersservices  march

and speaking of this wonderful machine

i’m puzzled by the difference between

two methods of composing a the kind which goes on solely in the poet’s mind

a testing of performing words while he

is soaping a third time one leg and b

the other kind much more decorous when

he’s in his study writing with a pen in method b the hand supports the thought

the abstract battle is concretely fought

the pen stops in midair then swoops to bar

a canceled sunset or restore a star

and thus it physically guides the phrase

toward faint daylight through the inky maze

but method a is agony the brain

is soon enclosed in a steel cap of pain

a muse in overalls directs the drill which grinds and which no effort of the will

is taking off what he has just put on or walking briskly to the corner store  to buy the paper he has read before

how many things can i do without

writing things was important wasnt it nakata asked

yes it was the process of writing was important even though the finished product is completely meaningless

remember this write what you dont know new york times book review december

if we were to understand how important it is to say something and say it well maybe we wouldn’t write a single word but that would be tragic

writing is a gift to both the writer and the reader

to me its all art inside the studio and out at least it is if we approach our lives that way

i do not wish to comment on the work if it does not speak for itself it is a failure

let all your life’s experiences lead to more writing  encourage more reading

the other day when i was deciding where to place a mountain range how to make a rivers flow detour around underground stalactite caves and what precise color to give the sky at sunset i realized i was god or an artist and a writer

poetry is the unheard cry of a flower wilting  it is a humble lucent tear shed with meaning  it is the lovely portrayal of ugliness and the bitter edge of sweet

you think

i do

it takes a while you see the tall girl you go to more doctors you celebrate arlennys phd defense and then one june night you scribble the exs name and the halflife of love is forever

you bust out a couple more things then you put your head down the next day you look at the new pages for once you dont want to burn them or give up writing forever its a start you say to the room

thats about it in the months that follow you bend to the work because it feels like hope like grace—and because you know in your lying cheaters heart that sometimes a start is all we ever get

a lack of narrative structure as you know will cause anxiety

the fiction defense sometimes i just need to use it
