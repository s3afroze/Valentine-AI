before you examine the body of a patient

be patient to learn his story

for once you learn his story

you will also come to know

his body

before you diagnose any sickness

make sure there is no sickness in the mind or heart

for the emotions in a man’s moon or sun

can point to the sickness in

any one of his other parts

before you treat a man with a condition

know that not all cures can heal all people

for the chemistry that works on one patient

may not work for the next

because even medicine has its own

before asserting a prognosis on any patient

always be objective and never subjective

for telling a man that he will win the treasure of life

but then later discovering that he will lose

will harm him more than by telling him

that he may lose

but then he wins

sed nescio quo modo nihil tam absurde dici potest quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosphorum there is nothing so absurd but some philosopher has said it

forgiveness is created by the restitution of the abuser of the wrongdoer it is not something to be squeeeeeezed out of the victim in a further act of consciencecorrupting abuse

the philosopher whose dealings are with divine order himself acquires the characteristics of order and divinity

black and white

i was born into

but with so many other

religions and

how do i know which

is it not

my birthright

to seek out the light

to find truth

after surveying all the proof

am i supposed

to love

or fight

and why do all those who

try to guide me

always start by dividing

and multiplying me –

from what they consider

wrong or right

there were no walls

for whoever beams truth and light

and how can one speak on lights behalf

lf all they do

but talk white

yesterday i was sad tomorrow i may be sad again but today i know that i am happy i want to live on and on delighting like a pagan in all that is physical and i know that this one lifetime however long cannot satisfy my heart

a spider and a fly

i heard a spider

and a fly arguing

wait said the fly

do not eat me

i serve a great purpose

in the world

you will have to

show me said the spider

gutters and sewers

and garbage cans

said the fly and gather

up the germs of

and pneumonia on my feet

and wings

then i carry these germs

and give them diseases

all the people who

have lived the right

from the diseases

and the old soaks who

have weakened their systems

with liquor and iniquity

succumb it is my mission

to help rid the world

of these wicked persons

i am a vessel of righteousness

and serving the noblest uses

it is true said the spider

that you are more

than i am but i do not

serve the utilitarian deities

i serve the gods of beauty

look at the gossamer webs

i weave they float in the sun

if you get what i mean

i do not work at anything

i play all the time

i am busy with the stuff

of enchantment and the materials

of fairyland my works

i am the artist

a creator and demi god

it is ridiculous to suppose

that i should be denied

the food i need in order

to continue to create

beauty i tell you

plainly mister fly it is all

damned nonsense for that food

to rear up on its hind legs

and say it should not be eaten

you have convinced me

said the fly say no more

and shutting all his eyes

he prepared himself for dinner

and yet he said i could

have made out a case

for myself too if i had

had a better line of talk

of course you could said the spider

clutching a sirloin from him

but the end would have been

just the same if neither of

us had spoken at all

boss i am afraid that what

the spider said is true

and it gives me to think

furiously upon the futility

the shadowmaker shapes forever

it is when those who are not strong enough have made some moderate amount of progress that they fail and give up

someone said to me once that a cigarette at the right moment is better than all the ideals in the world

lifes managed not cured

reality is harsh it can be cruel and ugly yet no matter how much we grieve over our environment and circumstances nothing will change what is important is not to be defeated to forge ahead bravely if we do this a path will open before us

true happiness we are told consists in getting out of ones self but the point is not only to get out  you must stay out and to stay out you must have some absorbing errand

we live in deeds not years in thoughts not breaths in feelings not figures on a dial we should count time by heart throbs he most lives who thinks most feels noblest acts the best

to live is to change to acquire the words of a story and that is the only celebration we mortals really know

the problem with religion because its been sheltered from criticism is that it allows people to believe en masse what only idiots or lunatics could believe in isolation

if a man who can’t count finds a four leaf clover is he lucky

down with hell and heaven and all the religious fuss

infinity pleased our parents

when faith in our freedom gives way to fear of our freedom silencing the minority view becomes the operative protocol

where we choose to be where we choose to bewe have the power to determine that in our lives we cannot reel time backward or forward but we can take ourselves to the place that defines our being

deliverance is not for me in renunciation i feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight

this time there was no escape i could not turn away could not leave without accepting what i had done there was only one way to the other side and that was through the pain

my teacher asked my favorite color  i said ‘rainbow’ and i was punished to stand out of my class

wild animals are less wild and more human than many humans of this world

creativity sparks originality which then manifests itself into what we call evolution to depreciate imagination is to depreciate life

we never realize just how many other lives we can help when their paths cross our own

when people have invested their identities into clichés the only counter argument they have is being offended

philosophy is the toil which can never tire persons engaged in it all ways are strewn with roses and the farther you go the more enchanting objects appear before you and invite you on

you were free you are free and you will be free

who we are now is all that really matters

i cannot encourage any fabrication even for the sake of making people feel good if i were to fabricate consciously and knowingly i would not only be ordaining myself their enemy but also ordaining myself gods enemy

electricity was a reality in the universe when moses led the children of israel out of the land of egypt this is true of all natural laws they have always existed but only when understood may they be used

for this feeling of wonder shows that you are a philosopher since wonder is the only beginning of philosophy

give the pupils something to do not something to learn and the doing is of such a nature as to demand thinking learning naturally results

few things are more deceptive than memories

crazy horse dreamed and went into the world where there is nothing but the spirits of all things that is the real world that is behind this one and everything we see here is something like a shadow from that one

knowledge is really confined to experience the laws of nature are as kant said the laws of our minds and as huxley said the generalization of observed facts

this is not the special pleading of a professed magician it boils down to the advice not to judge subjects of which you are perfectly ignorant and is to be found stated in clearer and lovelier language in the essays of thomas henry huxley

i have learnt through bitter experience the one supreme lesson to conserve my anger and as heat conserved is transmuted into energy even so our anger controlled can be transmuted into a power which can move the world

there is nothing deep down inside us except what we have put there ourselves

from a certain point onward there is no longer any turning back

i dont think the real america is in new york or on the pacific coast personally i like the middle west much better places like north and south dakota minneapolis and saint paul there i think are the true americans

we are often taught to look for the beauty in all things so in finding it the layman asks the philosopher while the philosopher asks the photographer

it is our attitude toward events not events themselves which we can control nothing is by its own nature calamitous  even death is terrible only if we fear it

we are alone live our lives lacking anything better to do devise reason later

i hold strongly to this that it is better to be impetuous than circumspect because fortune is a woman and if she is to be submissive it is necessary to beat and coerce her

every form of happiness if one every desire is driven by the same motorby our love for a single value for the highest potentiality of our own existenceand every achievement is an expression of it

i while the gods laugh the worlds vortex am

maelström of passions in that hidden sea

whose waves of alltime lap the coasts of me

and in small compass the dark waters cram

i while the gods laugh the worlds vortex am

nobody understands the nature of the church or the ringing note of the creed descending from antiquity who does not realize that the whole world once very nearly died of broadmindedness and the brotherhood of all religions

first anyone who seriously intends to become a philosopher

must once in his life withdraw into himself and attempt

within himself to overthrow and build anew all the sciences

that up to then he has been accepting philosophy wisdom

sagesse is the philosophizers quite personal affair it must

arise as his wisdom as his selfacquired knowledge tending

toward universality a knowledge for which he can answer from

the beginning and at each step by virtue of his own absolute

happiness will grow if you plant the seeds of love in the garden of hope with compassion and care

you may lie with your mouth but with the mouth you make as you do so you none the less tell the truth

you cannot connect with anyone except through reality

there’s been terrible things we seen en’t there and more a coming more’n likely so i think i’d rather not know what’s in the future i’ll stick to the present

to be or not to be what a question

if youve got the truth you can demonstrate it talking doesnt prove it

thinking only begins at the point where we have come to know that reason glorified for centuries is the most obstinate adversary of thinking

it is hard to be angry when one has seen the sun rise she said

it seems to be true he admitted i wonder why

because it makes one feel so small and insignificant it has been rising forever and will rise forever no matter what we do or do not do all our problems are as nothing to the sun

true philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness i am life that wants to live in the midst of life that wants to live

it is easy to be conspicuously compassionate if others are being forced to pay the cost

the stone that was rolled before christs tomb might appropriately be called the philosophers stone because its removal gave not only the pharisees but now for  years the philosophers so much to think about

because each of you has his or her own death you carry it with you in a secret place from the moment youre born it belongs to you and you belong to it

i think that the task of philosophy is not to provide answers but to show how the way we perceive a problem can be itself part of a problem

the best things in life are crazy

the mark of your ignorance is the depth of your belief in injustice and tragedy what the caterpillar calls the end of the world the master calls a butterfly

a life fueled by passions is like riding on the back of a dragon

im more than ever of the opinion that a decent human existence is possible today only on the fringes of society where one then runs the risk of starving or being stoned to death in these circumstances a sense of humor is a great help

we get swallowed up by the illusion that unless we can find a place to belong we are going to be all alone in the world

i have two enemies in all the world

the hunger of the hungry and the fullness of the full

in any compromise between food and poison it is only death that can win in any compromise between good and evil it is only evil that can profit

the root of humanly caused evil is not mans animal nature not territorial aggression or innate selfishness but our need to gain selfesteem deny our mortality and achieve a heroic selfimage our desire for the best is the cause of the worst

which came first the mind or the idea of the mind have you never wondered they arrived together the mind is an idea

in some remote corner of the universe poured out and glittering among innumerable solar systems there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge

intelligence is more important than strength that is why earth is ruled by men and not by animals

unless we learn to know ourselves we run the danger of destroying ourselves

thats the mantra of the world

truth gains more even by the errors of one who with due study and preparation thinks for himself than by the true opinions of those who only hold them because they do not suffer themselves to think…

for it can never be that war shall preserve life and peace destroy it

when you are angry try your best to go to sleep it keeps you away from speaking writing and thinking while you are angry

an inventor is a man who asks why of the universe and lets nothing stand between the answer and his mind

this heart within me i can feel and i judge that it exists this world i can touch and i likewise judge that it exists there ends all my knowledge and the rest is construction  forever i shall be a stranger to myself

and this is the forbidden truth the unspeakable taboo  that evil is not always repellent but frequently attractive that it has the power to make of us not simply victims as nature and accident do but active accomplices

one has to take a somewhat bold and dangerous line with this existence especially as whatever happens we are bound to lose it

dont think but look pi

consider the following sequence of cases which we shall call the tale of the slave and imagine it is about you

there is a slave completely at the mercy of his brutal master’s whims he is often cruelly beaten called out in the middle of the night and so on

the master is kindlier and beats the slave only for stated infractions of his rules not fulling the work quota and so on he gives the slave some free time

the master has a group of slave and he decides how things are to be allocated among them on nice grounds taking into account their needs merit and so on

the master allows the slave four days on their own and requires them to work only three days a week on his land the rest of the time is their own

existence is beyond the power of words

but are none of them absolute

philosophy from the earliest times has made greater claims and achieved fewer results than any other branch of learning

before this moment i have never whished to be something other than what i am

i think in life we sometimes subconsciously choose what we cant live without to find that we can live without it is just something we tell ourselves because we don’t want to choose or to make a decision on what we say we can’t live without

wolves dont perform in a circus and people with a mind of their own dont perform in a circus either

a mans work is nothing but his slow trek to rediscover through the detours of art those two or three great and simple images in whose presence his heart first opened

i am wishing you and the loved ones prosperity more opportunities good health good relationship good partner good job and more years more money more blessings more fun more peace and happiness

may the lord grant you the desire of your heart  may all your hard work pay off and all your dreams come through

words sing and dance too

love is a mode of knowledge and when the love is sufficiently disinterested and sufficiently intense the knowledge becomes unitive knowledge and so takes on the quality of infallibility

charity  unlike the lower forms of love  is not an emotion it begins as an act of the will and is consummated as a purely spiritual awareness a unitive loveknowledge of the essence of its object

new years are so full of old years promises

the new year bell rings

promises to be

for the coming year

weve all had our christmas

but what of our future

as it draws so near

i promise not to laugh

at your ridiculous gear

or to say how much youve put on

in the passing of a year

i promise not to cry

when i leave you by the side

the side of the roadway

as i say goodbye

so  has come at last

and just as our friendship

it will come to pass

the bell keeps on chiming

incessant as it sounds

i will be forever thankful

dont try to think or speak for other people that way is madness

truth is absolut if the definition is identical

truth is absolute if the definition is identical

im a lone wolf

in the world of

stretched across the universe is an imagination of stars

sometimes you have to separate the colors to see the teardrops

perspective changes when you have money and wealth

if you think you’re always right you’re usually always wrong

that statues are motionless would be true only if the earth were the universe

all life forms could have originated from one source

the cost of our goals is the life we exchange in pursuit of them and because the outcome of your attempts can never be guaranteed you owe it to yourself to enjoy the pursuit itself

you don’t actually want the things or experiences themselves you want the good feelings associated with the things or experiences

and thats what life is all about

celebrate friday by celebrating life

life isnt about wedding and having children

it is an adventurous opportunity to do

what other living creatures cant

balls were meant to be hit

the sleep of reason breeds monsters

good things happen bad things are done

imagination brings everything to life

my philosophy with health techniques is to try them out on plants first and if the plants thrive i then try them out

it is possibly pure coincidence that every movement today that threatens the powerful is taken over by those that seek to suppress individuals and control the messages which are heard

you must find your own light just like the light does

learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think

it means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to chose how you construct meaning from experience

around you

as your shawl

my words

will warm

your

body and

words dont leave

words are kind

and oving

and caring too

happy when we

may be sad

words are philosophical

they make us go deep

to understand life

and things that happen

words are our identify

words are for eternity

who we think we are

and who we become

while it was once possible to simply identify people in relation to a more powerful figure as assistant wife staff servant serf slave or other the internet provided the opportunity for all to have an equal voice free of relation to others

if you cannot tolerate do not contribute

all colors go together

we dont need to be number one

we just need to be one

love keeps on shining no matter what time of the day or night

goals are meant for today

dreams are meant for tomorrow
