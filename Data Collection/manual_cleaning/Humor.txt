i was ninety percent sure

i see clary said there must have been something in her voice because he turned to look at her her hand cracked across his face a slap that rocked him back on his heels he put his hands on his cheek more in surprise than pain

what the hell was that for

the other ten percent

there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor

blown up a toilet weve never blown up a toilet

out of the corner of her eye she thought she saw jace shoot her a look of white rage  but when she glanced at him he looked as he always did easy confident slightly bored

in future clarissa he said it might be wise to mention that you already have a man in your bed to avoid such tedious situations

you invited him into bed simon demanded looking shaken

ridiculous isnt it said jace we would never have all fit

i didnt invite him into bed clary snapped we were just kissing

just kissing jaces tone mocked her with its false hurt how swiftly you dismiss our love

history will be kind to me for i intend to write it

so be sure when you step step with care and great tact and remember that lifes a great balancing act and will you succeed yes you will indeed  and ¾ percent guaranteed kid youll move mountains

isabelle looked mildly alarmed not permanently

no said jace just for a few hours unless i dont come back he added thoughtfully in which case maybe he does get to keep alec think of it as a lease with an option to buy

isabelle looked dubious mom and dad wont be pleased if they find out

that you freed a possible criminal by trading away your brother to a warlock who looks like a gay sonic the hedgehog and dresses like the child catcher from chitty chitty bang bang simon inquired no probably not

im not going to wear a red dress she said

it would look stunning my lady she called

she spoke to the bubbles gathered on the surface of the water if theres anyone i wish to stun at dinner ill hit him in the face

of all the trees we couldve hit we had to get one that hits back

it was probably important to her

if you ever find yourself in the wrong story leave

the capacity for friendship is gods way of apologizing for our families

i doubt hed fit

every now and then i like to do as im told just to confuse people

he accepted that statement with a nod

i want to do a lot of things to your body but thats not one of them

none too convincingly and youre not as pretty to look at as tessa is jem said closing his eyes as he leaned back against the pillow

how rude many who have gazed upon me have compared the experience to gazing at the radiance of the sun

jem still had his eyes closed if they mean it gives you a headache they arent wrong

wisdom comes from experience experience is often a result of lack of wisdom

beautiful face beautiful body horrible attitude it was the holy trinity of hot boys

whats the good of living if you dont try a few things

from there to here from here to there funny things are everywhere

because you cant argue with all the fools in the world its easier to let them have their way then trick them when theyre not paying attention

its not gray clary felt compelled to point out its green

i thought id lie on the floor and writhe in pain for a while he grunted it relaxes me

well theres so little opportunity for fun left in my life i agree we position ourselves on either side of peeta lean over until our faces are inches frim his nose and give him a shake peeta peeta wake up i say in a soft singsong voice

his eyelids flutter open and then he jumps like weve stabbed him aa

finnick and i fall back in the sand laughing our heads off every time we try to stop we look at peetas attempt to maintain a disdainful expression and it sets us off again

love can change a person the way a parent can change a baby awkwardly and often with a great deal of mess

animals are my friendsand i dont eat my friends

never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups

the longer and more carefully we look at a funny story the sadder it becomes

i have the simplest tastes i am always satisfied with the best

dont think of it as dying said death just think of it as leaving early to avoid the rush

forgive o lord my little jokes on thee

and ill forgive thy great big one on me

ginny said mr weasley flabbergasted havent i taught you anything what have i always told you never trust anything that can think for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brain

jace shook his blond head in exasperation

you had to make a crazy jail friend didnt you you couldnt just count ceiling tiles or tame a pet mouse like normal prisoners do

a smile is a curve that sets everything straight

my rapier wit hides my inner pain

headline he asked

desperately lonely swing set needs loving home he said

black holes are where god divided by zero

i always arrive late at the office but i make up for it by leaving early

magnificent repeated jace who was just being nasty magnus growled the growl sounded like get out

when god created mothers

when the good lord was creating mothers he was into his sixth day of overtime when the angel appeared and said youre doing a lot of fiddling around on this one

the angel shook her head slowly and said six pairs of hands no way

its not the hands that are causing me problems god remarked its the three pairs of eyes that mothers have to have

thats on the standard model asked the angel god nodded

god said the angel touching his sleeve gently get some rest tomorrow

i cant said god im so close to creating something so close to myself already i have one who heals herself when she is sickcan feed a family of six on one pound of hamburgerand can get a nine year old to stand under a shower

the angel circled the model of a mother very slowly its too soft she sighed

but tough said god excitedly you can imagine what this mother can do or endure

can it think

not only can it think but it can reason and compromise said the creator

finally the angel bent over and ran her finger across the cheek

theres a leak she pronounced i told you that you were trying to put too much into this model

its not a leak said the lord its a tear

whats it for

its for joy sadness disappointment pain loneliness and pride

you are a genius  said the angel

somberly god said i didnt put it there

trains are great dirty smoky things said will you wont like it

tessa was unmoved i wont know if i like it until i try it will i

ive never swum naked in the thames before but i know i wouldnt like it

but think how entertaining for sightseers said tessa and she saw jem duck his head to hide the quick flash of his grin

alec looked at her and shook his head how do you manage never to get mud on your clothes

isabelle shrugged philosophically im pure at heart it repels the dirt

no sight so sad as that of a naughty child he began especially a naughty little girl do you know where the wicked go after death

they go to hell was my ready and orthodox answer

and what is hell can you tell me that

and should you like to fall into that pit and to be burning there for ever

no sir

what must you do to avoid it

i deliberated a moment my answer when it did come was objectionable i must keep in good health and not die

im killing time while i wait for life to shower me with meaning and happiness

you can only be young once but you can always be immature

maybe our girlfriends are our soulmates and guys are just people to have fun with

its hard to enjoy practical jokes when your whole life feels like one

you deal with mythological stuff for a few years you learn that paradises are usually places where you get killed

i looked at grover who was trying hard not to laugh

jeez nico i said ive never really tried

whats up i asked

you tell me he said you were the one about ready to start making out with adrian

it was an experiment i said it was part of my therapy

what the hell kind of therapy are you in

nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love

good sex is like good bridge if you dont have a good partner youd better have a good hand

nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news which obeys its own special laws

if you are a student you should always get a good nights sleep unless you have come to the good part of your book and then you should stay up all night and let your schoolwork fall by the wayside a phrase which means flunk

life doesnt imitate art it imitates bad television

we need to talk all of us about what were going to do now

i was going to watch project runway

but maia still looking at alec and magnus broke off and rasied her eyebrows simon turned to see what she was looking at  and stared

maia looked perplexed wait a second she said do we all have to do that too

five exclamation marks the sure sign of an insane mind

sebastian just smiled i could hear your heart beating he said softly when you were watching me with valentine did it bother you

that you seem to be dating my dad jace shrugged you’re a little young for him to be honest

what for the first time since jace had met him sebastian seemed flabbergasted

the easy confidence with which i know another mans religion is folly teaches me to suspect that my own is also

i figured something out the future is unpredictable

see the problem is that god gives men a brain and a penis and only enough blood to run one at a time

if you love something set it free but dont be surprised if it comes back with herpes

hermes ignored them one night when this boys mother wasnt watching he sneaked out of their cave and stole some cattle that belonged to apollo

did he get blasted to tiny pieces i asked

hmm  no actually everything turned out quite well to make up for his theft the boy gave apollo an instrument hed inventeda lyre apollo was so enchanted with the music that he forgot all about being angry

i dont think my mom would like that moral

and when he created suicide he was low

when he created you lying in bed

he knew what he was doing

he was drunk and he was high

and he created the mountains and the sea and fire at the same time

he made some mistakes

but when he created you lying in bed

he came all over his blessed universe

when i buy a new book i always read the last page first that way in case i die before i finish i know how it ends that my friend is a dark side

sometimes when it looks like im deep in thought im just trying not to have a conversation with people

what was that belgarath asked coming back around the corner

brill silk replied blandly pulling his murgo robe back on

trying to fly last time i saw him silk smirked

he wasnt doing it very well silk added

belgarath shrugged maybe itll come to him in time

he doesnt really have all that much time silk glanced out over the edge

i could kiss you chubs cried

please dont i gasp out feeling his arms tighten around my ribs to the point of cracking them

molesting the vampire while hes too weak to fight back iz jace asked im pretty sure that violates at least one of the accords

in the long second before everyone absorbs what just happened i see the angel rolling his eyes heavenward like a teenager in the presence of overwhelming lameness some people just have no sense of gratitude

if after reading this book you come to my home and brutally murder me i do not blame you

one of the things ford prefect had always found hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very very obvious

my opinions may have changed but not the fact that im right

im not dumb i just have a command of thoroughly useless information

im not absolutely certain of the facts but i rather fancy its shakespeare who says that its always just when a fellow is feeling particularly braced with things in general that fate sneaks up behind him with the bit of lead piping

did he just rip out the engine i asked

yes saiman said and now he is demolishing the maserati with it

the first melodic notes of an old song came from the computer i glanced at saiman

he shrugged it begged for a soundtrack

what massie asked why

breeze strolled over to the table and chose a seat with his characteristic decorum the portly man raised his dueling cane pointing it at ham i see that my period of intellectual respite has come to an end

common sense is the most widely shared commodity in the world for every man is convinced that he is well supplied with it

odd said arthur i thought you said it was a democracy

i did said ford it is

so said arthur hoping he wasnt sounding ridiculously obtuse why dont people get rid of the lizards

you mean they actually vote for the lizards

oh yes said ford with a shrug of course

but said arthur going for the big one again why

because if they didnt vote for a lizard said ford the wrong lizard might get in got any gin
