there is no pretending jace said with absolute clarity i love you and i will love you until i die and if there is life after that ill love you then

hes like a drug for you bella

when someone loves you the way they talk about you is different you feel safe and comfortable

you cant force love i realized its there or it isnt if its not there youve got to be able to admit it if it is there youve got to do whatever it takes to protect the ones you love

some women choose to follow men and some women choose to follow their dreams if youre wondering which way to go remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesnt love you anymore

the best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds and thats what youve given me thats what id hoped to give you forever

and im suppose to sit by while you date boys and fall in love with someone else get married his voice tightened and meanwhile ill die a little bit more every day watching

they didn’t agree on much in fact they didn’t agree on anything they fought all the time and challenged each other ever day but despite their differences they had one important thing in common they were crazy about each other

the very essence of romance is uncertainty

if music be the food of love play on

give me excess of it that surfeiting

the appetite may sicken and so die

if you love somebody let them go for if they return they were always yours if they dont they never were

i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun

i can feel peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks so now that youve got me what are you going to do with me i turn into him put you somewhere you cant get hurt

when love is not madness it is not love

only a true best friend can protect you from your immortal enemies

true love is rare and its the only thing that gives life real meaning

i was smiling yesterdayi am smiling today and i will smile tomorrowsimply because life is too short to cry for anything

is this the moment harry asked weakly and when nothing happened except that ron and hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot he raised his voice oi theres a war going on here

ron and hermione broke apart their arms still around each other

i know mate said ron who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a bludger so its now or never isnt it

never mind that what about the horcrux harry shouted dyou think you could just  just hold it in until weve got the diadem

yeah  right  sorry  said ron and he and hermione set about gathering up fangs both pink in the face

never close your lips to those whom you have already opened your heart

it isnt possible to love and part you will wish that it was you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal

say provoking again your mouth looks provocative when you do

you here to finish me off sweetheart

every great love starts with a great story

you know what charm is a way of getting the answer yes without having asked any clear question

i must go uncertain of my fate but i shall return hither or follow your party as soon as possible a word a look will be enough to decide whether i enter your fathers house this evening or never

i stood still vision blurring and in that moment i heard my heart break it was a small clean sound like the snapping of a flowers stem

and he took her in his arms and kissed her under the sunlit sky and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls in the sight of many

i knew in the silence that followed that anything could happen here it might be too late again i might have missed my chance but i would at least know i tried that i took my heart and extended my hand whatever the outcome

okay he said he took a breath what would you do if you could do anything

i took a step toward him closing the space between us this i said and then i kissed him

im not sentimentalim as romantic as you are the idea you know

is that the sentimental person thinks things will lastthe romantic

person has a desperate confidence that they wont

you could have fooled me everytime i called you luke said you were sick i figured you were avoiding me again

i wasnt i did want to talk to you ive been thinking about you all the time

ive been thinking about you too

i really was sick i swear i almost died back there on the ship you know

i know everytime you almost die i almost die myself

my soul will find yours

peeta how come i never know when youre having a nightmare i say

i dont know i dont think i cry out or thrash around or anything i just come to paralyzed with terror he says

you should wake me i say thinking about how i can interrupt his sleep two or three times on a bad night about how long it can take to calm me down

its not necessary my nightmares are usually about losing you he says im okay once i realize youre here

come sleep with me we wont make love love will make us

sometimes i wonder if theres something wrong with me perhaps ive spent too long in the company of my literary romantic heroes and consequently my ideals and expectations are far too high

you’re dangerous he says

why

because you make me believe in the impossible

the very first moment i beheld him my heart was irrevocably gone

i wonder how many people dont get the one they want but end up with the one theyre supposed to be with

i’ve been fighting to be who i am all my life what’s the point of being who i am if i can’t have the person who was worth all the fighting for

when one is in love one always begins by deceiving ones self and one always ends by deceiving others that is what the world calls a romance

my only love sprung from my only hate

too early seen unknown and known too late

prodigious birth of love it is to me

that i must love a loathed enemy

the heart is an arrow it demands aim to land true

romance is the glamour which turns the dust of everyday life into a golden haze

sometimes when im alone i take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train the kisses in the arena

thus with a kiss i die

sometimes you wake up from a dream sometimes you wake up in a dream and sometimes every once in a while you wake up in someone elses dream

in our time together you claimed a special place in my heart one ill carry with me forever and that no one can ever replace

so it’s true when all is said and done grief is the price we pay for love

moments when lost cant be found again theyre just gone

romance is thinking about your significant other when you are supposed to be thinking about something else

she wanted something else something different something more passion and romance perhaps or maybe quiet conversations in candlelit rooms or perhaps something as simple as not being second

its bullshit to think of friendship and romance as being different theyre not theyre just variations of the same love variations of the same desire to be close

i belong to my beloved and my beloved is mine

when it comes to men who are romantically interested in you it’s really simple just ignore everything they say and only pay attention to what they do

the fact is i love him hes the boy i want and one day hell be mine

oh no dont smile youll kill me i stop breathing when you smile

those sweet lips my oh my i could kiss those lips all night long

good things come to those who wait

one cant fight with oneself for this battle has only one loser

if you can capture a womans imagination then you will have her but imagination is a strange creature it needs time and distance to function properly

you are speaking of my future lover be more respectful

ye are blood of my blood and bone of my bone

i give ye my body that we two might be one

i give ye my spirit til our life shall be done

you really love her dont you she said

with all my heart

she looked as sad as id ever seen her

whats your heart telling you to do

i dont know

maybe she said gentlyyoure trying to hard to hear it

he sighed the clouds i can handle but i cant fight with an eclipse

i honestly have no idea how to live without you

for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo

if i die i will wait for you do you understand no matter how long i will watch from beyond to make sure you live every year you have to its fullest and then we’ll have so much to talk about when i see you again… bones

love is a luxury

no love is an element

an element like air to breathe earth to stand on

damn me to hell or take me to heaven but for gods sake do it now

you wanted hearts and flowers he murmurs

i blink at him not quite believing what i’m seeing

you have my heart and he waves toward the room

and here are the flowers i whisper completing his sentence christian it’s lovely

it is an absolute human certainty that no one can know his own beauty or perceive a sense of his own worth until it has been reflected back to him in the mirror of another loving caring human being

oh aye sassenach i am your master    and youre mine seems i canna possess your soul without losing my own

dont get your panties in such a twist and give me back mine

we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him

you always get more respect when you dont have a happy ending

does this mean you’re going to make love to me tonight christian holy shit did i just say that his mouth drops open slightly but he recovers quickly

no anastasia it doesn’t firstly i don’t make love i fuck… hard secondly there’s a lot more paperwork to do and thirdly you don’t yet know what you’re in for you could still run for the hills come i want to show you my playroom

my mouth drops open fuck hard holy shit that sounds so… hot but why are we looking at a playroom i am mystified

you want to play on your xbox i ask he laughs loudly

no anastasia no xbox no playstation come… producing a key from his pocket he unlocks yet another door and takes a deep breath

you can leave anytime the helicopter is on standby to take you whenever you want to go you can stay the night and go home in the morning it’s fine whatever you decide

just open the damn door christian

he opens the door and stands back to let me in i gaze at him once more i so want to know what’s in here taking a deep breath i walk in

and it feels like i’ve timetraveled back to the sixteenth century and the spanish inquisition

if a man wants you nothing can keep him away if he doesnt want you nothing can make him stay

dont leave a piece of jewelry at his house so you can go back and get it later he may be with his real girlfriend

falling for him would be like cliff diving it would be either the most exhilarating thing that ever happened to me or the stupidest mistake i’d ever make

one day when i am a braver man i will tell her these things and then i will look her in the eye tell her i love her and ask her to be only mine but until that day were just friends

romance novels are birthday cake and life is often peanut butter and jelly i think everyone should have lots of delicious romance novels lying around for those times when the peanut butter of life gets stuck to the roof of your mouth

it is a long way to ireland janet and i am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels but if i cant do better how is it to be helped are you anything akin to me do you think jane

i could risk no sort of answer by this time my heart was still

we kiss all the time i clear my throat then add we justdo it in private

a smug expression crosses his face i dont buy it for a second cause if you were my girlfriend and a stud like me was livin in your house id kiss you in front of the guy every chance i got as a reminder

a reminder of wwwhat

that you were mine

kissing  and i mean like yummy smacking kissing  is the most delicious most beautiful and passionate thing that two people can do bar none better than sex hands down

no no i dont believe youd betray me with her i dont believe youd cheat on me but im afraid and im sick in my heart that you might look at her then at me and regret

nerd girls are the world’s most underutilized romantic resource and guys do not tell me that nerd girls are not hot because that shows a paris hiltonesque failure to understand hotness

if i let myself love you i wont throw myself in front of her ill throw myself in front of you

id love to she finally saidon one condition

i steadied myself hoping it wasnt something too awful

you have to promise that you wont fall in love with me

i knew she was kidding me by the way she laughed and i couldnt help but breathe a sigh of relief

sometimes i had to admit jamie had a pretty good sense of humor

i smiled and gave her my word

dont kiss me like a woman if youre going to treat me like a child

ever since i’ve met you i’ve wanted to break every rule aiden turned away the muscles in his neck tensing he sighed you’ll become the centre of someone’s world one day and he’ll be the luckiest son of a bitch on this earth

and annabeth continued it reminds me how long we’ve known each other we were twelve percy can you believe that

no he admitted so…you knew you liked me from that moment

she smirked i hated you at first you annoyed me then i tolerated you for a few years then—

she leaned in and kissed him a good proper kiss without anyone watching—no romans anywhere no screaming satyr chaperones

she pulled away i missed you percy

percy wanted to tell her the same thing but it seemed too small a comment while he had been on the roman side he’d kept himself alive almost solely by thinking of annabeth i missed you didn’t really cover that

there is a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven

a time to be born and a time to die

a time to plant and a time to uproot

a time to kill and a time to heal

a time to tear down and a time to build

a time to weep and a time to laugh

a time to mourn and a time to dance

a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them

a time to embrace and a time to refrain

a time to search and a time to give up

a time to keep and a time to throw away

a time to tear and a time to mend

a time to be silent and a time to speak

a time to love and a time to hate

a time for war and a time for peace

my heart only ever had one thought one want one need despite all in spite of allall my heart has ever wanted is you

do you want to know why men name their penis so the most important decisions in their life arent made by a stranger

i felt like an animal and animals don’t know sin do they

every woman wants a man wholl fall in love with her soul as well as her body

what you are is a fucking tragedy simon snow you literally couldnt be a bigger mess

he tries to kiss me but i pull back and you like that

i love it he says

why

because we match

to fall in love with god is the greatest romance to seek him the greatest adventure to find him the greatest human achievement

why do people always assume that volume will succeed when logic won’t  damon

what about when someone doesnt need a shoulder what if they need the arms

well that depends i suppose i heard someone once say that men dance the same way they have sex so if you want everyone here to think youre the kind of guy who just sits around and—

he stood up lets dance

you don’t take away my choices you are my choice

you picked a lemon throw it away lemonade is overrated freaks should remain at the circus not in your apartment you already have one asshole you don’t need another make a space in your life for the glorious things you deserve have faith

you were just worried about me

an exhale relieved that i had understood yeah

i turned because you think im worth it

he put his fingers under my chin i absolutely think your worth it

but you dont think you are

his mouth opened shut

thats what this is about derek you wont let us worry about you because you dont think youre worth it but i do i absolutely do

but  but what if i hit you

a snort you’re not going to hit me

how do you know i bristled at his amused tone i could hit you even master swordsmen make mistakes i could get a lucky shot or you might not see me coming i don’t want to hurt you

he favored me with another patient look and how much experience do you have with swords and weapons in general

um i glanced down at the saber in my hand thirty seconds

he smiled that calm irritatingly confident smirk you’re not going to hit me

memories were fine but you couldnt touch them smell them or hold them they were never exactly as the moment was and they faded with time

carpe scrotum seize life by the testicles

some people claim that marriage interferes with romance theres no doubt about it anytime you have a romance your wife is bound to interfere

he did not care if she was heartless vicious and vulgar stupid and grasping he loved her he would rather have misery with one than happiness with the other

i have tried to let you go and i cannot i cannot stop thinking of you i cannot stop dreaming about you

what if you find your soul mate at the wrong time

its only terrible to have nothing to wait for

you sneaked into my cabin

annabeth rolled her eyes percy you’ll be seventeen in two months you can’t seriously be worried about getting in trouble with coach hedge

uh have you seen his baseball bat

besides seaweed brain i just thought we could take a walk we haven’t had any time to be together alone i want to show you something—my favorite place aboard the ship

percy’s pulse was still in overdrive but it wasn’t from fear of getting in trouble can i you know brush my teeth first

youd better annabeth said because i’m not kissing you until you do and brush your hair while you’re at it

she smiled and her eyes started to drift downward

back up to his eyes

you know that im falling in love with you right

what a luxury it was for people to hold their loved ones whenever they wanted

i seem to have run in a great circle and met myself again on the starting line

i dont think we get a choice in who we fall for ian whispers i think we just do

so i placed my heart under lock and key

to take some time and take care of me

but i turn around and youre standing here

oh lizzy do anything rather than marry without affection

stay with me

vday…if you need this one day in a year to show everyone else you truly care for your loved one i think it’s quite stupid i hate this commercialism it’s all artificial and has nothing to do with real love

statistically speaking there is a  percent chance that the love of your life is having an affair be very suspicious

just because im not forever by your side doesnt mean thats not precisely where i want to be

youre supposed to say all i want is your happiness ill do whatever it takes even if it means being without you

sorry noah said im just not that big of a person

the first time hed held her hand it felt so good that it crowded out all the bad things it felt better than anything had ever hurt

he was contemplation and enthusiasm ambition and strong coffee i could have looked at him forever

blood of my blood he whispered and bone of my bone you carry me within ye claire and ye canna leave me now no matter what happens you are mine always if ye will it or no if ye want me or nay mine and i wilna let ye go

love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs

when you loved someone and had to let them go there will always be that small part of yourself that whispers what was it that you wanted and why didnt you fight for it

things work out the way theyre meant to

the fact is…i’m in love with you and i have been for some time

i want you under me on your back

im sorry you deserve more respect than that but i cant stop thinking of it your arms and legs around me your mouth open for my kisses i need too much of you a lifetime of nights spent between your thighs wouldnt be enough

i want to talk with you forever i remember every word youve ever said to me

if only i could visit you as a foreigner goes into a new country learn the language of you wander past all borders into every private and secret place i would stay forever i would become a citizen of you

and there it stopped

i require three things in a man he must be handsome ruthless and stupid

like some wines our love could neither mature nor travel

he is my world and my world is him and without him there is no world

youre a hero and a gentleman youre kind and honest but more than that youre the first man i ever truly loved and no matter what the future brings you always will be and i know that my life is better for it

your hand

this is how

thats when you know for sure somebody loves you they figure out what you need and they give it to you  without you asking

no problem gale replies i wake up ten times a night anyway

to make sure katniss is still here asks peeta

something like that

that was funny what tigris said about no one knowing what to do with her

well we never have

she loves you you know says peeta she as good as told me after they whipped you

dont believe itgale answers the way she kissed you in the quarter quellwell she never kissed me like that

it was just part of the show peeta tells him although theres an edge of doubt in his voice

no you won her over gave up everything for her maybe thats the only way to convince her you love her theres a long pause i should have volunteered to take your place in the first games protected her then

you couldnt says peeta shed never have forgiven you you had to take care of her family they matter more to her than her life

i wonder how shell make up her mind

oh that i do know i can just catch gales last words through the layer of fur katniss will pick whoever she thinks she cant survive without

i get in that kind of situation all the time comrade its not a big deal anger replaced my fear i didnt like being treated like a child

stop calling me that you dont even know what youre talking about

sure i do i had to do a report on the rssr last year

because you are the superhero fledgling i’m just your more attractive sidekick oh and the herd of nerds are your dorky minions

annabeth he said hesitantly in new rome demigods can live their whole lives in peace

her expression turned guarded reyna explained it to me but percy you belong at camp halfblood that other life—

it was hard to tell in the golden light but he thought annabeth was blushing oh she said…

i’m sorry he said i just…i had to think of that to keep going to give me hope forget i mentioned—

no she said gods percy that’s so sweet

there is a desire within each of us

in the deep center of ourselves

that we call our heart

we were born with it

it is never completely satisfied

and it never dies

we are often unaware of it

but it is always awake

it is the human desire for love

every person in this earth yearns to love

to be loved to know love

our true identity our reason for being

is to be found in this desire

love is the why of life

why we are functioning at all

i am convinced

it is the fundamental energy

of the human spirit

the fuel on which we run

the wellspring of our vitality

and grace

which is the flowing

creative activity of love itself

is what makes all goodness possible

love should come first

it should be the beginning of

and the reason for everything

we ruined each other by being together we destroyed each other’s dreams

i decided to find you throw myself at your feet and beg you to have mercy on me honestly i’ll accept whatever you choose kelsey just don’t ask me to live apart from you again becausei can’t

love is too precious to be ashamed of

we stood there looking at each other saying nothing but it was the kind of nothing that meant everything in his eyes there was no trace of what had happened between us earlier and i could feel something inside me break

so that was that we were finally finally over

i looked at him and i felt so sad because this thought occurred to me i will never look at you the same way again ill never be that girl again the girl who comes running back every time you push her away the girl who loves you anyway

i couldn’t even be mad at him because this was who he was this was who he’d

always been he’d never lied about that he gave and then he took away i felt it in the pit of my stomach the familiar ache that lost regretful feeling only he could give me i never wanted to feel it again never ever

maybe this was why i came so i could really know so i could say goodbye

i looked at him and i thought if i was very brave or very honest i would tell him

i would say it so he would know it and i would know it and i could never take it back but i wasn’t that brave or honest so all i did was look at him and i think he knew anyway

i release you i evict you from my heart because if i dont do it now i never will

i was the one to look away first

romance takes place in the middle distance romance is looking in at yourself through a window clouded with dew romance means leaving things out where life grunts and shuffles romance only sighs

and then there are the rare ones who know love who understand it who freely give of themselves demanding only a return of that lovethat trust

relationships are all about trust and equality if one person shares then the other person should share too

i hug him tightly i can’t imagine my life without you christian i love you so much it frightens me me too he breathes my life would be empty without you i love you so much

that night when you kissed me i left a poem in your mouth and you can hear some of the lines every time you breathe out

ive been in love with you since the very beginning you asked why there isnt anyone else in my life and the reason is you

whatever happened to the dragon

i mustered my primmest tone he has a name you know

adrian pulled back and gave me a curious look i didnt know actually whatd you decide on

hopper when adrian laughed i added best rabbit ever hed be proud to know his name is being passed on

yes im sure he would did you name the mustang too

i think you mean the ivashkinator

he stared at me in wonder i told you i loved you right

yes i assured him many times

but love i’ve come to understand is more than three words mumbled before bedtime love is sustained by action a pattern of devotion in the things we do for each other every day

it was the nicest thing she could imagine it made her want to have his babies and give him both of her kidneys

my head’ll explode if i continue with this escapism

cut the ending revise the script the man of her dreams is a girl

peeta i say lightly you said at the interview you’d had a crush on me forever when did forever start

oh let’s see i guess the first day of school we were five you had on a red plaid dress and your hair it was in two braids instead of one my father pointed you out when we were waiting to line up peeta says

your father why i ask

he said ‘see that little girl i wanted to marry her mother but she ran off with a coal miner’ peeta says

what you’re making that up i exclaim

no true story peeta says and i said ‘a coal miner why did she want a coal miner if she could’ve had you’ and he said ‘because when he sings even the birds stop to listen’

so that day in music assembly the teacher asked who knew the valley song your hand shot right up in the air she stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us and i swear every bird outside the windows fell silent peeta says

no it happened and right when your song ended i knew—just like your mother—i was a goner peeta says then for the next eleven years i tried to work up the nerve to talk to you

it would explain another thing too why peeta took a beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day so if those details are true could it all be true

you have a remarkable memory i say haltingly i remember everything about you says peeta tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear you’re the one who wasn’t paying attention

i am now i say

well i don’t have much competition here he says i want to draw away to close those shutters again but i know i can’t it’s as if i can hear haymitch whispering in my ear say it say it

i swallow hard and get the words out you don’t have much competition anywhere and this time it’s me who leans in

attraction is not an option

before i fell

in love with words

with setting skies

and singing birds—

it was you i fell

in love with first

i was as unburdened as a piece of dandelion fluff and he was the wind that stirred me about the world

he placed his hands

on my mind

before reaching

for my waist

my hips

or my lips

he didnt call me

he called me

how he touches me

were you always such a stubborn blind obtuse girl

are you calling me stupid

yes but in a more poetic way

well here’s a poem for you get lost

had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly

know that love is truly timeless

i crossed a thousand leagues to come to you and lost the best part of me along the way dont tell me to leave

never say no when you really want to say yes

i dont want to be somebodys crush if somebody likes me i want them to like the real me not what they think i am

for thousands of nights i dreamed of making love to you no man on earth has ever hated sunrise as i do

do you think theres a difference between belonging with and belonging to

what are you doing

kneeling before a goddess

i’m not a goddess

you are a goddess a princess a queen as a soldier i pledge myself to your service as a prince i grant you any boon within my power as a man i ask to sit at your feet and worship you ask me to do anything for you and i will do it

you know on tv when there’s one of those awkward shocking moments and all you hear are the crickets in the background

well chirp fucking chirpthis is one of those moments

deceiving others that is what the world calls a romance

its so much easier to convince yourself youre madly in love with someone when you know nothing about him

i have named you queen

there are taller than you taller

there are purer than you purer

there are lovelier than you lovelier

but you are the queen

when you go through the streets

no one recognizes you

no one sees your crystal crown no one looks

at the carpet of red gold

that you tread as you pass

the nonexistent carpet

and when you appear

all the rivers sound

in my body bells

shake the sky

and a hymn fills the world

only you and i

only you and i my love

listen to it

by the way i havent heard an im sorry from you yet my sense of grievance had overwhelmed my sense of selfpreservation

i am sorry that the maenad picked on you

i glared at him not enough i said i was trying hard to hang on to this conversation

angelic sookie vision of love and beauty i am prostrate that the wicked evil maenad violated your smooth and voluptuous body in an attempt to deliver a message to me

thats more like it

a girl can still admire can’t she even those who can’t afford to go in the store can still windowshop right knowing he wasn’t for me didn’t mean i couldn’t covet the merchandise

you know that when i hate you it is because i love you to a point of passion that unhinges my soul

hes still looking in my eyes staring me down like he did that dragon chin tilted and locked im not the chosen one he says

i meet his gaze and sneer my arm is a steel band around his waist i choose you i say simon snow i choose you

he was now in that state of fire that she loved she wanted to be burnt

his lips tasted cool and sharp peppermint winter but his hands soft on the back of my neck promised long days and summer and forever

i wanted to be his life preserver the thing that would keep him afloat instead he became my anchor and i’m tired of drowning

love like everything else in life should be a discovery an adventure and like most adventures you don’t know you’re having one until you’re right in the middle of it

i would rather a romantic relationship turn into contempt than turn into apathy the passion in the extremities make it appear as though it once meant something we grow from hot or cold but lukewarm is the biggest insult

believe me im no romantic and while ive heard all about love at first sight ive never believed in it and i still dont but even so there was something there something recognizably real and i couldnt look away

love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame

i couldnt stop staring at his mouth when he spoke i bet he knew how to kiss perfect kisses too ones that werent wet and gross but the kind that curled toes

i needed to stop looking at him in general

i would lay down everything i possess even my soul for you if that isnt love its the best i have

too bad guys aren’t like mr potato head where you can pick and choose which parts you want then we might come up with a guy who meets your standards

but i couldnt help myself couldnt help the way i felt as i recalled the bliss and rush of a vampires bite

i didnt want it to be one good memory that led to a lot of bad ones i wanted it to stay what it was one amazing moment something that was strong and sweet enough to stand on its own something i could remember without any pain

nice dress take it off

as a man i instantly became aware of the gold in her hair her height measured against mine and how easily shed fit in my arms ren

i knew from the moment i heard you the moment i saw the gun and realized that this lovely petit woman was the executioner that you would never die waiting for me to save you  that you would save yourself

i couldnt escape him now or ever hed always be there consuming my every thought my heart locked in his hands i was drawn to him by forces i couldnt control let alone escape

mr bradford she said im not going to propose to you

the twinkle in mr bradfords eyes faded so did his smile he managed to keep it on his face it looked painful

oh he said

would you mind it so very much ifyou knowyou proposed to me

the light in mr bradfords eyes jumped to life he beamed so largely it almost wasnt crooked

if you want

she loved him but he didn’t know how to love

he could talk about love he could see love and feel love but he couldn’t give love

he could make love but he couldn’t make promises

she had desperately wanted his promises

she wanted his heart knew she couldn’t have it so she took what she could get

temporary bliss passionate highs and lows withdrawal and manipulation

he only stayed long enough to take what he needed and keep moving

if he stopped moving he would selfdestruct

if he stopped wandering he would have to face himself

he chose to stay in the dark where he couldn’t see

if he exposed himself and the sun came out he’d see his shadow

he was deathly afraid of his shadow

she saw his shadow loved it understood it saw potential in it

she thought her love would change him

he pushed and he pulled tested boundaries thinking she would never leave

he knew he was hurting her but didn’t know how to share anything but pain

he was only comfortable in chaos claiming souls before they could claim him

her love her body she had given to him and he’d taken with such feigned sincerity absorbing every drop of her

his dark heart concealed

she’d let him enter her spirit and stroke her soul where everything is love and sensation and surrender

wide open exposed to deception

it had never occurred to her that this desire was not love

it was blinding the way she wanted him

she couldn’t see what was really happening only what she wanted to happen

she suspected that he would always seek to minimize the risk of being split open his secrets revealed

he valued his soul’s privacy far more than he valued the intimacy of sincere connection so he kept his distance at any and all costs

intimacy would lead to his undoing—in his mind an irrational and indulgent mistake

when she discovered his indiscretions she threw love in his face and beat him with it

somewhere deep down in her labyrinth her intricacy the darkest part of her soul she relished the mayhem

she felt a sense of privilege for having such passion in her life

he stirred her core

the place she dared not enter

the place she could not stir for herself

but something wasn’t right

his eyes were cold and dark

his energy unaffected

he laughed at her and her antics told her she was a mess

frantic she looked for love hiding in his eyes in his face in his stance and she found nothing but disdain

and her heart stopped

if i had a camera i said id take a picture of you every day that way id remember how you looked every single day of your life

i look exactly the same

no you dont youre changing all the time every day a tiny bit if i could id keep a record of it all

if youre so smart how did i change today

you got a fraction of a millimeter taller for one thing your hair grew a fraction of a millimeter longer and your breasts grew a fraction of a—

they did not

yes they did

did not

did too

what else you big pig

you got a little happier and also a little sadder

meaning they cancel out each other leaving me exactly the same

how do you know

think about it have you ever been happier or sadder than right now lying here in this grass

i guess not no

and have you ever been sadder

no

it isnt like that for everyone you know some people

what about you are you the happiest and saddest right now that youve ever

been

of course i am

why

because nothing makes me happier and nothing makes me sadder than you

you know what they say about boys next door

sam laughed a funny selfdeprecating laugh you did read a lot and spent too much time just inside the kitchen window where i couldnt see you very well

and not enough time mostly naked in front of my bedroom window i teased

sam turned bright red that he said is so not the point of this conversation

after a moment wrath turned to john this is lassiter the fallen angel one of the last times he was here on earth there was a plague in central europe

okay that was so not my fault

which wiped out twothirds of the human population

id like to remind you that you dont like humans

they smell bad when theyre dead

all you mortal types do

my beloved is the sun

and i am the earth that thrives only in her warmth my beloved is the rain

and i am the grass that thirsts for her quenching kiss my beloved is the wind

and i am the wings that soar when she fills me with her gentle strength

my beloved is the rock

upon which rests the happiness of all my days

—the elements of love a poem by aileron ven kavali of the fey

but my god its so beautiful when the boy smiles

and second keep in mind that you are a weapon in theory when youre done with training you should be able to kick a hole in a wall or knock out a moose with a single punch

i would never hit a moose said clary theyre endangered

your absence has not taught me to be alone it merely has shown that when together we cast a single shadow on the wall

his hands are saying that he wants to hold her his feet are saying that he wants to chase after her hes probably forgotten that im here beside him

you are more to me than any of them has any idea you are the atmosphere of beauty through which i see life you are the incarnation of all lovely thingsi think of you day and night  letter to lord alfred bosie douglas

our relationship wasnt the sun the moon the stars but it wasnt bullshit either

id rather die on my own terms than live on theirs id rather die loving alex than live without him

hale was hale and not knowing what the ws stood for had become a constant reminder to kat that in life there are some things that can be given but never stolen

of course that didnt stop her from trying

we live in a dark and romantic and quite tragic world

you didn’t think i’d let you go alone did you

no but i’m grateful that i had you with me

grateful is all i’m going to get isn’t it

what else were you hoping for

adoration devotion affection infatuation or just plain finding me irresistible

sorry don juan you’ll have to live with my undying gratitude

there are some experiences in life they havent invented the right words for

let me rephrase he took a seething step toward me when it comes to you… i don’t like to share

the more a person pushes others away the clearer it becomes he is in need of love the most

as a girl she had come to believe in the ideal man  the prince or knight of her childhood stories in the real world however men like that simply didnt exist

ill find you dont worry my body wont be with you all the time but youll always have my heart im your worrier remember

ill never forget i promise im your high priestess and youve pledged yourself to me that means you have my heart too

then both of us better stay safe a hearts a hard thing to live without i should know ive tried it

find the things that matter and hold on to them and fight for them and refuse to let them go

i knew you would do me good in some way at some time i saw it in your eyes when i first beheld you their expression and smile did not again he stopped did not he proceeded hastily strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing

are you sure that being like everybody else will make you happy

i dont know any other way

let me show you

i dont care where i come from or who you are i can make you happy and you make me happy we could have a happily ever after

good men are often more practical than pretty  said mother andrius just happens to be both

the door banged open and eve rushed out flushed and mussed and still buttoning her shirt its not what you think she said it was just—oh okay whatever it was exactly what you think now what

i make love with a focus and intensity that most people reserve for sleep

maybe you could be mine  or maybe we’ll be entwined  aimless in this sexless foreplay

everyones a little crazy some people just hide it better than others

her heart had grown so familiar to the pain of life without him that to respond now seemed too large a pleasure she could not endure if pain was love then she loved fiercely yet knew she could not be near that boy again

hey our hairs the same color i said eying us side by side in the mirror

sure is girlfriend eric grinned at me

no one compares to you but theres no you except in my dreams tonight

shed secretly had a crush on him since they were twelve years old last summer shed fallen for him hard

i was his exception and as much as i had tried to fight my feelings he was mine

you had to be willing to fight in order for a love story to last a life time

a real relationship is twoway

she craved a tall glass of the freshsqueezed lemonade from the pitcher she’d left chilling in the fridge two glasses served with a generous slice of pound cake with orange glaze icing sounded twice as nice

plan b ivy said what is plan b

jenks reddened grab the fish and run like hell he muttered and i almost giggled

please touch me i pray

why is he scared of the dark

i meant the words for a joke but shade nodded seriously like all monsters because it reminds him of what he truly is

of course silly me such a sad exciting score which no doubt you can play so many accomplishments mr grey

and the greatest one is you miss steele

take my hand and well make it  i swear

a lot of men wouldnt like being called a romantic its not macho enough

i am as wrapped up in her as a vine that clings to a tree seeking for sustenance she’s tied me to her for eternity she’s my home she’s my reason for being to win and hold her heart is my only purpose

have i told you how hideous you look tonight cardan asks leaning back in the elaborately carved chair the warmth of his words turning the question into something like a compliment

no i say glad to be annoyed back into the present tell me

i cant

unless you stop him perhaps next we meet

youll be just as annoying i guessed

he fixed my with those warm brown eyes or perhaps you could bring me up to speed on those modern courtship rituals

i sat there stunned until he gave me a glimpse of a smilejust enough to let me know he was teasing then he disappeared

oh very funny i yelled

when would he learn that women never stayed where you put them

that this girl would know exactly how to shatter me

if i werent standing next to your boyfriend id be tempted to ask you out myself

she blushes and st clair bounds inside the box office and wrestles her into a hug miiiiiiiiine he says

cut it out anna pushes him off laughing youll get fired and then ill have to support your sorry arse for the rest of our lives

if you love someone why would you want that person to change

love is a game

for the next x or o

vampires honestly theyre like children sometimes

get up shahrzad alkhayzuran you kneel before no one least of all me

poor fellow i think he is in love with you

you are what happiness means to me and i would rather have today with you than forever with anyone else

i’ve never been the one not for anybody

he closed the distance between them

you’ll get used to it he tipped her face up to his kissed her

why why am i the one

because my life opened up and it flooded with color when you walked back into it

in the philippines a whole layer of criminals exists who consider that it is their right to rob you unhindered if you thwart their wicked desires to their way of thinking you have stolen from them and are evil

theres honest and dishonest corruption in this country

dont enjoy it too much for its what we love that usually kills us

the good guys dont always win wars but the winners always make sure that they go down in history as the good guys

the philippines is like a woman you love her and hate her at the same time

i never believed in all my born days that ideas of truth and justice were only pretty words to brighten a much darker and more ubiquitous reality

didnt your mother ever tell you never to trust a man who doesnt drink

he shrank from hearing margarets very name mentioned he while he blamed her – while he was jealous of her – while he renounced her – he loved her sorely in spite of himself

he ranger stopped in front of my parents house and we both looked to the door my mother and my grandmother were standing there watching us

im not sure i feel comfortable about the way your grandma looks at me ranger said

stephanie she wants to see you naked

i wish you hadnt told me that babe

everyone i know wants to see you naked

and you

never crossed my mind i held my breath when i said it and i hoped god wouldnt stike me down dead for lying

women were supposed to be the enigmas but men moody brooding bastards the lot of them a woman with pms had nothing on a man where women might get hormonal once a month men suffered their own brand of pms on a daily basis

usually my form of turning someone down was shoving a stake through his heart while smirking gotcha

with a chaste heart

with pure eyes i celebrate your beauty

holding the leash of blood

so that it might leap out and trace your outline

where you lie down in my ode

as in a land of forests or in surf

in aromatic loam or in sea music

equally beautiful your feet

arched by primeval tap of wind or sound

your ears small shells

of the splendid american sea

your breasts of level plentitude

fulfilled by living light

your flying eyelids of wheat

revealing or enclosing

the two deep countries of your eyes

the line your shoulders have divided into pale regions

loses itself and blends into the compact halves of an apple

continues separating your beauty down into two columns of

to sink into the two grapes of your feet

where your twin symmetrical tree burns again and rises

over the pact of sea and earth

from what materials

did your body come together

swelling like baking bread to signal silvered hills

the cleavage of one petal

until alone remained

the fine and firm feminine form

it is not only light that falls over the world spreading inside your body

yet suffocate itself

so much is clarity

taking its leave of you

as if you were on fire within

the moon lives in the lining of your skin

having sex multiple times on the first sleepover does not count as more than one date…

maybe sometimes we can only see the truth about ourselves if someone shows us where to look

i would prefer a sword to fight duel but a pen to plan a war

it was finally becoming clear to her that love wasnt about finding someone perfect to marry love was about seeing through to the truth of a person and accepting all their shades of light and dark love was an ability

he kissed me again farther up my neck and i pushed him back against the wall

my mind searched for the logical thought a rational life raft before i drowned in wanting to hiss him i managed weve only met a few days ago we dont know each other

luke released me how long does it take to know someone

he took my fingers playing with them in between his own ill wait he looked so good in the halflight under the trees his light eyes nearly glowing against his shadowed skin it was useless

i dont want you to i whispered the words and before id even finished saying them his mouth was on mine and i was melting under his lips

a quiet but indomitable voice behind me said i believe this is my dance it was him i could feel his presence the warmth of him seeped into my back and i quivered all over like spring leaves in a warm breeze

lately i cant help wanting us

to be like other people

for example if i were a smoker

youd lift a match to the cigarette

just as i put it between my lips

its never been like that

between us none of that

easy chemistry no quick half automatic

flares everything between us

had to be learned

behind my book all my fantasies

of seduction run up

against the rocks

tell me again

why you dont like

sex in the afternoon

no dont tell me

ill never understand you

never understand us americas strangest

loving couple they never

and rarely look at each other

into each others eyes i mean

i feel…and i have reason to believe…that we could come to mean something to each other

it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love

there is darkness in light there is pain in joy and there are thorns on the rose

v shook his head remember what you saw in that clearing cop how’d you like that anywhere near a female you loved

butch put down the bud without drinking from it his eyes traveled over rhage’s body

we’re going to need a shitload of steel the human muttered

he smiled at that and then his gaze shifted to a spot over my shoulder and it faded these doubts wouldn’t have anything to do with the company you’re keeping of late would they

i didn’t get a chance to answer before the shop door was thrown open and a furious war mage stomped in pritkin spotted me and his eyes narrowed

you shaved my legs

mircea looked at me and folded his arms across his chest i looked from one unhappy face to the other and suddenly remembered that i had somewhere else to be

god our knees touching isnt enough i need more

shes knotting her fingers together on her lap as if she doesnt know what to do with them i want to touch her but what if she pulls away like before ive never been such a wuss with a girl in my life

i bite my bottom lip as i slide my hand about millionth of a millimeter closer to her hand

she doesnt seem fazed so i move closer and closer

when the tips of my fingers touch her wrist she freezes but she doesnt jerk her hand away god her skin is so soft i think as my fingers trail a path from her wrist to her knuckles to her smooth manicured nails

with a slight shift of my hand i lace my fingers through hers

im holding hands with maggie armstrong

the bus stops suddenly and i look out the window its our stop she must have realized this because she pulls her hand away from mine and stands i follow behind still reeling

your memory feels like home to me

so whenever my mind wanders it always finds it’s way back to you

she had been forced into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning

yeah tell me i’m a bottle of single malt scotch she thought that’s the way to my heart

come on it’s an american tradition apple soup mom’s homemade chicken pie

she chuckled in spite of herself then winced it’s apple pie and mom’s homemade chicken soup but you didn’t do badly for a start

when you decide you want to be with someone forever you want forever to start right now

there was nowhere i could go that wouldnt be you

i been watchin you workin day and night slavin so hard you barely have time to catch your breath people do that for three reasons either they crazy or stupid or tryin to forget

i believe the stars align so souls can find one another whether they are meant to be souls in love or souls in life remains to be seen

why is everything always my decision i asked

because you will not tolerate anything else

oh i remembered now great i whispered

anita to jeanclaude

true love is finding your soulmate in your best friend

the trick is finding a person whose flaws dont drive you crazyyou knowsomeone whose flaws you can live withsomeone who can stand your flaws too

agreed i say its going to be a long hour

maybe not that long says peeta what was that you were saying just before the food arrived something about me  no competition  best thing that ever happened to you

i dont remember that last part i say hoping its too dim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush

oh thats right thats what i was thinking he says  scoot over im freezing

youre a dream like everything else

his hand glides down my arm folds over my hand his fingers lace with mine palms kissing i can feel the fast thud of his heart through this single touch

i want him to love me as much as i love him

your voice sounds like a midnight fire all warm and worn in and golden i could listen to you talk forever

i could never do that

she laughed at him he brought his lips to her ear

your scent is like violets early in spring he whispered then he laughed at himself because though it was true he sounded like the worst kind of fool

i’ve been working hard to become the kind of man she needs the kind of man she already believes me to be

does that count as an argument can we kiss and make up now

it was only half an argument

fine then you kiss and i’ll make up

i laughed until he effectively shut me up with his lips

okay then i’ll just say i love you there is nothing in this world more important to me than you are i’m only content when you’re near my whole purpose is to be what you need me to be it’s not poetry but it’s from my heart will that do

we all know interspecies romance is weird

a gentleman holds my hand

a man pulls my hair

a soulmate will do both

will put his hand on nicos shoulder nico we need o have another talk about your people skills

hey im just stating the obvious if this is apollo and he dies were all in trouble

will turned to me i apologize for my boyfriend

would you prefer special guy will asked or significant other

significant annoyance in your case nico grumbled

tell you what you let me go and i’ll ask you plenty of questions about your race until then i’m slightly distracted with how this little vacation on the good ship holy sht is going to pan out for me

mine was the twilight and the morning mine was a world of rooftops and love songs

she was an idiot an adorable gorgeous feisty funny sweet sexy idiot

it was heartfelt it was heartbreaking it was extreme joy it was bonecrushing grief it was fiery hot it was icycold it was true love sprouting it was true love dying

its like we were both trying to hold onto something that was slipping through our fingers and we didnt understand why

if i looked like him tara said i’d want to have sex with myself all the time

when what you want is a relationship and not a person get a dog

i cant imagine a romance novel published today where the hero rapes the heroine and she falls in love with him

listen carefully id crush you like a bug for causing my wife one single moment of pain believe it fear it

do you think we can be friends i asked

he stared up at the ceiling probably not but we can pretend

what made me run away was doubtless not so much the fear of settling down but of settling down permanently in something ugly

two seconds later the sound of an alarm filled my ears

what did you do i said over the noise as he backed up towards the bathroom door

the girl who gave you the note

i caught her staring at my lighter

i blinked you gave a child in a psych ward  a lighter

his eyes crinkled at the corners she seemed trustworthy

youre sick i said but smiled

hey nobodys perfect  noah smiled back

i could feel the warmth of his presence as if a soft blanket had been wrapped around my soul around my heart it held me and protected me it sheltered me and i knew i wasn’t alone anymore

she moved to pinch me again but i blocked her hand im no expert on girls but when one tries to pinch you four times im pretty sure thats flirting

three years thats a thousand tomorrows maam

youve maddened me for youhave changed everything so im going to fck you long and hard beauty because if im to be enslaved by youi want to be your master as well

he put the knuckles of his fist to the table leaned toward niles and spoke quietly cuttingly in his rough gravelly voice

yes men are pigs except your brother of course hes actually a decent human being almost a woman

jillians mother

the cord pulled taut and she rebounded flying back up before falling again as her velocity slowed she opened her eyes and found herself dangling at the end of the cord about five feet above jace he was grinning

nice he said as graceful as a falling snowflake

was i screaming she asked genuinely curious you know on the way down

he nodded thankfully no ones home or they would have assumed i was murdering you

ha you cant even reach me she kicked out a leg and spun lazily in midair

jaces eyes glinted want to bet

clary knew that expression no she said quickly whatever youre going to do

now he said that was much better you didnt scream at all

i didnt get the chance she was breathless and not just from the impact of the fall being sprawled on top of jace feeling his body against hers made her hands shake and her heart beat faster

what he did to my heart was sheer inexplicable magic

life is fragile and temporary the faces of today quickly become the faces of the past sorrow pain and anger it all fades

except love love is forever and there after even when weve fallen to our graves

the most difficult aspect of moving on is accepting that the other person already did

they dont fit you v asked his roommate

not the point no offense but these are wicked village people butch held his heavy arms out and turned in a circle his bare chest catching the light i mean come on

theyre for fighting not fashion

so are kilts but you dont see me rocking the tartan

and thank god for that youre too bowlegged to pull that shit off

butch assumed a bored expression you can bite me

the tune was sad as the best of ireland was melancholy and lovely as a lovers tears

what every girl dreams of when shes dumped is  that the guy will someday feel regrest and come back and tell her all about it and the beauty of it is you have no regrets whatsoever

the entire time im burning in hell ill regret each tear i made you weep but if hell were the price for twenty days with you id condemn myself again and again

this is going to sound crazy but from the moment i first set eyes on you i havent been able to stop thinking about you

she gave a little gasp if you love me all so much why are you still dressed she whispered you know nothing jon snow nothoh oh ohhh

afterward she was almost shy or as shy as ygritte ever got the thing you did she said when they lay together on their piled clothes with yourmouth she hesistated is thatis it what lordss do to their ladies down in the south

i dont think so no one had ever told jon just what lords did with their ladies i onlywanted to kiss you there thats all you seemed to like it

aye ii liked it some no one taught you such

theres been no one he confessed only you

once she kissed me my heart slowed and every muscle in my body relaxed how much i needed her terrified me pg arc

how come when mortals want things their only option is to make a deal with hell and sell their soul why can’t they make deals with god in exchange for good behavior

then who are they making them with i exclaimed

themselves

he shook his head staring at her like a condemned man who beheld the face of his executioner aline he whispered do you know what hell is

yes her eyes overflowed trying to exist with your heart living somewhere outside your body

no its knowing that you have so little faith in my love you would have condemned me to a lifetime of agony his face contorted suddenly to something worse than death

she wanted to go over and hug his tears away but she was too frightened

what she demanded

he shrugged a man’s got to keep up appearances i’ll be universally detested if everyone realizes how perfect you are

you think id cheat on you i demanded with all the innocent outrage i could muster

with another guy no with a cheeseburger    in a heartbeat

mock me all you like whatever i imagined then now it is i who would beg and grovel for a kind word from your lips his eyes are black with desire by you i am forever undone

shell be back ranger said but not tonight

stephanie howd you get her to leave

told her i was gonna spend the next twelve hours ruining you for all other men and so she might as well go home

i could feel the heat rush to my face

ranger gave me the wolf smile i lied about it being tonight he said

what dyou suppose i care if im a gentleman or not if i were a gentleman i shouldnt waste my time with a vulgar slut like you

im afraid theyre in love he said concerned they dont want to leave you he lifted one hand from her waist to gently brush a pair from her neck where their wings fanned against her jaw melancholy he said i know just how they feel

i feel as though i am ice and he is fire

we are so completely different yet the

same

smiling i cut across the quadrangle toward the commons i felt better about life than i had in a very long time we could do this lissa and me we could do this together

you are enough to drive a saint to madness or a king to his knees

i’m writing this because you begged you know how i love the begging

because we all need to believe in movies sometimes

we’re never gonna understand women they’re way too complex you’ve got too many variables to consider pms bad hair days miscellaneous mood swings    there’s no way to tell what’s causing their attitude

what business had i to think of one that never thought of me

were out of time payton you said it yourself the only way well make it is for us to go into this together i know we can do this but i need you to believe it you need to believe in us

peyton didnt say anything for a long moment and jd could literally hear his heart beating then she finally answered

it would have to be called kendall and jameson

it took jd a moment to catch on then he grinned no way jameson and kendall its alphabetical

you told our boss that you banged me on top of your desk

kendall and jameson sounds great

maybe he thinks he can rescue me no one is that stupid

it’s a blessed thing to love and feel loved in return

once upon a time there was a silence that dreamed of becoming a song and then i found you and now everything is music

she puts her hands on either side of my face and the room falls away i have never gotten so lost in a kiss before

and then the space between us explodes my heart keeps missing beats and my hands cannot bring her close enough to me i taste her and realize i have been starving

i have loved before but it didnt feel like this

i have kissed before but it didnt burn me alive

maybe it lasts a minute and maybe its an hour all i know is that kiss and how soft her skin is when it brushes against mine and that even if i did not know it until now i have been waiting for this person forever

wow said adrian he sat down on the bed and tested its bounciness giving it a nod of approval this is amazing what do you think buttercup

i have no words i said honestly

he patted the spot beside him want to try it out

hey cass id say hand me that toothpaste

caitlin shed say her voice dark and serious i cant hand you the toothpaste but i can help you hand the toothpaste to yourself

his heart had been right there was only one

to see the years touch ye gives me joy he whispered for it means that ye live

it doesn’t matter where i am i’m yours

mercy is for the weak… let me show you how much of an unseelie i still am

apparently dancing for him and throwing herself at him werent enough apparently she had to nearly commit murder to arouse him enough to attack her

eve what is it about asking you catholic questions that gets you all jumpy

roarke youd be jumpy too if i asked you things that make you feel the hot breath of hell at your back

eve youre not going to hell

roarke oh and have you got some inside intel on that

eve you married a copyou married me im your goddamn salvation

the decision to kiss for the first time is the most crucial in any love story it changes the relationship of two people much more strongly than even the final surrender because this kiss already has within it that surrender

my life before him was so simple and decided now after himits justafter

ill never recover if he breaks my heart brooke

doesnt it scare you sometimes how time flies and nothing changes

we kiss again this next kiss is the kind that breaks open the sky it steals my breath and gives it back it shows me that every other kiss ive had in my life has been wrong

i would know you anywhere for my true love whoever i was and whoever you were i would know you at once for my true love

vane grabbed me dulac let’s chat

chat britishspeak for stand still while i yell at you

my love is something valuable to me which i ought not to throw away without reflection

dont answer the door in a wedding dress and veil he might not think youre joking

sometimes letting go is the only way to find out who youre meant to hold on to

hmm…now that i think about it housecats are often coddled and petted you don’t pet me nearly enough you must be a lax owner how selfish of you to deprive your cat of attention

she nodded grabbed her purse out of the drawer and skedaddled walking like she was on a catwalk one foot in front of the other her ass swaying under the skirt of her expensive tailored suit

bitch i thought again watching her go

no comparison luke said after the door closed behind dawn and i turned to him

dawn’s a man eater you’re not no comparison luke answered and i didn’t know how to take that

is that good

the halfsmile came back

most men prefer to do the eating

to fall in love with someones thoughts  the most intimate splendid romance

he had a way of taking your hand which made it clear hed have to be the one to let go

i had fallen too far i was in love with rush finlay

you are only alive now because you said to the pain i want that phrase explained

and then my right eye and then my ears and shall we get on with it the prince said

the sword crashed to the floor

most dont deserve your tears and the ones that do will never make you cry

any time not spent on love is wasted

unrequited love is so boring weeping under a blueblack sky is for suckers or maniacs

if you also thinks it means i wake up every morning wondering what i did to deserve having you back in my life well youd be right about that too

but this girlshe doesn’t feel pointless she’s real and she’s beautiful and she fits perfectly when she’s in my arms she makes me want to feel

a broken heart is just the growing pains necessary so that you can love more completely when the real thing comes along

and just then damon stepped out of the coat closet and at the same time aunt maggie tripped him neatly and said bathroom door beside you and picked up a vase and hit the rising damon over the head with it hard

growing up and seeing your parents flaws is like losing your religion i dont believe in god anymore i dont believe in my father either

let go he advised me and i loosened my grip on his hands no not of me he said smiling you can hold on to me as long as you want let go of the pain sookie let go you need to drift away

it was the first time i had relinquished my will to someone else as i looked at him it became easy and i retreated from the suffering and uncertainty of this strange place

rogerson i asked him sweetly as we sat watching a video in the pool house where would i find the pelagic zone

in the open sea he said now shut up and eat your junior mints

i will bathe in your warmth ma petite roll you around me until my heart beats only for you my breath will grow warm from your kiss

delusion detests focus and romance provides the veil

her definition of romance was absentminded intimacy the way someone elses hand stray to your plate of food

kittys always saying how origin stories are important

at college when people ask us how we met how will we answer them the short story is we grew up together but thats more joshs and my story high school sweethearts thats peter and gens story so whats ours then

i suppose ill say it all started with a love letter

bonnie believe in me i’ll save you

i remember how to fly

disagreements over money are the biggest cause of divorce

she waved her hand absolutely no problem your money is our money my money is my money she wrote away

i should make you negotiate with phoebe

and they were quiet but their blood and nerves and butterflies were not—they were rampantly alive rushing and thrumming in a wild and perfect melody matched note for note

i could still feel the ghost of him hovering in the quiet dark recess of my heart it was as if he was just waiting for me to be lonely or to let my guard down so that he could surface and fill my mind again with thoughts of him

those freckles make you seem like a galaxy of stars just waiting to be explored and loved

i pulled back laughing are you growling at me

he laughed softly twisted my hair ribbon around his fingers and pulled gently loosening my braid biting my ear lightly he whispered a threat you have been driving me crazy for three weeks youre lucky all im doing is growling

phones are distracting the internet is distractingthe way he looked at you he wasnt distracted he was consumed

a dragon just gave me a piece of jewelry she said she took another swig and handed the bottle back to graydon have i been added to his hoard

he shook his head and drank too no cupcake he said i’m pretty sure you’ve replaced it

it is our wounds that create in us a desire to reach for miracles the fulfillment of such miracles depends on whether we let our wounds pull us down or lift us up towards our dreams

it was the sort of bone deep emotion that made him want to hold her tighter with one hand and draw a sword against the world with the other

you keep runnin that mouth and im goin to take you back there and screw you

grace darius moaned his erection straining against her stomach

continue darius said his arms wound around her so tightly she could barely breathe his skin blazed hot against hers hotter than even the steamy water

are you sure

continue taut lines bracketed his mouth

well the king summoned the dragon meanwhile the physician slipped him the antidote for the itching powder which the dragon put into his mouth and for the next few hours the dragon worked passionately on the queens breasts

anyway she said reaching around him and lathering the muscled mounds of his butt the queens itching was eventually relieved and the dragon left satisfied and touted as a hero

this does not sound like a joke darius said

heart of the dragon

was it the infinite sadness of her eyes that drew him or the mirror of himself that he found in the gorgeous clarity of her mind

though sorrow may impede my heart

it is of great love to have known you

why be alone when we can be together baby

you can make my life worthwhile

and i can make you start to smile

i closed my mouth and looked across the water inches away denna did the same i could feel the heat of her she smelled like road dust and honey and the smell the air holds seconds before a heavy summer rain

neither of us spoke i closed my eyes the closeness of her was the sweetest sharpest thing i had ever known

giving generously in romantic relationships and in all other bonds means recognizing when the other person needs our attention attention is an important resource

roarke the bodies of the three men were found floating in the chattahoochee river

eve i think itd be embarrassing to be dead in the hoochiecoochie river

eve whats the difference

roarke quite a bit id think

by you i am forever undone

you are he says the absolute worst idea ive ever had

take care if you do not speak – i shall claim you as my own in some strange presumptuous way send me away at once if i must go – margaret –

all right then she snapped do as you please perhaps afterward we could manage a coherent discussion twisting beneath him she flopped onto her stomach

christopher went still after a long hesitation she heard him ask in a far more normal voice what are you doing

i’m making it easier for you came her defiant reply go on start ravishing

another silence then why are you facing downward

because that’s how it’s done beatrix twisted to look at him over her shoulder a twinge of uncertainty caused her to ask isn’t it

his face was blank has no one ever told you

no but i’ve read about it

christopher rolled off her relieving her of his weight he wore an odd expression as he asked from what books

veterinary manuals and of course i’ve observed the squirrels in springtime and farm animals and

she was interrupted as christopher cleared his throat loudly and again darting a confused glance at him she realized that he was trying to choke back amusement

beatrix began to feel indignant her first time in a bed with a man and he was laughing

look here she said in a businesslike manner i’ve read about the mating habits of over two dozen species and with the exception of snails whose genitalia is on their necks they all— she broke off and frowned why are you laughing at me

christopher had collapsed overcome with hilarity as he lifted his head and saw her affronted expression he struggled manfully with another outburst beatrix i’m    i’m not laughing at you

you are

no i’m not it’s just    he swiped a tear from the corner of his eye and a few more chuckles escaped squirrels

well it may be humorous to you but it’s a very serious matter to the squirrels

among my stillness was a pounding heart

sensuality often hastens the growth of love so much that the roots remain weak and are easily torn up

i dont have a lot of domestic instincts ranger said to me his attention fixing on the unidentifiable glob in my hair but i have a real strong urge to take you home and hose you down

i went dry mouth connie bit into her lower lip and lula fanned herself with a file

welcome to paris anna im glad youve come

he understood how dangerous oaths could be but leo didnt care

im coming back for you calypso he said to the night wind i swear it on the river styx

and blood and tears and screams did not matter anymore because at least they are together

and meredith and bonnie whos going to bend some spoons for us next im going to throw you down a rope… that is unless bonnie can levitate you out

sometimes i used to think that one day i should wake up and all that had been would be over forgotten sunk drowned nothing was sure  not even memory

he didn’t save me though he allowed me the freedom to save myself which is the very best type of rescue

it’s like this…a starving man would gladly eat a radish right in fact a radish would be a feast if that’s all he had but if he had a buffet in front of him the radish would never be chosen

it feels incredible to be outside when i’m supposed to be inside the sensation of freedom is intoxicating

run juliette run faster run until your bones break and your shins split and your muscles atrophy and your heart dies because it was always too big for your chest and it beat too fast for too long and you run

run run run until you cant hear their feet behind you run until they drop their fists and their shouts dissolve in the air run with your eyes open and your mouth shut and dam the river rushing up behind your eyes run juliette

run until you drop dead make sure your heart stops before they ever reach you before they ever touch you

id run my whole life long to reach you paddle my way across atlantic and pacific traverse jungle and desert to find you climb cliffs and drop from the sky to rescue you anything to be close to you any way to say i love you

nozy cat lifted one sleepy eyelid and his marble blue eye glared at her for interrupting his sacred nap he wore a yellow collar with little red stars printed on it his second eyelid also opened and he gave them his irritated blueeyed glare

the world takes us to a silver screen on which flickering images of passion and romance play and as we watch the world says this is love god takes us to the foot of a tree on which a naked and bloodied man hangs and says this is love

maybe okay will be our always

not so much two ships passing in the night as two ships sailing together for a time but always bound for different ports

she threw up her hands all right why not

why not

his arms fell to his sides thats it i pour my heart out i love you so much ive got freakin tears in my eyes and all i get in return is why not

what did you expect am i supposed to fall all over you just because youve finally come to your senses

would it be too much to askhed begun to glare at her again his eyes growing stormier by the minutewhen do you think you might be ready to fall all over me that is

i want to be with you forever and beyond

if you loved someone you couldn’t let lies come between you no matter what happened—even if you’d already lost each other forever—you owed each other the truth

a woman with romance in her life lived as grandly as a queen because her heart was treasured

i have nothing to give but my heart so full and these empty hands

theyre not empty now

i wanted someone to love

in any relationship in which two people become one the end result is two half people

cagney sighed listened to the leather creak as he shifted his weight in his chair

people get stupid when theyre in love people want what they cant have and the years between ages twelve and eighteen always always suck

after their encounter on the approach to jupiter there would aways be a secret bond between themnot of love but of tenderness which is often more enduring

his yellow eyes gazed at me possessively  i wondered if he realized that the way he looked at me was far more intimate than copping a feel could ever be

ivy i stammered then glared at kisten you told ivy thanks a hell of a lot want to call my mom next

babe ranger said youre looking a little strung out is there anything i should know

my mouth dropped open and i think some drool might have dribbled out

no matter what happened he was dex and i was perry and that combination only led to trouble

how do you we you know faeries pollinate

the male produces pollen on his hands and when two faeries decide to pollinate the male reaches into the females blossom and lets the pollen mix its a somewhat delicate process

doesnt sound very romantic

theres nothing romantic about it at all tamani replied a confident smile spreading across his face thats what sex is for

you still she let the question hang

but faeries dont get pregnant

never tamani winked pollination is for reproduction sex is just for fun

laurel and tamani

i am a wild woman

it would take a warrior to tame my spirit

hermione was screaming again the sound went through harry like physical pain

see mirror every time you will miss me and look deeper into your eyes till you will find me

over everything i choose you

living is harddying is easy you close your eyes and never open them again whats so difficult about that nothing reallyexcept it hurts like hell to those you leave behind

possess have hold enjoy control dominate pick your verb ms fairchild i intend to explore so very many of them

this is love i think a place where people who have been alone may lock together like hawks and spin in the air dizzy with surprise at the connection a place you go willingly and with wonder

the truth is i do love you admitting that means opening myself up to all that pain when you leave after you realize this wasn’t love but gratitude

i hate seeing poetry in everything i touch i hate that i can no longer love you without turning you into a metaphor  that it can never be simple as looking at you and saying yes yes yes

what do you believe in

i believe in  finding out

life is a book waiting to happen

under your window in the quite snow

let me stand here and shiver i’ll be stronger

if i can see your light before i go

all through the weeks i’ve tried to keep my balance

leaves fell then rain then shadows i fell too

easy restraint is not among my talents

fall turned to winter and i came to you

kissed by the snow i contemplate your face

oh do not hide it in your pillow yet

warm rooms would never lure me from this place

if only i could see your silhouette

turn on your light my sun my summer love

zero degrees down here july above

dreams only come true if you

point yourself in their direction

ian saw the tears shimmering in her magnificent eyes and one of them traced unheeded down her smooth cheek

hearts cant be broken because theyre made of marzipan

it is when things are at worst you will get the best

never ask a question if you don’t know the answer

she as no other ever could reached every corner of his heart his joy and his salvation

you told me i was the best sex youd ever had in your lifeyou couldnt get enoughat one point you were so loud i thought sure hotel security was going to beat down the door

humans are vulnerable because they’re capable of being hurt

anthony looked down at his evil clutches  hands he reminded himself hands  and grinned anew

my dearest girl said the vampire finally examining lord maccon with an exhausted but appreciative eye such a banquet never been one to favor werewolves myself but he is very well equipped now is he not

there are plastic bags with zippers on them ive seen them in commercials dragos said to her he snapped his fingers trying to remember the name you put food in them

ziploc bags she asked in a cautious voice

he pointed at her yes i want one

i didn’t know what to call it what was happening between us but i liked it it felt silly and fragile and good

i am yours he whispered i live to hold you risa i breathe to touch you

my heart cracked daemon never begged

eyes look your last

arms take your last embrace

and lips oh you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death

this first glance of a soul which does not yet know itself is like dawn in the heavens it is the awakening of something radiant and unknown

closed plenty of time to see it later remember he leads me into the courtyard and i take the opportunity to admire his backside callipygian there is something better than notredame

beauty is subjective you know how sometimes what makes a person attractive is the way they make you laugh or how it seems like they can read your mind

romance is the deepest thing in life it is deeper than reality

oh dear she let her head fall back to the pillow there it went ive fallen in love with you now

just now chuckling he came to a sitting position resting his forearm on one bent knee well thank god for belated blessings he ran a hand

through his hair its been coming on rather longer than that for me

what she sat bolt upright what can you mean since when

from the first amelia from the very first

a really manly man with a lot of mannishness in his manliness

by the time bones announced it was tammys turn id fallen in love with him all over again flowers and jewelry worked for most girls as a romantic gesture but here i was mistyeyed at watching him show my mother how to stab the shit out of him

i spent most of my youth hauling sides of beef and pork to my fathers shop carrying you is far more enjoyable

how sweet annabelle mumbled sickly her eyes closed every woman dreams of being told that shes preferable to a dead cow

you stole my loneliness i may have given you wings but youve become my gravity ill never be free of your force

when did you feel your

most euphoric kiss

was i the source

of your greatest bliss

they dont know the truth behind the name

my angel

my only

its like you have a plan and someone comes along and makes you want to change it all but you still like your first plan no matter how fantastic the second one makes you feel

there was a large sting near his upper lip i touched it lightly does it hurt

my gaze moved from his lips up to his eyes he was looking at me in a way that made me blush

yes he responded quietly

look at me we aren´t them lauren you´re not your mother or father any more than i´m my mother you´re you and i´m me and i love you

his arms wrapped around me and he pressed his forehead to my shoulder his body shaking i stroked a hand through his silken hair

rhys looked up his face gleaming with tears he went still as i leaned in kissing away one tear then the other as he had once kissed away mine

when my lips were wet and salty with them i pulled back far enough to see his eyes you’re mine i breathed

tereza knew what happens during the moment love is born the woman cannot resist the voice calling forth her terrified soul the man cannot resist the woman whose soul thus responds to his voice

join us next time for days of the undead when rachel learns her long lost brother is really a crown prince from outer space

she had not made a decision to give up sex only the clamor of romance because it was exhausting her doing her no good and too much harm

i smiled sweetly at his embarressment beginning to walk again kicking up golden leaves i heard him scuffling leaves behind me and what was the point of this again

forget it sam said do you you like this place or not

i stoped in my tracks spinning to face him hey i pointed at him he raised his eyebrows and stopped in his tracks you didnt think jack would be here at all did you

his thick black eyebrows went up even farther

did you evan intend to look for him at all

he held his hands up as if a surrender what do you want me to say

so you brought me here to see this i stepped forward again and he stepped back

do you like it

under false pretence anouther step forward anouther back the grine widened

so do you like it

when you knew we wouldnt come across anybody else

his teeth flashed in his grin do you like it

sam slowly lowered my wrists and relesed them im glad he said very quietly

my arms still hung by my sides right where sam had put them i frowned at him you were supposed to kiss me

i thought about it

i just kept looking at the soft sad shape of his lips looking just like his voice sounded i was probably staring but i couldnt stop thinking about how much i wanted him to kiss me and how stupide it was to want it so badly why dont you

he leaned over and gave mr the lightest of kisses his lips cool and dry ever so polite and incredibly maddening i have to get inside soon he whispered its getting cold

existence after losing her would be hell

to me you are magic

love is  fill in the blank yourself

and empty words are evil

i dont need handcuffs to enslave a woman ranger to stephanie

the man is always the last to know when

cupid has struck him

your mother won a special reward she told me because everyone had a head in her pictures we all applauded

when you choose a man who thinks eight seconds is a long time perhaps you need two of them hmm

you’re my best friend

you’re my love

i can’t wait to

make you

carolyn chase former broadcast journalist and heroine kate theodores mother

girls their mother interjected you must both stop being strange  it is unattractive and dont forget your hats it would be absolutely the end for me if you two came down with freckles at a time like this

you know that weve got a few problems we need to talk through before we get married

im not getting rid of pooh

see there you go being antagonistic marriage means learning to compromise

i didnt say i wouldnt compromise i promise to take the ribbon out of her topknot before you walk her

vane’s lips tightened to suppress a smile why so hostile love

you whacked me on the head with a ball

you deserved it

hurricanes couldn’t remove you from my mind you’re my world and i’m incapable of not loving you

i have you with me and im terrified youll disappear

ranger locked eyes with me please he said

tank and hal were goggleeyed they werent used to please i wasnt used to it either but i liked it

okay i said be careful hes insane

by the way you dont need the makeup puck said

i had liked him for all the wrong reasons

she leaned into me and when i closed my eyes i knew i wanted nothing more than to hold her this way forever

she was a ray of sunshine a warm summer rain a bright fire on a cold winter’s day and now she could be dead because she had tried to save the man she loved

laugh as much as you breathe and love as long as you live

i die but when the grave shall press

the heart so long endeared to thee

when earthy cares no more distress

and earthy joys are nought to me

weep not but think that i have past

before thee oer the sea of gloom

have anchored safe and rest at last

where tears and mouring can not come

tis i should weep to leave thee here

on that dark ocean sailing drear

with storms around and fears before

and no kind light to point the shore

but long or short though life may be

tis nothing to eternity

we part below to meet on high

i liked you the first time i saw you you were sitting on the floor surrounded by books and you looked up when i opened the door and smiled right at me it felt like you had been waiting for me like you were welcoming me home

he murmured her name tenderly taking her face in his hands i love you he said his voice low and fervent i love you with everything i am everything i’ve been and everything i hope to be

and if you say thats because you lot barged into her home like a herd of mentally deficient sheep im disowning all three of you

everything about andrew was hot from the hands holding him down to the mouth steadily taking neil apart neil finally understood why his mother thought this was so dangerous

there was nothing sweet or gentle in our last kiss it was filled with sorrow and desperation of the bitter knowledge that we couldve had something perfect but it just wasnt meant to be

who ends up with their first real boyfriend yeah no one

roarke youd enjoy flying more if youd learn the controls

eve id rather pretend im on the ground

roarke and how many vehicles have you wrecked had blown up or destroyed in the last oh two years

eve think about that then imagine it happening when im at the wheel at thirty thousand feet

roarke good point ill do the flying

not really hungry

she’ll eat pritkin said curtly

if you starve to death it would damage my professional reputation

the same does not apply should i strangle you in understandable irritation however

i’ll have a sandwich i told nick no meat

patience is a virtue and the best things in life are worth waiting for

what were you thinking i demanded once we were moving to the music i was trying to ignore his hands do you know how much trouble you may have gotten me in

adrian grinned nah they all feel bad for you youll achieve martyrdom after dancing with a mean wicked vampire job security with the alchemists

if not for me being stoned and clinging to a taco it would have been terribly romantic

here’s what i know death abducts the dying but grief steals from those left behind

i was afraid of getting hurt in other ways to be truthful i still am

his thumb stroked her cheek i would never hurt you

i dont think you can promise me that she squeezed his bruised fingers but it makes things a bit more equal to know that i can hurt you too

his gaze fell to her lips he said simply without any trace of irony you are killing me

you cant blame these kids for not being thankful or satisfied with what they have their mentality eludes them from the reality

but ill have to ask you to wait a long time anne said gilbert sadly it will be three years before ill finish my medical course and even then there will be no diamond sunbursts and marble halls

that’s the really annoying thing about love i probably would be happier if i didn’t know it but once you do know it once you feel those things for someone you can’t make yourself really wish it away it’s like wishing away    your soul

you sleep okay sweetie

miss my teddy billie replied

personally i thought detective mitch lawson was far superior to a tiny pink teddy bear but i wasn’t six years old

our universe grants every soul a twin

a reflection of themselves the kindred spirit  and no matter where they are or how far away they are from each other even if they are in different dimensions they will always find one another this is destiny this is love

i caught his hand what do you want me to do

leaning down he kissed the pulse beating on my neck just above the damaged skin tomorrow i need you to die

come to think of it she did not speak a word yet i could have sworn she had the most beautiful voice

do you really expect me to fall apart every time another woman throws herself at you because if thats so ill be a nervous wreck before the honeymoons over although if they do it in front of me

he went still did you just propose to me

she bristled do you have a problem with that

the scoreboard lit up and he gave the world a high five god i love you

i slipped in and out of consciousness as time stretched and flowed around me dreams and reality blurred but i liked the dreams better noah was in them

i dreamed of us walking hand in hand down a crowded street in the middle of the day we were in new york i was in no rush—i could walk with him forever—but noah was he pulled me alongside him strong and determined and not smiling not today

we wove among the people somehow not touching a single one the trees were green and blossoming it was spring almost summer a strong wind shook a few steadfast flowers off of the branches and into our path we ignored them

they funneled into a throbbing mass as we strode up a hill over and through until we could see them all below us angry and electric noah reached into his bag he pulled out the little cloth doll my grandmother’s the one we burned

looks like kelsey wins the award for early riser and doesn’t she look purtier than a pat of butter meltin’ all over a stack of griddle cakes

like a shot from a movie the morning sun shone brilliantly around him like a god—his dark hair glinted warmly in the light and his eyes gleamed bluer than the south pacific ocean

taylors mind went blank and suddenly she couldnt remember why the hell she ever had been angry with jason andrews

but then he spoke

sleeping in this morning ms donovan he drawled

i love you katherine james i love you with everything i am youre the best thing that has ever happened to me remember that

i love you breathlessly my amazing man

youre my sister he said finally my sister my blood my family i should want to protect you—he laughed soundlessly without any humor—to protect you from the sort of boys who want to do with you exactly what i want to do

clarys breath caught you said you just wanted to be my brother from now on

but aline—

clarys voice had sunk to a whisper i dont want anyone but you either

but do we know how to make love stay

i cant even think about it the best i can do is play it day by day

how poor are they that have no patients what wound did ever heal but by degrees

shakespeare isnt going to save you this time superman your times run out

he scowled perhaps i should have been studying the taming of the shrew

you know she said dreamily passing over his question you’re not nearly as handsome as lord stvincent

there’s a surprise he said dryly

strider keeper of the demon of defeat

falling in love is not a rational process it cant be planned or avoided it happensfor good or bad it simply happens  katrina svensen

i dont want just a night or a week or a month with you i want you all the time i like you better than calculus and math is the only thing that unites the universe

and to see the white flash of klauss eyes as he whirled on her for one stunned instant she stared at him and then lightning crackled

from an empty sky

live princess for me i love you

my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasion for teasing and quarreling with you as often as may be

i had a dream about you last night i was alone on a dark night and you came to me as a firefly i knew it was you because you were the brightest

i tell you dain is a splendid catch i advise you to set your hooks and reel him in

jessica took a long swallow of her cognac this is not a trout genevieve this is a great hungry shark

torie doesn’t count you were obviously her mother in a previous life

ranger hows your mental health he asked i heard about soder

stephanie im rattled

he put the truck in gear and headed for the exit i know what youre thinking he said and that wasnt where i was going i was going to suggest work

i knew that

he looked over at me and grinned you want me bad

i did god help me

so beav tell me about yourself

im blue

sweetheart if i had your dubious taste in men i wouldnt be too happy either

my name is blue blue bailey

in the beginning being alone is always a choice then its not a choice anymore when did it stop being a choice what is it in me that stopped choosing you that moved into you instead so that i have to be with you in order to be with myself

if you get yourself killed ill find your grave and spit on it she threatened

hades was the personification of dark and dangerousa living breathing batman

i invited a few people to help celebrate your birthday cameron said sheepishly she threw up her hands surprise

we sort of come with the package collin explained think of it as a collective gift from all of us to you five bona fide annoying and overly intrusive new best friends

its the gift that keeps on giving wilkins said

jack grinned im touched really and since it appears im going to be moving in let me be the first to say that all of you are always welcome at my and camerons house subject to a minimum of fortyeight hours prior notification

because being with you makes perfect sense

she turned to look at him and he was already looking at her i’m going to miss you when i wake up she whispered because she realized that she must have fallen asleep under the sun arin was too real for her imagination he was a dream

don’t wake up he said

and it is you spiritwith will and energy and virtue and puritythat i want not alone with your brittle frame

i love you

i stared stupidly at him was he joking again reciting another line from my story i didn’t remember writing this

he leaned in and kissed me i didn’t respond for a few seconds my mind lagged behind what my body was feeling

say it he whispered against my lips i know this is hard for you tell me

i love you hearing my own words i gasped at the rush of emotion

he put his hands on either side of my jaw and took my mouth with his

nothing good ever comes of love what comes of love is always something better

i dont want to be in love but youre makin me

born to be wild born to be free nobody owns you you are a romantic tree

no need no need life is already too short to find it

im a terrible prince i should put my kingdom first and everything else second but your first i want you by my side every second but i know i would crumble if i lost you

if i gave you a pity position it wouldnt be in my office

he smiled i suppose i thought wed have a madly impractical terrifyingly modern sort of marriage one based on love not to mention dangerous undertakings and hairsbreadth escapes from burning buildings high ledges and exploding sewers

and bickering

always that yes

assuming i want to marry at all

true i know of no good way of forcing you to do anything

and youre mad enough to think it could work  one day

he cupped her face in his hands his smile was so brilliant it seemed to illuminate the room i think it would be heaven

she trembled then you have a very strange idea of heaven

kiss me and see

this time the fluttery feeling in my stomach was more intense it made the inside of my thighs tingle and my breathing deepen

you cold or something he said she strained against him she wanted to pass clear through him its a chill its nothing and then pushing a little away say you love me

i said it

no oh no you havent i was listening and you never do

he sat up and glanced at a clock across the room it was after five then decisively he pulled off his windbreaker and began to unlace his shoes

arent you going to clyde

he grinned back at her yeah im going to

i dont mean that and whats more i dont like it you sound as though you were talking to a whore

come off it honey you didnt drag me up here to tell you about love

you disgust me she said

listen to her shes sore

hello little one did you know youre on private property

really i had no idea meryn fudged

he raised an eyebrow the ten foot fence right behind you didnt give it away

sydney dont leave adrian because of me

its more complicated than that i said automatically

its really not she said from everything ive seen and heard youre just afraid youve always controlled every detail of your life when you couldntlike with the alchemistsyou found a way to seize back that control

there is nothing wrong with wanting control i snapped

he wanted to be a poet someone else put in while maggie hugged tim and patted his back said hed only lacked the words to be one

sometimes limbs must be rebroken to set properly her heart too needed to shatter anew before it could truly heal

there was a time when our desire for each other would have landed us in an asylum or prison had it not been sanctioned by mutual assent true or false

the night world isnt a place its all around us the creatures of night world are beautiful and deadly and irresitable to humans your best friend could be oneso could your crush

it all comes down to who is by your side and who is willing to stand up for love even when it seems impossible

women tend to love men in their presence while men tend to love women in their absence

cam and i just broke up

cam laughed hugging me even tighter into his side

i huffed trying to wriggle free what are you doing

getting back together with you

some people like the jews and some do not but no thoughtful man can deny the fact that they are beyond any question the most formidable and most remarkable race which has appeared in the world

— winston s churchill

more than anything rob persisted youd crawl on your belly over broken glass for her easy

we could go back to your house i can stay with you always we can know each others bodies in every way night after night i could love you i could work you would not be poor i would help you

she answered with a passion i didn’t expect  i was lost in that moment our hearts beat as one in that moment i knew she loved me ren

i wrapped the unyielding woman i loved in my arms  kissed her slowly hoping that some part of her would sense my absolute devotion ren

she’d fallen into a deep silence once when the sun appeared and it was then he’d wondered most what she was thinking

i dont deserve you im not made for relationships i know im going to fuck this up im going to drive you away or do something to hurt you and youll be added to my list of people i screwed over you should walk away now

thrilled with the knowledge that she loved me it took me a moment to realize that she was angry i found her tantrum irresistible ren

never let a boy know you’re crazy about him he’ll lose interest and then you’ll be a loser

so we forgive each other the crooked smile climbs up one more time again

and i look right into his eyes right into him as far as i can see because i want him to hear me i want him to hear me with everything i mean and feel and say

always i say to him every time

felicity mrs featherington interurupted why dont you tell mr brdgerton about your watercolors

for the life of him colin couldnt imagine a less interesting topic except maybe for phillipas watercolors but he nonetheless turned to the youngest featherington with a friendly smile and asked and how are your watercolors

but felicity bless her heart gave him a rather friendly smile herself and said nothing but i imagine theyre fine thank you

a woman could be as beautiful as she felt herself to be

we were hooked when we woke

we had arms for each other

but i yearned to resume

my dreams of another

i knew you would do me good in some way at some timei saw it in your eyes when i first beheld you

hey i said indignation filling me i’m immortal doesn’t that mean i won’t get saggy boobs and gray hair because if it doesn’t mean that i want a refund—

our hearts are bound together he said and i am free to decide who i love and what i want nothing  not the pressure of my family or what anyone else thinks  matters

please forgive me one more chance blaire i want this i want you

great id been dumped in hells waiting room

you look like the vamp who bled the cat

when im with you bells go off in my head like a moving truck thats backing up

no more no less im an idiot i really need to let this crush go

now said brandons low cold voice lets not be rude eve

he smiled how kind of you to confirm what i already know perhaps next you will introduce me to myself i hear i am quite popular

blake took her face in his hands you let me touch you kiss you your skin it feels like piano keys my hands know just where to go

the saddest line you scraped in your diary was not that you cried but those moments when we both shared smile

kyra fred caught kyras eyes im not in love with ariana and i dont want half the kingdom

you dont

he shook his head but i might stick around for a little while longer there are some interesting things in the kingdom of mohr

like what

like a certain funny and extremely talented potioner

kyra took a breath i have to warn you hal isnt that great as a boyfriend hes pretty self absorbed

he held up the ak the muscles in his arm bunching against the weight this is an assault rifle then held up the handgun this is a semiautomatic pistol

then he gave a little thrust of his hips and looked down at his penis that is my gun as you’ve discovered it’s pumpaction like a shotgun  but it doesn’t fire bullets

what really happened doesnt matter what matters is how we agree to remember it

everybody is equally weak on the inside just that some present their ruins as new castles and become kings –

jessica you are a pain in the arse do you know that if i were not so immensely fond of you i should throw you out the window

she wrapped her arms about his waist and laid her head against his chest not merely fond but immensely fond oh dain i do believe i shall swoon

not now he said crossly i havent time to pick you up

i’m sorry the message said

the theft was a violation of privacy it was an unbelievable act of impudence and disrespect not only that it was—baffling he was murderous incandescent with fury he was older than sin and could not remember when he had last been in such a rage

he looked at the paper again

i’m sorry i had to take your penny here’s another to replace it

yep that’s what it said

one corner of his mouth twitched he gave himself a deep shock when he burst into an explosive guffaw

she was not sorry and if it was the wine telling her that then she would tell the wine the same thing tomorrow she was not sorry

a romantic man often feels more uplifted with two women than with one his love seems to hit the ideal mark somewhere between two different faces

together in that room our childhood notions of love melted away we discovered love was not a fairytale sometimes there were no happy endings and when there were you needed to work like hell to keep the happiness alive

i want to kiss you again tess

why

he chuckled low under his breath why because you’re beautiful and because i want you and i think you want me too

who are you i asked

you know who i am he replied im yours

you’d start a produce export business and organize a local economy within a month she said flatly

harry groaned as he recognized the truth of it god why do you tolerate me

poppy grinned and slid her arms around his neck i like the side benefits she told him and really it’s only fair since you tolerate me

i don’t want to be a widow i don’t want michael bayning and i don’t want you to joke about such things you tactless clodpole

as all three of them stared at her openmouthed poppy leapt up and stalked away her hands drawn into fists

bewildered by the immediate force of her fury—it was like being stung by a butterfly—harry stared after her dumbly after a moment he asked the first coherent thought that came to him did she just say she doesn’t want bayning

yes win said a smile hovering on her lips that’s what she said go after her harry

every cell in harry’s body longed to comply except that he had the feeling of standing on the edge of a cliff with one illchosen word likely to send him over he gave poppy’s sister a desperate glance what should i say

be honest with her about your feelings win suggested

a frown settled on harry’s face as he considered that what’s my second option

i don’t understand how i could have believed you were a warm affectionate and tenderhearted person you’re obviously as prickly as a porcupine and any man who comes close to you will end up with a face full of quills

i kiss him to get him to stop talking if he keeps talking i will love him and i dont want to love him i really dont as strategies go its not my finest kissing is just another way of talking except without the words

marriage is a partnership not a democracy

for you my love i would endeavor to pluck the stars from the sky only to shower them at your feet

how do you do that’

do what

say things like that that’s beautiful

i’ve spent years studying poetry mrs emerson it’s in my dna

if you were mine id never leave you prudence i couldnt

if she had learned anything in the past weeks it was that there was enough to be ashamed of in the course of a messy human life without being ashamed of loving someone

you can’t go back can’t fix what broke but you can go forward and every step matters every one makes a difference she pushed away from the desk cupped his face in her hands from where i’m standing you’re the best step i ever took

theres only one of him she thought and hes right here

he knows ill like a song before ive heard it he laughs before i even get to the punch line theres a place on his chest just below his throat that makes me want to let him open doors for me

theres only one of him

you want me to pin my entire operation the entire revolution on some teenaged love story i cant believe this

his dear face dear to her dearer still how could she love his face more for its damage what kind of person saw someones suffering and felt her heart crack open even wider even more sweetly than before

there was something wrong with her it was wrong to want to touch a scar and call it beautiful

if death is your lover you dont got to be afraid ever that he will ever leave you

it would be easier to forget you he says to me and these past few weeks weve had together it would be easier if i could hate you but the sad truth is i will more than likely love you for the rest of my life

so you actually need spectacles leo finally said

of course i do marks said crossly why would i wear spectacles if i didn’t need them

i thought they might be part of your disguise

my disguise

yes marks disguise a noun describing a means of concealing someone’s identity often used by clowns and spies and now apparently governesses good god can anything be ordinary for my family

she can be a nightmare but this still feels better than any dream

little sister dont you worry about a thing today

take the heat from the sun

i know that everything is not ok

but youre like honey on my tongue

true love never can be rent

but only true love can keep beauty innocent

i could never take a chance

of losing love to find romance

in the mysterious distance

between a man and a woman

no i could never take a chance

the mysterious distance

between a man and a woman

you can run from love

and if its really love it will find you

catch you by the heel

but you cant be numb for love

the only pain is to feel nothing at all

how can i hurt when im holding you

i could never take a chance

of losing love to find romance

in the mysterious distance

between a man and a woman

and youre the one theres noone else

who makes me want to lose myself

in the mysterious distance

between a man and a woman

brown eyed girl across the street

i thought this is the one for me

but she was already mine

you were already mine

ive been sleeping in the street again

ive been trying to feel complete again

but youre gone and so is god

the soul needs beauty for a soul mate

when the soul wantsthe soul waits

no i could never take a chance

of losing love to find romance

in the mysterious distance

between a man and a woman

for love and faith and sex and fear

and all the things that keep us here

in the mysterious distance

between a man and a woman

how can i hurt when im holding you

i told you we were meant to be he says still smiling still so finn who was always here but who i just didnt see and now

well now i kiss him

as bea would say this why they call it fiction

this is what i want this is the only thing ive ever wanted everything else—every single second of every single day that has come before this very moment this kiss—has meant nothing

you know i never believed in fate until i met you then i started thinking coincidence didnt have near so cruel a sense of humor

i’ll affect you slowly

as if you were having a picnic in a dream

there will be no ants

it won’t rain

every broken heart has screamed at one time or another why cant you see who i truly am

the moment i saw her a part of me walked out of my body and wrapped itself around her and there it still remains

he opened his eyes to look at her im the only one youve ever had remember his voice was gruff with affection

i remember she said

no other man is ever going to touch you alesandra youre mine

and jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance which holds the reader fast till the end comes and he finds himself alone in the workaday world again

the fuse is lit you can run all you want to but you leave a trail of gunpowder in your wake there’s going to be a reckoning eventually

you had this all planned didn’t you i accused thought you could come in here and seduce me like you do everyone else it wasn’t as if i could be angry lying atop him as i was but i tried

a handsome prince such as yourself deserves someone who is no less than one hundred percent dedicated to him

it hurt remembering hurt because there was so much id done so much id yet to do in so many different ways i now realized not remembering had been a blessing a brief respite in the twisted bloody mess that my life had become

but at least i knew who i was

it called to him a sweet heady beacon of femininity fertility and fuckability his three favorite fwords

i dodged behind mac for cover and refused to take the bait i glanced at my nonexistent watch oops look at the time guess i have to be going now lets not do this again sometime okay

before i could move pritkin was there jamming the medallion into the skin of my upper armowhe looked at me expectantly i glared at him that hurt

what do you see

because

it is

the only way

i can

reach you

aubrey crouching on a nearby counter watched me with squinty eyes apparently pondering why anyone would willingly immerse themselves in water ever let alone for extended periods of time

i looked at micah who shrugged i looked at rafael who shook his head nice that none of us knew why he was undressing

lets still be friends things that are never true in a break up but you have to say

ive never even been to long island

what is romance but a mutual pact of delusion when the pact ends theres nothing left

but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days

im not the same person i was before and i am deathly afraid i will never be her again

my heart is burning a hole in my chest and every time you speak to me it keeps sinking and im left with nothing but ashes i wish she were talking to me because the more she speaks to me the more my heart flutters like a rising phoenix

karen quan and jarod kintz

when they see us dance when they see how you look at me when they see how i smile at you

it wouldnt have mattered if they were scratches or not he says his voice like liquid i was bitten during the escape from the house my limbs go weak everything inside me folding in collapsing on itself

i was already dead he says opening his eyes

i always have many roads to travel but i take the one which leads to you

in her ear he whispered do better than this shazi my queen is without limitations boundless in all that she does show them

i must be besotted he said evenly i have the imbecilic idea that you’re the prettiest girl i’ve ever seen except for your coiffure he added with a disgusted glance at the coils and plumes and pearls that is ghastly

she scowled your romantic effusions leave me breathless

there are three kinds of people in the world those who dont know and dont know they dont know those who dont know and do know they dont know and those who know and know how much they still dont know

if you die angel it means im already dead

ill never forget the way he tastes its not anything i can describe a little sweet and a whole lot of spice and it feels in that moment absolutely right

with every breath i take i will always love you

at the end of the day your ability to connect with your readers comes down to how you make them feel

yes i make your feet tingle

a smile came to his lips among other things

it taught me that when a woman lets herself love she loses it taught me that to survive you rely on yourself first and last adrianne

it should have also taught you that sometimes love has no threshold philip

love expands your soul with something inexplicably fulfilling if you die without ever having experienced it you will miss lifes only true joy

i keep warning and warning and nobody seems willing to listen one of these days someone is going to wake up to the fact that im serious when i say never to attack my sister without looking over your shoulder for me rhoan

maybe we should go by tube he said

a taxill come she said im in no hurry

so eva stood close to romer in the doorway of the shop on frith street as he shooted and waved at the passing cars moving down the dark street hoping one of them might be a taxi

were out of luck he said turning to find eva standing very close to him her face lifted

im in no hurry she said

he reached for her and kissed her

i love you more than the sun and the stars that i taught﻿ how to shine you are mine and you shine for me too i love you yesterday and today and tomorrow ill say it again i love you more

i still love you i will always love you and that is all that matters i will forgive you anything and i will forgive you this

he looked at the beautiful woman frowning up at him and his cock did nothing his eyes shot back to zoe and damn if his cock didnt twitch happily trevor swallowed hard as realization hit

there was something wrong with his dick

i love these pet names she said gazing soulfully up into his eyes nitwit sap skull termagant how they make my heart flutter

no bikinis on a first date he nods i’m sure that’s a rule or should be for my sisters anyway

how did i get here how did i end up in the arms of a boy i barely knew but knew i didnt want to lose i wondered what i would have thought of andrius in lithuania would i have liked him would he have liked me

someone once told me love isn’t perfect—or predictable

just that i have loved you even when i was nothing and no one to you when you didn’t know my name and barely knew my face

those words that voice had more power over me than any phantom ever could

and if you ever  and i do mean ever  try to leave me i’m goin’ with you

i loved you when you opened like a lily to the heat you see i’m just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet who loved you with his frozen love his second hand physique with all he is and all he was a thousand kisses deep

you matter

i feel like i’m a disappointment to mankind he remarked woefully as he placed the shirt through my arms and began to pull it down over my breasts someone this gorgeous should be on display in a museum

life sure is easier when youre rich

and a natural born charmer dont forget that part

how could i she retorted its the only thing we have in common

tatiana said go on with dasha she is right for you she is a woman and im blind alexander exclaimed tatiana stood desolately failing in the battle of her heart oh alexander what do you want from me

everything he whispered fiercely

he finally lifted his head and murmured against my lips its about bloody time woman

i could recognise his soul in mine as much as he could find me in his our sole existences seemed to have been for this very moment when nothing else mattered

all day and all night my desire for you unwinds like a poisonous snake

love is a wild fire that cannot be contained by any mere element known to man

beatrix do you know what happens to girls who ask such naughty questions

they’re ravished in haylofts she inquired hopefully

i think this’ll definitely tide me over while we’re apartbones laughed dragging me into his arms with far more strength and quickness than was fair considering i still had trouble making my limbs operate

oh kitten he murmured as his lips dragged down my throat you didn’t really think we were done did you

i wished the kiss could have gone on forever breaking the embrace he ran a few fingers through my hair and down my cheek he stepped back toward the door

ill see you later roza

at our next practice i asked we are starting those up again right i mean you still have things to teach me

i guess i like things that take time and attention more worthwhile that way

its b to think of friendship and romance being different theyre not theyre just variations of the same love variatons of the same desire to be close

and we were kissing like drowning people breathe like suddenly wed discovered something that has never been so sweet before that moment

the most temptation id experienced had been with tomas the senates spy who had been feeding off me without permission and mircea who was probably plotting some nefarious scheme i have no taste in men

winter is much like unrequited love cold and merciless

but pearls are for tears the old legend says gilbert had objected

anna he said dragging his frosted fingers through my hairdont you know what it means when a boy pulls your hair at your birthday party no just then i didnt know what anything meant

youre so beautiful i cant believe youre almost mine

its about time its supposed to be a ritual not a marathon

you see yourself as very average ordinary and there is nothing ordinary about you rachel

why i shrieked hitting him again and again and again the sound of the blows thudding against his chest why why why

because i was afraid he got hold of my wrists and threw me backward so i fell across the bed he stood over me fists clenched breathing hard

i am a coward damn you i couldna tell ye for fear ye would leave

me and unmanly thing that i am i thought i couldna bear that

you should have told me

and if i had youd have turned on your heel and gone without a word and having seen ye againi tell ye i would ha done far worse than lie to keep you

just tell him to keep his hands to himself and his python in his pants

he wanted her

and at another time as another man he would have her without hesitation as lover   as more

everything changes except the love

i read the title from the cover  the joy of crap  i read the rest of the full title of the thick nondescript volume to myself and felt myself redden

it’s like he’s picking up parts of the world and showing them to me saying see it’s beautiful

you’re stuck with me

she sniffled promise

he rested his forehead against hers cross my heart

i didnt know what he meant even after he opened his fist to show me the quivering leaves crumpled in his palm

one happy day for every falling leaf you catch sams voice was low

i watched the egdes of the leaves slowly unfold fluttering in the breezehow long did you wait

it would have been romantic if hrd had the courage to look into my face to say it but instead he dropped his eyes to the ground and scuffed his boots in the leaves countless possibilities for happy days on the ground i havent stopped

and i shouldve said something romantic too but i didnt have the courage either so instead i watched the shy way he was chewing his lip and studying the leaves and said that mustve been very borring

grace stopped in the door dimly silhouetted by the dull gray morning light and looked back at me at my eyes my mouth my hands in a way that made something inside me knot and unknot unbearably

i didnt think i belonged here in her world a boy stuck between two lives dragging the dangers of the wolves with me but when she said my name waiting for me to follow i knew id do anything to stay with her

what is real and what is not is for your heart to decide and for your heart to know

remembered the way he tasted the slant of his mouth over hers his scars under her fingers the shape of his body under her hands

hermione turned and beamed at harry her eyes too were full of tears

‘…then i declare you bonded for life

whether he stayed or left whether they walked the same path or not they could live on opposite sides of the world and she would still be his

i raised you so high that every other man on earth is now doomed to live in your shadow

people tend to criticize their spouse most loudly in the area where they themselves have the deepest emotional need

it doesn’t matter i love you that’s it that’s all i hope to hell it’s enough

you naked in my bed is even more unbelievably beautiful than i thought it would be and trust me ive thought about it a lot

scholars theologians and even poets have yet to be able to truly describe and touch upon the beauty romance and magic of a relationship built on  authenticity

but harry    even if we had met and married three years ago you’d still say it wasn’t enough time

you’re right i can’t think of a single day of my life that wouldn’t have been improved with you in it

darling she whispered her fingertips coming up to stroke his jaw that’s lovely even more romantic than comparing me to watch parts

harry nipped at her finger are you mocking me

not at all poppy said smiling i know how you feel about gears and mechanisms

i find myself fascinated by a man who admits to enjoying fairy tales and uses the word impinge barely misses a beat while indulging in a brief girlongirl fantasy youre a man of layers ford

me and shrek were onions

with the energy

of the mornings

trace your fingers

along the lull

of the afternoons

take the spirit

of the evenings

in your arms

kiss it deeply

and then

to the tranquility

of the nights

i feel like i should probably ask you to leave but i don’t really want you to go i want you to stay but i know you shouldn’t

he moves suddenly so that his hand is cupping my sex and one of his fingers sinks slowly into me his other arm holds me firmly in place around my waist

this is mine he whispers aggressively all mine do you understand he eases his finger in and out as he gazes down at me gauging my reaction his eyes burning

yes yours…

abruptly he moves doing several things at once withdrawing his fingers leaving me wanting unzipping his fly and pushing me down onto the couch so he’s lying on top of me

hands on your head he commands through gritted teeth as he kneels up forcing my legs wider…

we don’t have long this will be quick and it’s for me not you do you understand

don’t come or i will spank you he says through clenched teeth

the only problem with oneman woman was that he was not a onewoman man

don’t make a feller wait too long a feller waiting on a gal can get ornery’er than a huntin’ dog that’s tree’d it’s squirrel

i’ve never cheated on a lover i’m faithful always but the war comes before anyone’s feelings every time

wow battle before love without a doubt he was the most unromantic male she’d ever met even more so than her greatgrandfather who had laughingly burned her greatgrandmother to death after she’d given birth to gwen’s grandmother

my dearest julianne

thank you for your immeasurable gift

the only thing i have of value is my heart

it’s yours

there is nothing more beautiful than a vulnerable heart in open hands

you are my fantasy on a cold dark night my muse during the light of day and the one wish my soul would make

he’d used the amulet to read my thoughts again

i pictured smacking him in the face

i know my heart it has always been yours kate always

what in the blue starblazes did you see in jason he asked still forcefully but with his frustration and jealousy under better control

for one thing djetth he wasnt trying to kill me

we all romanticize the people we adore

love is elixir that keeps you alive love is poison that kills you unreciprocated love keeps you alive but kills every day

if you dont do anything you simply end up overwhelmed by something happening

thats the choice i love him with all that because of all that on purpose i love him on purpose

what a woman you are he murmured and she heard the emotion in it the

way the irish thickened just a bit in his voice and saw it in those vivid eyes when he drew back that you would think of this that you would do this

he shook his head kissed her like the breath long and quiet

i can’t thank you enough there isn’t enough thanks i can’t say what this means to me even to you i don’t have the words for it he took her hands

brought them both to his lips a ghra you stagger me

he framed her face now touched his lips to her brow you’re the beat of my heart the breath in my body the light in my soul

i tried to think of something to say excuse me hello marry me anything would have done

ill think of you just like i promised

and ill think of you just like i have every day tamani said

sometimes heni think i would give my life just for one of your smiles

and then to leo’s surprise catherine smiled at him a sweet natural brilliant smile the first she had ever given him leo felt his chest tighten and he went hot all over as if some euphoric drug had gone straight to his nervous system

it felt like … happiness

he remembered happiness from a long time ago he didn’t want to feel it and yet the giddy warmth kept washing over him for no reason whatsoever

thank you catherine said the smile still hovering on her lips that is kind of you my lord but i will never dance with you

which of course made it the goal of leo’s life

curse him for being all tight muscle with ivory skin and a mouth as soft as rose petals curse him for having hair as fair as the sun and eyes as black as night curse him for having the grace of a cat and deft cool hands

and now i am having the same argument on paper that i have in my own head on too many nights i know my choice is sensible but it isnt my common sense i think with those times rostos stolen a kiss from me

anyway i cleared my throat loudly thank you again for the beautiful necklace its perfect and i love it where did you find it ive never seen anything like it before

it was his turn to look embarrassed and he ducked his head thats because i made it he peeked up at me and my heart melted am i dreaming this has to be a dream

you made it something wet hit my cheek and i brushed it away impatiently waiting for his answer

yeah he said shyly i did

some minutes or hours or days later when i lay boneless and well satisfied ethan raised his gaze to mine again his eyes were silver his fangs descended there is no going back he said not after this

give me some sugar

my panties were still on but he didn’t let that stop him nosing them out of the way and tonguing my sex making low growling noises in his throat like a big cat purring with pleasure while it devoured its prey

you love me he said that’s all i need to know

you always say the right thing savannah told him her eyes so filled with love that he almost wept sometimes it takes you awhile to get to it but you always get there and what you say is always worth waiting for

if you want the rainbow you have to deal with the rain

want to know the best part of being a warlord came a hoarse whisper

i bit my lip puzzled by the question

keir’s mouth curled up slowly into a smile i always get what i want

except he found himself remembering lying in bed with alec—all of their clothes on lounging on the bed on a lazy afternoon alec laughing head thrown back the marks magnus had left on his throat very plain to see

bellamy took clarke’s hand then leaned in and whispered should we go check on your parents

she turned to him and tilted her head to the side don’t you think it’s a little early to be meeting my parents she teased after all we’ve been dating less than a month

a month in earth time is like ten years in space time don’t you think

clarke nodded you’re right and i suppose that means that i can’t get mad at you if you decide to call it off after a few months because that’s really a few decades

bellamy wrapped his arm around her waist and drew her close i want to spend eons with you clarke griffin

she rose onto her toes and kissed his cheek glad to hear it because there’s no going back now we’re here for good

when lovers kiss on the cheeks it is because they are searching feeling for one anothers lips lovers are made by a kiss

if i am never to have you again after this night this moment you will remain the wife of my soul keeper of my heart

picnics are very dear to those who are in the first stage of the tender passion

i stare at her for a long moment i want to kiss her i want to kiss her more than ive ever wanted anything in my life

because i don’t believe that you are a slave to what you’ve become i don’t believe that you simply can’t

don’t call me babe i’m not a floozy or a freaking talking pig

it is as if quincey has replaced the sun in my universe and it is around him that i spin

im glad you escaped kyra fred said looking serious again and that i found you

me too kyra said glancing up at him it wouldnt have been much of a life trying to live in the dumbwaiter

fred leaned down and kissed kyra full on the lips

kyra pulled away how do you know im interested in you just because youve decided im worth hanging around for doesnt mean i feel the same way

fred cocked his head at her really

then she kissed him back

beh reaches up and touches my cheek

love she whispers

luffs i respond and her smile brightens even more

without a doubt i will do anything for her

you are the trip i did not take you are the pearls i could not buy

you are my blue italian lake you are my piece of foreign sky

you are my honolulu moon you are the book i did not write

you are my hearts unuttered tune you are a candle in my night

you are the flower beneath the snow in my dark sky a bit of blue

answering disappointments blow with i am happy i have you

i think of you only twice a day  when i am alone and when i am with someone else

she’d felt it before she felt it now the pull to fall in with him to fall into him to lose her sense of self

the moment you stop chasing happiness you become happy

i wonder if hell ever see the truth in my own heart that whatever dustpelt says however much fireheart breaks the warrior code i love him more that i could imagine loving any other cat and if fireheart knew would he love me too

a muffled voice startled them both

when are you going to kiss her

another figure stood among them this one had his arms folded across his chest stiff and firm and formal

yet he did not look displeased

my love for you wont stop with my leaving come an evening over the years when you step outside your door and hear the wind blowing through the cottonwoods thatll be me thinking of you whispering your name and loving you

you might not understand but i gave you the best of me and after you left nothing was ever the same

its me a deep voice rumbled

tori waited until derek was gone then shuddered okay derek always weired me out but the wolf man stuff is seriously creepy suits him i suppose a creepy power for a creepy guy

i thought he looked better

she stared at me

what he does probably because hes starting his wolf changes and hes not stressed out about being in lyle house that must help

you know what will really help shampoo deodorant

i raised my hand to cut her off he smelled fine so dont start that im sure his wearing deodorant and  for onceits working as for showers theyre a little hard to come by on the street and we wont look much better soon

im just saying

do you think he doesnt know youre saying news flashhes not stupid

see dont just look your partner is so much more than their appearance its how kind their heart is how lovely they smile how much they care and have compassion how generous and giving they are which becomes much more attractive

weve got a bond in common you and i we are both alone in the world

emma turned to him bottom lip trembling for me

always for you all things for you he coughed into his fist all your own

my task is set before me girl

my mission clear and true

there’ll be black knights and dragons girl

but i will always come for you…

theres no reason to think were going to stop loving each other he said and theres every reason to think that we wont

she said it was beautiful to be loved and that it made everything on earth look brighter

your beauty took my breath away but your mind has stopped my heart

this is sailor supergirl george says she knows all about black holes

clearly the sight of a wellmuscled forearm incited a woman to utter depravity how else to explain the invention of cuffs

when he reached her he touched a hand to her face smiled important thats one word everything thats another loved he said adding the most important word of all god darcy you are so loved

dont take this next undercover assignment stay with me instead

nicks eyes pierced hers refusing to let her off that easily tell me why

because i love you she exhaled no takebacks the words were out there forever

and it felt great

why are you pretending to write when i already know youre just doing that to intimidate me

i cant take anything you dont give me stop giving me power over your life

and your life katie said to christy is turning into a rather predictable romance girl meets boy boy is a dork for four years girl blossoms into a gorgeous woman boy finds his brain girl turns into starryeyed mush head

popcorn chocolate coffee ice cream and pizza the five food groups health nuts are going to feel stupid one day dying of nothing

if you can forget the person you love you have not loved enough

you know if you would just do as i say i wouldnt have to hurt you

innocence invites protection yet we might be smarter to protect ourselves against it

there were books about how to be gay hed seen them in stores and libraries some of them even had diagrams but there werent any diagrams about how to fall in love with your best friend and not fuck everything up

finally she loved someone and felt fairly confident that she was loved in return if someone asked emma as they sometimes did at parties how she and her husband had met she told them

‘we grew up together

i’ll be your friend in daylight i’ll treat you as a comrade in every gaslit ballroom but alone under moonlight i’ll not pretend that i want you for anything but mine

youve got an awfully kissable mouth

there is no law stronger than that of

sonetimes the hardest person to forgive is yourself

i look for you in every life but i dont always find you and sometimes i find you too late

but she woke up just then and in the moonlight covered herself with a blanket she smiled at him drowsily and called him yero my hero and that melted his heart

together we form a necessary paradox not a senseless contradiction

catch me seth she invited

he paused

faeries chase he said an then  with a flirtatious smile he turned away but before he could take a second step she was behind him arms around him lips pressed against his neck

i seem caught he murmured

the summer queen whispered me too

and they fell together in a bed of flowers that now covered the floor

of course not leo said acidly my family would never bother with something so insignificant as job experience i’m sure they started the interview by asking what her favorite color was

and only now when he was grayhaired had he fallen in love properly thoroughly for the first time in his life

i’m not sure i trust myself around you i liked you from the start jd i really wish things had been different thats all

i didn’t mean to fall in love with you but i did

that it would always be summer and autumn and you always courting me and always thinking as much of me as you have done through the past summertime

he caught her and he held her and he let her cry and cry and cry and he let her use his sheets to wipe her eyes and her nose and god knows what because he had plenty of clean sheets and he only had one kat

how much time do i get in exchange for that rose

for the rose a short engagement for the speech you get a lifetime

i can live with that he said and kissed her

when they write my obituary tomorrow or the next day it will say leo gursky is survived by an apartment full of shit

her gaze met his her blue eyes filled with confusion and terror – and love if julian hadn’t already been in love with her that would have done it

i certainly do care for you jeff campbell less than you are always thinking and much more than you are ever knowing

asukayoure really cute when i look at youi start wanting to protect you

i let myself have feelings for you despite not knowing how this would end

it was like someone in a suit walked up to me and gave me a certificate which stated roxanne giselle logan your life is fucked

so are you a hero cole walker

what is a hero really

i suppose it’s someone that saves people

yeah i suppose it is

so do you save people

i’m only fifteen give me a chance

as a rule of thumb it was always safer if the commanderinchief formulated a risky plan

for there are no limits to the stars their numbers are infinite which is precisely why i measure my love for you by them an amount too boundless to count

i love you clary he said without looking at her he was staring out into the church at the row of lighted candles their fold reflected in his eyes more than i ever he broke off god more than i probably should you know that dont you

my god jack  with a look like that you two should just get a room and try not to pick the one with a dead body next to it this time

he tastes of white wine and apple pie and christian i run my fingers through his hair holding him to me while our tongues explore and curl and twist around each other my blood heating in my veinswere breathless when christian pulls away

you have captured me utterly and you hold my heart in your hands be gentle with it its more fragile than you might think

two farewell gifts sadie muttered from two gorgeous guys i hate my life

i promise ill never tell

dont promise that he said in an ultraserious voice if they try to hurt you and the only way to protect yourself is to tell them what you know about me then you tell them straight off okay

no

no

i will possess your heart

heat flared along the back of my neck what did you say

my favorite song i will possess your heart

by death cab for cutie

he snorted no the little known ti hiphop remix yes death cab for cutie

why whats wrong with it

nothing but it doesnt seem to fit you its kind of a sad song

no its pure confident its not i want or i need none of that crap he slipped his hand over mine its i will

a nervous laugh bubbled up you will huh

his fingers brushed my cheek then slid into my hair i will

i watched you while you were sleeping and you looked completely at peace i wish i could feel that i wish i could close my eyes and feel at peace but i can’t i can’t feel anything if i’m not

with you and even then all i can do is want something that i don’t think i can ever have at least not now so i left this and my peace with you stark

i’m fairly certain captain she said that the more you discover about me the more you will dislike me therefore let’s cut to the chase and acknowledge that we don’t like each other then we won’t have to bother with the inbetween part

she was so bloody frank and practical about the whole thing that christopher couldn’t help but be amused

i’m afraid i can’t oblige you

why not

because when you said that just now i found myself starting to like you

you’ll recover she said

her decisive tone made him want to smile it’s getting worse actually he told her now i’m absolutely convinced that i like you

beatrix gave him a patently skeptical stare what about my hedgehog do you like her too

christopher considered that affection for rodents can’t be rushed

medusa isn’t a rodent she’s an erinaceid

ive tried that love thing for the last time my heart says no no nobodys supposed to be here but you came along and changed my mind

that later makes lovers take

while maddox now believed the demon did not want to hurt ashlyn he wasnt willing to take a chance he would talk about flowers and moonbeams  he cringed  if it meant maintaining this delectable inner peace

is there a way to break your deathcurse ashlyn asked so much for flowers and moonbeams

he wondered grimly what he was going to do about it

he was not amused

or in any way pleased

my words are the kisses but many of the times they dont taste so good as the touch of your lips does to mine

theres always be a me and you

big lots i said seeing the eightyyearold oaks and shady lawns the houses were set way back and had iron fences and stone drives

the harder to hear your neighbors scream my dear was david’s answer and i sent my head up and down in agreement

my thoughts are all over the place as i fall asleep and images of clouded roses and angry green eyes flow through my dreams

if id had enough breath i would have screamed both at the sensation and at the sheer pettiness of the bastard who wouldnt allow me even a tiny chance of escape

youre okay now youre okay because ill be holding you like this from now on

i miss those kisses and the way i used to sleep in your warm hug i miss the way you made me eat breakfasts and i miss the way you made me laugh i miss you

a womans got one life shes got to reach out and grab it with both hands or itll pass her by and leave nothing but a smelly old fart in her face

okay that ones pretty good fred acknowledged after shed told him a particularly filthy joke but have you heard the one about the bakers wife

no kyra said

rumor has it she married him for his buns fred burst out laughing

kyra groaned okay that was just bad

i would be consumed by you she said and blinked her eyes furiously when she felt them fill with tears you would sap all the energy and all the joy from me you would put out all the fire of my vitality

give me a chance to fan the flames of that fire he said and to nurture your joy

for the first time in a long time i want more than i have

i had a romance novel inside me but i paid three sailors to beat it out of me with steel pipes

his hand snapped shut over the device and then he crossed his arms aria stared in horror her smarteye was buried in a neanderthal’s armpit

i didn’t want to cry in front of you

he wiped away the tears with the pad of his thumb

i want you to cry only in front of me

the intensity

in your eyes

burns my pen

as i write

i think back to what landon said about heartbreak that if you don’t love the person they can’t break your heart hardin repeatedly breaks my heart even when i don’t think there are any more pieces to break

and i love him i love hardin

she laid her head against his collarbone and he kissed her temple to her shock she felt a shudder roll through his body about the same time she registered wetness against her skin tears his tears

she started to turn around but he tightened his grip

stay he said in a choked voice just let me hold you baby just let me hold you

she is the crescendo the final astonishing work of god woman in one last flourish creation comes to a finish with eve she is the masters finishing touch

worth it and perfect are different things no one’s perfect yet in romance everyone becomes worth it and that’s the trick

you had to keep the blade up however and rewrap the hilt from time to time and doublecheck the weight

funnyall of that was well duh when it came to weapons why hadnt it dawned on him that matings were the same

from the thoughts of vishous

missing you is worse than pittsburgh

she took a deep breath last chance are you in need of rescuing

his expression turned very strange almost as if shed struck him yes he said finally

you wouldnt have taken rose to such a place would you

of course not but she is a little girl and im

my life he interrupted quietly youre my entire life if anything ever happens to you holly there is nothing left for me

annabelle gave him a chiding smile if you’re implying that i’m spoiled i assure you that i am not

you should be his warm gaze slid over her pinktinted face and slender upper body then sought hers again there was a note in his voice that gently robbed her of breath you could do with a bit of spoiling

she sniffled does he know

not a clue law said there are concrete bricks less dense than my beloved

ben kissed me like he could kiss me forever like he had to kiss me forever and he wanted to he wanted me and when he felt my surprise at that i could feel again how beautiful i was to him how i was beautiful beyond words

fresh sweet honeysuckle ripe and rich and ready to be fucked—

plucked he corrected himself ready to be plucked

love is photogenic it develops in the dark

im your enemy meghan never forget that if mab tells me to kill you in front of the entire court its my duty to obey

you are brave and loyal and true you have such a good heart he held my hand close to his chest and covered it with his other hand it is only afraid but i would take such good care of it love if you would give it to me

right because if you have trouble putting ketchup and mustard on a hot dog you should totally move on to saving lives

do you like him much

i told you i like him a little where is the use of caring for him so very much he is full of faults

is he

all boys are

more than girls

very likely wise people say it is folly to think anyboy perfect and as to likes and diskiles we should be friendly to all and worship none

you are i think an evening star

the fairest of all the stars

girls get under each others skin we get too close too attached too crazy and then we cant let go our claws sink too deep when we separate we tear each other apart

i never pay for sex alayna when i fuck you it will be for free

roses i swear you men have all your romance from the same worn book flowers are a good thing a sweet thing to give a lady but it is always roses always red and always perfect hothouse blooms when they can come by them

i know this woman

who the hell is she

he stared both his brothers down she’s mine

you want the fairy tale

i want a chance at it

neither of us says the word love not once it would be tempting fate it would be romance bad luck

she inched closer to him i intrigue you

you know you do he replied boldly his eyes burning into hers wowthings were suddenly heating up fast he wondered if they would have sex right there on her desksomebody better move that stapler

with a coy look taylor stood up to whisper in jasons ear

then i think youre going to find this next part really intriging she said breathlessly

he gazed down at herhe like the sound of thatand raised one eybrow expectantly as taylor grinned wickedly and

slammed the office door right in his face

for a moment jason could only stand there in the hallway with his nose pressed against the cold wood of her door after a few seconds he knocked politely

jason grinned at her i just gotta ask where did you get the whole all the cute girls run around naked thing

oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you

and by those who resemble you god forbid that i should undervalue

the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellowcreatures

i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment

and constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable

of everything great and good in your married lives i believe you equal

to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance

so long asif i may be allowed the expressionso long as you have

an object i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you

all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one

you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence

or when hope is gone

you lose yourself erica because with the right person who you become together is something so much greater more than you could even realize right now

ah azalea said the king hes not going to be the one proposing

the springs in azaleas feet went poioioing

sorry she said

you outrank him you know the king shifted uncomfortable it would be highly inappropriate for him to propose to you the delchastrian queen had to propose

i will do no such thing said azalea

over the years everyone stumbles thats why ill be here for you — and youll be there for me i dont expect perfection i want you and youre a thousand times better

for the first time in my life i said the words i need a drink

let me feel how thy pulses beat

id spent a night with ranger a while ago and i knew what happened when he was encouraged ranger knew how to make a woman want him ranger was magic

yet i am stuck in the idea of romance a dreamer i want to actually fall in love with a man then marry him

and to think of all the colors in the world blood chose to be red

without realizing what she was doing and more on an impulse than anything else she leaned forward and kissed him it was a simple yet firm kiss and she pulled back after only a moment but it sent a thrill through her

he leaned down for another but she put her finger on his lips to stop him

that was my reward to you she said as they danced dont squander it

reward he asked still seeming both surprised and delighted at this unexpected attention what for

why for living vaelros and for doing so much else to help me i will have you rewarded in state as well but that was just from me

she saw vaelros flush and she gave him a brilliant smile you dont like my reward she asked

i do he replied i want only to learn how to earn more

the music was fading the song was ending luthiel stepped back and let her hands drop

a mysterious thing my heart she said

he wont be one of those girlishly pretty men with curly gold hairhell be dark dangerous too brave certainly but not without flaws i like my heroes human

was this some new level of depravity had he developed a spinster fetish

hanson got to sleep with you and i didnt he said his own jaw a little tight so i stole his car

how do you feel she asked trying to fluff his pillow other than terrible i mean

he moved his head slightly to the side it seemed to be a sickly interpretation of a shrug

of course you’re feeling terrible she clarified but is there any change more terrible less terrible

he made no response

the same amount of terrible

have you any other objection than your belief of my indifference

that settles it no more books about vampire before bedtime

and there in the midst of blinding orange yellow and white flames our forever begins

i was flipping channels watching this cheerleading program on mtv they took a field hockey girl and transformed her into a cheerleader by the end of the show i was just wondering what if she liked field hockey better

and she was able to tell herself with some satisfaction the man in question  one colin bridgerton  felt precisely the same way

his earth shook his heart leaped and penelope knew without a doubt that his breath was taken away as well for a good ten seconds

falling off a horse tended to do that to a man

maybe that’s what i have been looking for when storms and rockslides threaten i am looking for someone who will hold on to me and not let go

once he hadnt been able to touch her without causing himself pain now it only hurt when he didnt touch her

where are we going annabelle asked resisting his hold on her wrist

to the house if they’re not willing to be witnesses then it seems i’ll have to debauch you in front of someone else

im still trying to decide how i feel about the fact that you knew about this before i did

dont be disappointed jack said the fact that ive been ridiculously proud of you for days doesnt change how excited you should be about this besides i pretty much know everything you should probably just start getting used to it

and on that note im hanging up cameron said

rushing me off so you can call collin next jack teased

no she said emphatically

damn he really did know everything

goodness had nothing to do with it

suffer love a good ephitet i do suffer love indeed for i love thee against my will

its taken me all this time all this loss to realize what really matters is now

miss bridgerton he said the devil himself couldn’t scare you

she forced her eyes to meet his that’s not a compliment is it

he lifted her hand to his lips brushing a featherlight kiss across her knuckles you’ll have to figure that out for yourself he murmured

and then he straightened as if nothing had happened and said do let me know what you decide

she just stared at him

about the compliment he added i am sure you will wish to let me know how i feel about you

he smiled broadly speechless even i’m to be commended

you—

no no he said lifting one hand in the air and pointing toward her as if what he really wanted to do was place his finger on her lips and shush her don’t ruin it the moment is too rare

thats what came from having romance in your soul you believe in things like love at first sight and perfect presents

sanay hindi umiikot ang mundo at tumatanda ang panahon

id rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you

robert i’m sorry that you feel so strange but i’m not sorry that you’re feeling it because of me i whispered my heart feeling a familiar twinge as i continued but even if you hadn’t felt it it would not change the way i feel about you

yeah cause that would be a smart choice so i should just forget about the whole lying to me thing when you pronounce you will never do it again

you’d have a better chance getting a donkey to shit gold

when i turn back to jase he’s again beaming at me you’re nice he sounds pleased as if he hadn’t expected this aspect of my personality

he leaned upon her as if there was no other support anywhere in the world and she held him as if she would undertake no other task for all eternity

a laugh jumps out of my mouth surprising me i can’t even remember the last time i laughed and it puts me on edge i suddenly want to do the same thing to her let her see how it feels to teeter on that cliff

if for some reason we get separated i want you to wait for me i’ll find you i promise  gabriel emerson

love is an emotion experienced by the many and enjoyed by the few

even when everything that should have been has not been we can still seek to give some elbow room willingly for romance to heal the cracks of life feeling like a fallen star

as i nodded and smiled and ummhmmd and oh myd my way down the drive i wondered if boys had any sort of magazine that told them how to attract women and if so did it ever tell them to put the girls interests first

for this was the round of love fear which leads on desire tenderness and fury and that brutal anguish which triumphantly follows pleasure

dignity is overrated you know what trumps dignity kissing

i generally find subtlety a waste of time

she couldnt do any worse but then he couldnt do better so maybe it balanced out

lie beside me oh my beloved for thy thorns are more pleasurable than the petals of the world

hold me in thy arms of hope for the truth of separation can rest tonight

you make the rest of the beautiful things in the world cry for even trying at all you make it hard for me to breathe

did you miss me’

a little bit she said with a shrug

you have tears running down your cheeks he said with a grin i think you missed me more than a little

what’s your favorite place to visit he absently answered wherever you are

bowen five things about you can’t all be about me

but you’re the only good thing that i’ve got

when she opened her door levi was sitting in the hallway his legs bent in front of him hunched forward on his knees he looked up when she stepped out

i’m such an idiot he said

cath fell between his knees and hugged him

i can’t believe i said that he said i can’t even go nine hours without seeing you

he felt like home

alexander tilted his head and kissed her deeply on the lips he let go of her hands and she wrapped her arms around his neck pressing herself against him they kissed as if in a fever they kissed as if the breath were leaving their bodies

no not really but … okay i couldn’t help but gloat a little she likes me

samedi didn’t even look at me well of course you’ve had that bloody uniform on all day i was half ready to tell you how much i liked you

she shook her head as she confessed i want it so much im afraid to hope

never be afraid to hope rohan said gently its the

only way to begin

rohan to win

so you want me to go to a human orgy where i will not be welcome and you want us to leave before i get to enjoy myself eric northman

when they’re together the world could fall apart around them and they’d never notice or care as long as they have each other

about alex and brittany

love is a vessel that contains both security and adventure and commitment offers one of the great luxuries of life time marriage is not the end of romance it is the beginning

she doesn’t need the pack she doesn’t need me

i shot to my feet that’s not true i said hotly

nellie grinned i always wanted to go to venice its supposed to be the romance capital of the world

sweet put in dan too bad your date is an egyptian mau on a hunger strike

the au pair sighed better than an elevenyearold with a big mouth

when he kissed me his lips soft and careful it was all the thrill of our first kiss and all the practiced familiarity of the accumulated memory of all our kisses

frowning she looked up you cant want to ravish me every time we meet

oh yes he could demon gritted his teeth

humor was the enemy of desire

romance has been elegantly defined as the offspring of fiction and love

i shant mind if you dont he agreed but ill not let you go prudence til not pester you but know this i will wait until you choose to listen to your heart

pshaw it was a feeble effort she took a deep breath and tried again humbug how can you presume to know my heart

he smiled a slow devastating smile you are my heart he lifted her hand and kissed it and our hearts beat in tune i know it—i who used not to believe in such things and you know it

bet you ten bucks we make it

what are the odds she thought and realized with sudden blinding clarity that she wouldnt take the other side of that bet that only a loser would bet against them this is really it she thought amazed this is really forever i believe in this

min he said and she kissed him putting all her heart into it

no bet she said against his mouth your odds are too good

our odds are too good

man is the candle light and a woman is the moonlight they live far away but can grow together during lonesome nights

his right ear still held both studs and i wondered who had the missing earring i would have asked but was afraid he’d tell me ivy had it

im not asking you for a second chance i know better than that but youve got no right to ask me to settle for sex then expect me to give up the one thing thats kept me going i gave you up now im taking whats left

you didnt give me up she tossed back you never wanted me

i never wanted anything the way i wanted you i loved you he dragged her painfully to her toes ive always loved you i cut my own heart out when i sent you away

tears and sighs when the hero dies

but the curtain fall is final

when in life we take the tragic way

the sunset too is a glorious thing

but with it ends the day

jase props himself up on an elbow looking at me for a minute without saying anything his face gets an unreadable expression and i wish i could take back walking over

then he observes i’m guessing that’s a uniform

crap i’d forgotten i was still wearing it

the morning will come in the press of every kiss with your head upon my chest where i will annoy you with every waking breath until you decide to wake up

i believe in love and i know love conquers all

my ideas about vampires may be romantic but your attitudes toward women need a major overhaul

you  me

saw this

thank you for finding america with me

are you going to kiss me i blabbered stupidly

im working up the nerve he said softly

no matter how happily a woman may be married it always pleases her to discover that there is a nice man who wishes that she were not

she shook off the selfrecrimination whatifs and couldhavebeens were not the way to move forward she knew that from experience

you realize that is you allow me to court you all your opposition to marriage is going to have to be reconsidered

she smiled feigning innocencewhat opposition to marriage

but im thinking we should have a long courtship

why he looked surprised

because i find ive developed a taste for adventure

that sounds dangerous not at all in character for a delicate flower

she laughed we know ive never been good at being a delicate flower besides it shant be too dangerous

how can you be so sure

she smiled brilliantly at him taking his breath away

because on my next adventure ill have you by my side

will you be my forever donia

will you walk with me out on the wire cuz baby im just a scared and lonely rider but i gotta know how it feels i want to know love is wild babe i want to know love is real

you realise you’re going to owe me dinner after this right

how does mcdonald’s sound

bobby tom finally understood gracies function in his life she was gods joke on him

blake took a small roll from the tray on the table then put it back in favor of a larger one and maybe a little butter it certainly couldnt hurt and jamno he drew the line at jam she was a spy after all

there is something about me doll face it’s between my legs and i do believe a few minutes ago you were praying to it

youre what ive been looking for my whole life and if you let me ill love you for the rest of yours

my soul will always find its way to yours because home is where the heart is

patti told me that to truly love someone you must hold them in an open hand that was how i needed to love kai it was necessary to uncurl my fingers and let him go

my house seems remarkably full of people he observed is it possible we were expected

sometimes just getting through each day requires almost superhuman strength

how could you fall in love with a three inch worm

there are much more important qualities to have than a docile disposition

his hands may have been the one to heal you but it will be mine that awaken you

sorryʺ she said her face shining with joy when she saw me ʺshould have put a sock on the door didnʹt realize things were getting hot and heavyʺ

ʺno avoiding itʺ i said lightly clasping dimitriʹs hand ʺthings are always hot with him aroundʺ

dimitri looked scandalized heʹd never held back when we were in bed together but his private nature wouldnʹt let him even hint about such matters to others it was mean but i laughed and kissed his cheek

ʺoh this is going to be funʺ i said ʺnow that everythingʹs out in the openʺ

ʺyeahʺ he said ʺi got a pretty ‘funʹ look from your father the other day

he would ask nothing else from life if he would be allowed to protect and cherish her for the rest of his

youre my wings you made me fly

youre the one who made it seem like we were doing something wrong maybe you still feel like that because for whatever reason you think im not good enough for you but i like you okay ive liked you from the very beginning

it was never going anywhere

because you wouldnt let it go anywhere

im going to hell im pretty sure shed going to drag me there herself

never be afraid to tell me anything he whispered against her hair no matter how ashamed you might feel i’ll never judge you rachel i love you

i would actually write books totally full of nothing but kissing scenes but apparently people like books to have like plots or whatever

love one another love yourself then love will find you whole not half

just remember that the only question in a house is who is to rule the rest is only dancing around that trying not to look it in the eye

dad i pleaded this is so cuss word you never ever say in front of your mother ridiculous

i love her and thats the beginning and end of everything

you dont want me to feel obligated well im sorry lily i am here

because i feel obligated he brought her hand to his chest pressing her

palm flat against his rapidly thumping pulse im obligated by my heart its

we can do anything you like just be with me

i wont be affected by your charm nor i will trap you into marriage ive been there once never again

i’ve never heard of a man being so eager to confess to the parent of a girl he’s just ruined

when you sit that way you look kind of like a beach ball with a head he continued your haircut is really really bad i’m probably going to lose my job for helping you this way and i’m dying to fuck you

he glanced at her that honest enough for you

im ending this

no come on its not worth it

you are he said fiercely looking at her

youre worth it

it frightens me that i cant do anything sensible about it

are you scared that youll wind up with a boring job where you have to see the same people every day and drink instant coffee

im more scared that ill forget the feeling i have now

kind of like how you forgot how it feels to be three years old

that surely ill wind up thinking i was so young i didnt really understand everything it bothers me that i know i will be wrong

what she whispered

tell me what to do to fix it

she shook her head and closed her eyes as though she couldn’t bear to see him you can’t fix it

he had to failure here was not an option let me try

foolishly romantic yeah sure maybe but shed rather have dreams of prince charming than the reality of mr wrong

the guy in bed with her was not nathan which meant elle was bucknaked and wantonly riding the wrong guy

id lost myself in the abyss of someone elses tyrannyagain

with kisses like that i wish this was the universe where you were my soulfinder

if you neglected to warn djetth beforehand that you were going to shoot him down your highness he may consider you in breach of contract

rough palms cradled my face while my fingers gripped the pillow on either side of his lips teeth tongue mingled together i ate him up and didn’t let go until i had to come up for air

haven’t you got any romance in your soul’ said magrat plaintively

she could not leave him hanging like this if you were hurt i need to know it was a rule somewhere in the goodguy handbook

just because lips have met doesnt mean hearts have joined and just because two bodies are drawn to each other doesnt mean two people are right for each other a physical relationship does not equal love

never sleep with a lady only once especially in the case of an older lady

ah well he smiledanother one of those devastatingly intoxicating smiles that did unreasonable things to her body temperature and respiration

with a nod and a respectful ma’am he left her in the middle of the room

feeling like she’d been hit by a tank

people loved you in the way they knew how  and often it was not the way you knew or needed

youll want all your strength for the wedding night

i cannot think why i should need strength she said ignoring a host of spinetingling images rising in her minds eye all i have to do is lie there

naked he said grimly

the what

it was ghastly expensive she said but the silk is as fine as gossamer and the eyelet work about the neckline is exquisite aunt louisa was horrified she said only cyprians wear such things and it leaves nothing to the imagination

jessica heard him suck in his breath felt the muscular thigh tense against hers

but if it were left to aunt louisa she went oni should be covered from my chin to my toes in thick cotton ruffled with monstrosities with little bows and rosebuds which is absurd when an evening gown reveals far more not to mention

what color he asked his low voice had roughened

jess her name was a strangled whisper

slippers to match she continued black mules with

jess in one furious flurry of motion he threw down the reins and hauled her into his lap

weve been wed more than a month since it appears you mean to stay i might as well give you leave to call me by my christian name it is preferable at any rate to clodpole

novan bassists are very good with their fingers

novan and some of us sing backup vocals so that means were good with our mouths too

im chat with novan chang  bassist

would you like to hear more romance of the evening he told me that the guard should be reduced by half and i threw an ink jar at his head

is that when he cried

he ducked attolia said dryly

grown more confident of the queens humor relius said i had not pictured you for a fishwife

lo the transforming power of love

its your heart no one else gets a say in that

he was too gorgeous for words and worst yet he knew it

this has to be the most selfcentered thing ive ever said but no i think you just wanted to vex me

she has to agree to have me it could take some time but i’m confident i can trick her into it

v had a passing thought that she used the word anyway like an eraser on a crowded chalkboard she said it whenever she needed to clear off the things shed just shared to make room for more

he gripped her nape i fuckin love you regin rain spiked his lashes as he gazed down at her commanding her

oh cameron eldon replied in a whisper moving closer and brushing his lips over camerons mouth you are literally the very reason my heart beats nothing i have lost can compare with the love in you i have found

i hope i havent given you the impression that i consider kissing intrinsically irrational

excuse me i said palms down on the formica tabletop coffee i thought we came here for pie i dont eat the kind of pie they serve here i felt a flash of heat go through my stomach i knew firsthand the kind of pie ranger liked

i’m going to carry you now he told her so we can move even faster i’m not asking you i’m telling you any response from you is unnecessary and unwelcome

he loved her

he wanted her

he needed her

and he needed her now

i want you she said

i told you so he said

madelyne were married now tis a usual occurrence to bed ones wife on the wedding night

i want him to burn for me to not be able to go a day without touching me holding me caressing me he’ll be an excellent lover i want a man who knows how to please me

you will like her he persisted egad shes after your own heart maman she shot me in the arm

voyons do you think that is what i like

emotions don’t interfere in my acting nor in my life

im not throwing you away im setting you free

and she swung the old oar at him with all her strength

it hit with a great thwack splintering in two and he went over the side into the dark cold waters of the lake sinking like a stone

it took her two seconds and then she let out a scream for help tossing the broken oar away from her and jumped into the water after him

it was very cold numbingly so and as it closed over her head she grabbed for

him wrapping her arms around his body ready to sink to the bottom with him

instead he kicked pushing them up so that they broke the surface his arm

clamped around hers as she struggled jesus woman he snapped when did we have to become romeo and juliet

a letter is a soul so faithful an echo of the speaking voice that to the sensitive it is among the richest treasures of love

sorry he said let me drop the belt

no she held on when he would have pulled away don’t i like it

again he lifted her face and he smiled the tool belt turns you on

no she closed her eyes and thunked her forehead to his chest little bit

if a castle gets destroyed you just build a new one if you wanted me to id build them over and over lets build them together

it is i’m your boyfriend now which

means there’s no room for your hipster admirer he’ll just have to lick his wounds while we lick other things

i dont know what the future holds i only know that i want to be with you you and me everything else is negotiable

i knew right then you were the only one for me he pulled her hand

she nodded

this heart is yours its yours he said it always will be

love me madeline asked with a faint smile

it used to be love he brushed his lips over her closed eyelids now theres no word for it

you once told me that you thought love was a weakness

i was wrong he whispered kissing the corners of her mouth ive discovered its my only strength

this is not something anyone can teach you heartbreak you must learn on your own

that is what i like about you mr dashwood she said you are so decisive it saves me the bother of thinking for myself

that is what i like about you mrs dashwood he said you are so sarcastic it saves me the trouble of trying to be tactful and charming

i thought i was going to die i wanted to die and i thought if i was going to die i would die with you

someone like you young as i am i saw so many dying near me in the last year i didn’t feel scared i

certainly wasn’t brave just now i thought to myself we have this villa this grass we should have lain

down together you in my arms before we died i wanted to touch that bone at your neck collarbone

it’s like a small hard wing under your skin i wanted to place my fingers against it i’ve always liked flesh

the colour of rivers and rocks or like the brown eye of a susan do you know what that flower is have

you seen them i am so tired kip i want to sleep i want to sleep under this tree put my eye against

your collarbone i just want to close my eyes without thinking of others want to find the crook of a tree

and climb into it and sleep what a careful mind to know which wire to cut how did you know you

kept saying i don’t know i don’t know but you did right don’t shake you have to be a still bed for

me let me curl up as if you were a good grandfather i could hug i love the word ‘curl’ such a slow

word you can’t rush it

and hed railed at her his voice booming so loud the bed had seem to shake you canna do this  take my goddamned heart and then leave me you think i will no follow

she knew he was constantly there was aware of his movement and comprehended his words but she couldnt seem to open her heavy eyelids or speak

at night he would wrap his body around hers keeping her warm whispering against her hair you enjoy being contrary then prove them all wrong and get better hed clutched her hip then balled his fist there

you can’t live your life thinking death is going to come all the time you have to live life and if it comes then we can only hope we were able to do all the things we wanted he has to want to do something everyone does

these times of woe afford no time to woo

when you are in love everything is romantic

your neck i want to kiss it

the funny thing about destiny is that you cant predict it and you cant prevent it

tell me i said tell me when you notice me

i had this daft idea to come and bury the past except the past is not quite dead

its white

its so girly

this from a guy who named his poodle princess

his laughter died how do you know about princess

your sister told me

i wouldnt yell fire at that slimeball if his ass was in flames

i think you are inhuman if i leave you who will you go to would you find another lover

deny itdamn you

why is it women have to bring all this angst into sex we should be more like men in out over next

hey where are you going his voice confused yet curious called after me hey why didnt your mother name you maybe or well see or whatsyournumber that way we could call our first born absolutely

remember i told you i’ve taken a vow of chastity you understand what that means right

yeah he said you’re very generous i think that’s cool

i didn’t quite get his answer but i didn’t want to prolong the conversation

that’s when it dawned on me what greg had meant  um that’s charity greg not chastity

he is so not the right guy for me

they say money talks but all mine ever says is goodbye sucker

i celebrate it and relish the electricity of it with every fibre of my being

i can see no better reason for being alive

i know you inside and out sara i know you and i’ve accepted it all every bit of the crazy and i love you anyway remember

i always watch you you consume my every thought

we straighten  bu our snickering is barely contained as we attempt to focus our attention on a picture of a discarded coke can this guys lady love is kind of a slob dont you think he whispers

i cover my mouth with my hands again

stop it i hiss my eyes are watering ohmygod look at this one how did he get her toenail clippings

if you were my girl he whispers id take creepy pictures of your trash when i knew you werent looking

if you were my girl i whisper back id put the creepy pictures in a foreign museum so you wouldnt know that i take creepy pictures

sophie honey stop looking at me like that garrett said gruffly you’ll have me convinced i’m going to die

you’re not

good god you don’t give up

i laughed couldn’t help it and his

smile spread in response to the sound

i’m sure there are plenty of girls who

want to go out on a date with you

there are

wow modest aren’t you

why should i be he shot back

and i want to go out on a date with you

not them

it’s not so much where i want yousophie as it is how nothing tastes quite like a woman and no woman tastes like you  marc hunter

if i let you go are you going to hit me again

what do you think

then i’m not going to let you go

who’s there

the scratcher of your itch he said

she opened the door a crack and stuck her nose out was that supposed to be romantic

he swallowed and shifted his weight a little uneasily and then said very quietly his lips almost touching hers promise me youll marry me not now someday because i need to know

claier felt a flutter inside like a bird trying to fly and a ruch of heat that made her dizzy and something else something fragile as a soap bubble and just as beautiful joy in the middle of all this horror and heartbreak

yes she whispered back i promise

and she kissed him and kissed him and kissed him while the sun came up and bathed morganville in one last shining day

home was his favorite place too but home for him was anywhere jane happened to be never in his life had he loved someone as much as he loved her so much that it scared him sometimes

before i met you my life ran on sheer amusement

after i met you my life ran on sheer compassion

im ready for something private private and real

he hugged her hard i love you my life is so much better with you in it than out of it

her hand holding his for a dozen paces his resting on the small of her back for a moment touches that had no real purpose but to say i’m here and we are together still

i reached down and picked up a baseball bat at my feet and i flung it as hard as it could it circled and arced high in the air until it slammed against the side of the dining hall with a crack and fell

i sat down in the dirt then i lay down in the dirt

because not only was there no trail to follow there was no evidence he’d ever been here

there was no evidence any of them had been here

okay he said his breath hitching his hands shaking like hell as he pried her arms from around his neck and set her away

deep breath another okay justum okay christ christ darcy i want you so bad im afraid im going to hurt you

this is the us you wanted us to be gwen

i’d kill for you tess i have killed for you don’t undermine me by fearing others fear me let me rule you

sarah honey i hardly think kidnappers are going to take the time to buy a memento of their stay i could be wrong but it seems rather unlikely

no more sex

i blink several times at anna as we stand outside the car the next morning have we been married long enough for her to say that

it doesn’t hurt much i don’t know how it looks – he lowered his hand and turned his face to the side – but it can’t be that bad what do you think you’d date me right

alex pushed him away grinning you’re an idiot

i had come to the conclusion that everyone took sex far too seriously i mean its only sex

he needed to gather her up hold on to her anything to help her stop trembling something was going to shake loose if she didn’t

i stare at him you cant risk not winning not because of me

sean doesnt lift his eyes from the counter we make our move when you make yours you on the inside me on the outside corr can come from the middle of the pack hes done it before its one side you wont have to worry about

i say i will not be your weakness sean kendrick

now he looks at me he says very softly its late for that puck

some people come in your life and make you believe that your life is incomplete without them then they leave creating a void in your heart that may fill back with time but will never be complete

he put his hand on my waist and my heart began to pound a rougher rhythm than the music i held my skirt our free hands met his felt warm and comforting and unsettling and bewilderingall at once

there was a dull pang of regret because it was not the kiss of love which had inflamed her because it was not love which had held this cup of life to her lips

does he tell you that you’re all

he thinks about does he tell you that he lives for you

that he breathes for you that he dreams of you every

damn moment awake and asleep does he tell you any

of that’ he pauses to look at me and i try to keep a blank

face ‘no i didn’t think so’ he says quietly

womensighing and salivatingover his magnificent physique maybe the brutal bedding had destroyed a part of her brain

yes and when a rake finally falls he falls forever

the price of love is always just above that what your heart can afford

being heartbroken doesn’t mean you stop feeling just the opposite — it means you feel it all more

with your heart in fragments every sensation is sharper every emotion more acute your feelings are enhanced like a blind man with an impeccable sense of smell or a deaf woman whose eyes can perceive things a normal person would never recognize

the brokenhearted are the best empaths of all

he’s more myself than i am

so it’s fate then i asked with him so close my lips brushed the line of his jaw with each word us being together

absolutely calvin said with a low growl then he lifted my chin tilting my head back and kissed me deeply

who was i to argue with fate

i started to kiss him back slower and clumsy where his had been sure practiced i was worried i was doing it wrong but then a deep sound came from him almost a growl and instinctively i

knew it was a sound of approval

he pointed a shaking finger at her you he growled

she jerked glances over both of her shoulders looking for the unfortunate you he was addressing her holy shite this madman had settled on her

he was sound asleep his long legs stretched out in front of him the blessed fire blazing an empty bottle of wine by his side he hadnt been shaved recently and he looked rumpled dissolute and beautiful like

a fallen angel she moved to stand in front of him and pointed the pistol directly at his heart

i wouldnt do that if i were you he murmured and then he opened his extraordinary eyes its always

unwise to shoot the man youre in love with

im in love with you

finally the girl looks at me what

i dont know i gesture to the house the yard the dirt surrounding us im not sure what suggested romance maybe it was the screaming match or the way my girlfriend kicked my ass to the ground but i love you

i dont want you to say it back now one of us should have some class

lori sat way back in her chair and gave him the onceover what in the worlds gotten into ben lawson jokes flirting maybe i should sleep with molly i think shes got a magic hooha

i knew i couldn’t trust my illogical heart and that meant i had to do everything in my power to stay away from him so i wouldn’t have to

i don’t think i’ve ever referred to any girl i dated as my girlfriend i think that would freak me out even the girl that i dated for two years in college i don’t think i ever referred to her as my girlfriend

how would you introduce her i asked

i’m just going to say her name he said

be careful with my fiancée i love her more than life itself

nickyou make me all fluttery no one has ever made me fluttery how do you that

ridiculously pleased he smiled what can i say its magic take care babe

he was the most ordinary man in all the world and yet in her memory hed become luminous like the prince in a fairy tale

anne look here can’t we be good friends

you’re my woman of course

i’m responsible for you it’s my highest duty in life to take care of you protect you jason dorsey

i am the highway and a peregrine and all the sails that ever went to sea

my mate is really really weird

she is also absolutely covered in brown mushy clay

she laughs and holds a large lump up to show it to me her mouth moves and she makes enough noise to scare away a group of birds near the shore

she is so so strange

i cant bring myself to trust you but even if you were to betray me and even if you were to become my enemy would it be okay for me to love could you let me love you

marriages maybe made in heaven but a lot of the details have to be worked out here on earth

ive just vowed my love for you have you nothing to say in return duncan asked

thank you husband

dain kept his gaze on his plate and concentrated on swallowing the morsel hed just very nearly choked on she was possessive about him

the beautiful mad creature  or blind and deaf creature or whatever she was  coolly announced it as one might say pass the salt cellar without the smallest awareness that the earth had just tilted on its axis

so we’re going to take this road he murmured and see where it leads

now that ive found you it scares me witless to think of anything happening to you im not used to being afraid a sudden realization came to her so this is love she said quietly the daily prospect of joy or disaster

you take my heart with you my loving captor

nay madelyne i am your captive in body and soul

i suppose ill say it all started with a love letter

and givin yourself to me can never be wrong

my whole life i though i was the star of an overly earnest romance movie and it turns out i was in a goddamned buddy comedy all along

see what love does it makes you weak kills you

warm breath feathered over her scalp as remy pressed a gentle kiss to the top of her head it also gives people something to live for he whispered

heres the deal i get to marry you you get to become a garrett  although considering what youre marrying into im not certain thats much of an incentive

dallas to amy

hey shayne said through the door you going to stay in there all night because we’re getting tired of trying to eavesdrop from out here can’t hear a damn thing

all masculine hardbodied and sensual he was a deadly weapon sent by the gods to drive women mad and a walking billboard for all things wicked and carnal orgasms get your orgasms here hot and juicy just how you like ‘em

she flew into his arms held on tight as he swung her off her feet and hugged her so hard it hurt she didnt care she didnt want him to ever let go

when you can be this why are you ever anything else  broken verses

not even a repeat of dawson’s creek makes me feel better

ive crossed a world of sand and tears in search of you

she didn’t sound overjoyed she didn’t sound even slightly joyed

i want to be part of your story i want your story to rearrange the symbols in my mind i want your voice to be my voice

you dont think im going to deflower you under your fathers roof do you

put me down i’m too heavy

you’re small enough to fit in my pocket

to the beginning of the rest of our lives

alpha bitches are all the same underneath dont know how to give an inch even if their damn fool lives depend on it

she tastes like every dark thought ive ever had

and then i turned and saw a guy staring at me

what are you looking at idiot i asked giving him the sneer that had served me so well

my future wife the mother of my children

love is supposed to be based on trust and trust on love its something rare and beautiful when people can confide in each other without fearing what the other person will think

your life is a book make it a bestseller

careful he smiled im lethal

would you favor me with a dance over all the others i was his choice i curtsied and he took my hand our hands knew each other char looked at me startled have we met before lady

well she finally said he’s coming back shortly so you are absolved of your responsibilities

no the word came from him like an oath emerging from the very core of his being

she looked at him in impatient confusion what do you mean

he stepped forward he wasn’t sure what he was doing he knew only that he couldn’t stop i mean no i don’t want to be absolved

her lips parted he took another step his heart was pounding and something within him had gone hot and greedy and if there was anything in the world besides her besides him—he did not know it

i want you he said the words blunt and almost harsh but absolutely indelibly true

i want you he said again and he reached out and took her hand i want you

i want to kiss you he said and he touched one finger to her lips i want to hold you

and then because he couldn’t have kept it inside for one second longer he said i burn for you

he loved her

you teach people how to treat you by what you accept

its all life is just going round kissing people

i am an equation that only she solves these xs and ys by other names called my way of division is desperatley flawed while i multiply days without her

and baby the way you move me its crazy

i live my life until i start the cycle of my dreamsthen i leave and search for you until i diewhen i come backi live to rememberi live to find you

he can’t take his eyes off the stars but i can’t take mine off his face i can see the stars reflected in his eyes can see the wonder of it in the way his mouth opens but no sound comes out his eyes his face—they’re beautiful

im doing what ive always done loving you and hoping youll be brave enough to love me back

you arent even angry with me anymore stefan so let me up

to love someone so deeply is to risk losing yourself forever once i admitted my feelings to him there was no going back—no hope to ever make my heart complete without him

there are definite advantages to single beds he sat up abruptly and arranged her legs around his waist makes cuddling mandatory

she is by my side as my sister but he is my soul

he is my enemy my tormentor my demon

he is my beloved

he’d done it like he did everything else—with passion and total disregard for how much it might embarrass her

he is both the source of my happiness and the one i want to share it with

i have to believe that’s a sign

in the past year i’ve learned that love can make you do crazy silly stupid ridiculous things and the fact that one person can make you feel this way and do those things is amazing to me

he should probably make love to her

the cycle of true love first i see and think i love then i say i know i love today and forever more i decide to love

real is not dreams dreams are not real

unless you find the fine lineand erase it

love enters later in life through the cracks left by the first heartbreak

most lasses like it when a man kills the bugs along with reaching high places and giving sexual pleasure its one of the few universally popular qualities we have on offer

listen i know everything youre saying is true ellie does need a good man she needs someone steady someone who can offer her a life full of love and securityunfortunately she wants me

he wanted to paddle her himself then shake her then sit her down in a chair and explain to her why she must never ever get herself in a situation where she could be shot at again—and then throw himself at her feet

if you ever need to confirm that a girl is worth coming back from hell for show her your monster arm and see what she says

romance is the sweetening of the soul

with fragrance offered by the stricken heart

when you can’t reach the standards of another’s heart you must ask yourself

what value do i put on my soul that i would subject myself to such rejection

i was trying to get over you and it didn’t work i was meant to walk on this earth with only you i was meant to give only you every piece of me i don’t want anyone but you i love you

you picked the wrong girl to dominate dracula

i comfort myself with the reflection that your wife will possibly be able to curb your desirei admit a natural one for the most partto exterminate your fellows

if you cant see the good man he is you need to unscrew them eyeballs of yours and try on a different pair

i know the rules ive been living here longer than you have

he cracks a smile then he nudges me back hardly

city slicker he says rolling over on top of me and then kisses me everything dissolves heat explosions of color floating

through their kisses and caresses they experienced a joy and wonder the equal of which has never been known or heard of but i shall be silent for the rarest and most delectable pleasures are those which are hinted at but never told

i have a question for you if your shadow is the second most beautiful thing in the world which is the first

returning my voice to a conversational level i called back nora i’m not

attempting to embarrass you or single you out i know you’re capable but stay behind chas okay you die you d i e permanently and for various reasons that we’ve already gotten angsty about together i don’t want that to happen

okay okay she sighed

yes later with that i waved the team forward

you ride well but you dont kiss nicely at all

the man irritated her just like a rash

you may marry miss grey for her fifteen pounds but you will always be my willoughby my nightmare my sorrow my past my mistake my regret my love

were going anne said firmly

so soon percy pleaded but stars come out at night

then they fade at dawn anne replied this star needs to veil herself in darkness

this isnt your world its your parents your world is still out there waiting to be discovered always remember that

you try spending six months sitting at somebodys bedside waiting for them to die and then tell me that the happyending love story isnt one of gods good gifts

davidyou’re my true love why did we wait so long to get together i don’t care what the world says let’s defy them all my darling

okay first of all i didn’t sleep with you to make amends i slept with you because i wanted to

he still didn’t say anything and she pointed at him again and you know what it was your own damn fault it was those jeans you wear and the tool belt it was the size of your hammer

we shouldnt be doing this dan broke the silence his voice low we would both get in trouble he stood up lets go back

we shouldnt be doing what i scrambled to my feet what exactly are we doing

this

you mean consorting

sure consorting cavorting carousing he paused to take a deep breath

kissing then he leaned in and pressed his mouth to mine

i open my eyes

i want to know

what is in the abyss of a kiss

are stars born in these black caves

that house bated breaths and unspoken words

do our souls crawl on these tender cheeks

to greet one another by ivory gates

what happens when we kiss

where do you go

don’t tell me

for i have lost my desire to know

so that i forget myself

i close my eyes

and fall in the abyss

even if you fall on the runway i wouldnt blame you it would mean that we made a mistake in choosing you

no pain could match the emptiness of separation no agony rivaled the unreality of not being with her

i want you to want me the way i want you i want you to come to me and tell me that then i want you to show me it’s true

duke kylemore to verity ashton

maybe i was in love with the idea of love

he will one day meet his true love a fellow traveler on the road her eyes will be his ocean in her ocean he will sail forever

gentle he would be denied he would not

but i talk to you as i talk to my own soul he said turning me to face him he reached up and cupped my cheek fingers light on my temple

and sassenach he whispered your face is my heart

i saw wild dangerous beauty i saw devotion i saw you

my heart had been touched by him battered by him cradled by him as the days passed he was cruel without meaning to be yet he was kind and i needed him too much to let myself want him

every bride is beautiful it’s like newborn babies or puppies they can’t help it

nothing in my life would mean anything if you werent here to share it thered be no reason to get up in the morning without you to light the sun with your smile

i dont function without a heart he said angrily and then

added under his breath as he grabbed at the front of his tshirt

hes right here

sex might satisfy food might fuel love might sustain but without coffee what is the point

i felt tears prick my eyes as i looked down at the model again looking at that girl and boy on the curb forever in that place together

all beautiful distractions ignites from you

love me like saturday night like three glasses of champagne like the room is spinning like youre drunk on my love

don’t tell me your name it’s likely to awaken my conscience and that’s the last thing we want

she put down her fork why would you do that

because its efficient

not as efficient as having powers handle her own introductions youre paying her a fortune to do exactly that

id rather have you

her pulse kicked why

he gave her the melty smile he must have been practicing since the cradle one that made her feel as though she was the only woman in the world because youre easier to bully do we have a deal or not

you dont want a matchmaker you want a lackey

basically you expect me to find your bride court her and hand her over at the altar or do i have to come on the honeymoon too

definitely not he gave her a lazy smile i can take care of that all by myself

he loved her all he could but he couldnt love her very much

you love me

he kept gazing upward his answer coming softly yeah i do

i’m in love with you and i’m not in the

to dust and i know the sun will swallow

the only earth we’ll ever have and i am

in love with you

its just the end of some things

and the beginning of others

jake became excruciatingly aware of her there right behind him the small grunts and groans as she placed each foot carefully on the slick ground reverberated in his gut he wanted to turn around and tell her to shut the hell up

she sounded as though she was having sex

go to bed he ordered go to bed and stay there

if it comes to that retorted frederica with spirit  i am continually shocked by the

things you dont scruple to say to mecousin you are quite abominable

he sighed alas i know it the reflection gives me sleepless nights

you are correct in saying that desires often come from things we cannot easily gain  mine being that of your love by all accounts i do wish i could steal it but i am not that sort of man i will wait forever and a dayi will wait

stay here with me trishy don’t go back to your old life make a new one here with me i know it’s a hell of a big thing i’m asking—but i’m asking stay

silly of me not to have realized it one often finds greek temples lurking in the woods of english estates sneaky things temples

fairy tales just a fancy word for lies

after  years of marriage isn’t it amazing when you can look at your partner sound asleep next to you and still believe they have potential

hawke he said thats the word you need to be saying

give me agony or give me death

ill take thy heart as eternal breath

it seemed as if some subtle current of recognition had passed between them not as if they had met before but as if they had come close several times until finally an impatient fate had forced their paths to intersect

if you do not apologize to lady honoria marcus said his voice so mild as to be terrifying i will kill you

there was a collective gasp and daisy faked a swoon sliding elegantly into iris who promptly stepped aside and let her hit the floor

oh come now mr grimston said surely it won’t come to pistols at dawn

i’m not talking about a duel marcus said i mean i will kill you right here

saying youre through with romance is like saying youre done with living betty life is better with a little romance you know

i never knew what it was to crave a woman’s touch or to hunger for a woman’s kiss

and now you do she asked hesitantly

since i met you corinne bishop i’ve been thinking of little else

youre taller than i am but im stronger and meaner right this minute than you could ever imagine  lady madelyne

is there something wrong he asked

she gave a short negative motion with her head and then words so sweet like a cool northern breeze blowing off the lake you could hold me now

it was almost his undoing

look grace said how strange in spite of the rain you can still see the stars how bright they are tonight she pointed but lorcan didnt look his eyes remained fixed intently on her

i cant think of a finer sight in the whole world than the one im looking at right now he said

in spite of being drenched grace flushed at his words

lorcans eyes sparkled at her brighter than ever before

im a big believer in first impressions he finally said tell me what your first thought was when jason walked into the courtroom

taylor took a sip of her drink and grinned this one was easy i vowed to hate him forever

jeremys brown eyes twinkled at this thats exactly what i said nineteen years ago five minutes after he first walked into our dorm room

incredibly breakable you are i can never never afford to lose any kind of control when im with you

it is not easy to learn much about love but one thing i discovered that lady harleigh taught me it is not whom you love that is important but only that we love

i love you too will blakelee she whispered leaning in to kiss him again

savannah i’ve been talking my ass off for more than an hour now telling you shit no one’s ever heard anything about hoping that i’ll say something jesus god anything that will convince you to have sex with me

apparently having your girlfriend get shot in the head and life flighted away takes its toll on a guy imagine that i told him it was no biggie but he’s been kind of edgy about it

that was    i trailed off trying to find the proper adjective

long overdue you’re the one who got skittish when i mentioned how i felt and backed away when we almost kissed

you call me on all my crap don’t you he laughed throwing his head back that’s one of the things i love about you he said his fingers

skimmed up my shoulders until they cradled my neck and my whole body tingling

wouldn’t you rather play chess ma’amit’s less destructive of clothes

were all the same in the dark

love is not about lovers

the man in b wondered if he could have your autograph he told me his daughter is a huge fan

fan what the hell dylan lifted himself up and looked over the back of his seat since when did covert operators have fans

its the snickers bars snickers equal romance

it wasnt as if she was terrified of heights she simply preferred to be closer to solid ground where words like plummet and plunge did not linger in her mind

uncomfortablelord i’ve been doing the comfortable thing my whole life it seems like and what did it get me i think it’s about time i did something a little uncomfortable

this is what our love is––a sacred pattern of unbroken unity sewn flawlessly invisible inside all other images thoughts smells and sounds

i fell for her like a suicide from a bridge

fuck me i whispered giving him permission taking him into my flesh a soft invitation to madness

even before we met and long after were both gone my heart lives inside of yours im forever and ever in love with you

this should never have happened brishen we were unimportant you and i we werent supposed to mean anything to anyone

woman of day he said slowly you mean everything to me

all is as if the world did cease to exist the citys monuments go unseen its past unheard and its culture slowly fading in the dismal sea

i mean that star over there is blinking at me madly now but for how long an hour or two or for the next million years and how long will we sit here like this just another moment or the rest of our lives you know which one id prefer

your smile and your laughter lit my whole world

the minute im in a little pain  your rough tough scary bad boy image totally falls apart

if she were gone i would be nothing you should think better of yourself than to settle for that

you two were in a cave together’ said miss simpkins in horror

‘yes’ said kate ‘and it was very very dark

i love you baby girl when you’re sad i am too

long ago shed clamped an iron shell around her heart and nothing and no one could pry it lose but deep inside the tender flesh still beat

i’m well aware that this—that i—am the first man to ever do this to her and yes as a guy that

fact makes it even better

you know who neil armstrong is don’t you

now tell me who the second guy was hell tell me any other guy you know who made it to the

moon after him you can’t can you that’s why this is such a rush

she’ll never forget this

she’ll always remember…me

maybe that’s chauvinistic and egotistical but it’s the truth

then his beautiful lips touched hers a fluttering of wings a cry of angels a single beat of two hearts

i made the decision fifteen years ago that you were my life my everything you were with me in my dreams my dark lover my friend and confidant

i realize that even through the hard times i’m sure we’ll face i’ll never be able to walk away from her micha

semua orang pernah patah hati all you have to do is move on

i think sometimes the stars align whether we want them to or not and were drawn to certain people and places for no other reason thandestiny

now they are empty ramon replied with a shrug of broad muscled shoulders on his sixfootthreeinch framefor the first time a glint of humor touched ramon galverras finely sculpted mouth and arrogant dark eyes

it’s beyond your consciousness that your soul lingers with the person you love and hence your mood will affect the one you love this is the reason why you sometimes sense your mood changing mysteriously with no reason

he kept his eyes on mine his gaze unblinking and i stared right back into the blue he moved almost imperceptibly and in the space between a heartbeat his lips touched mine

ive sequenced the questions for maximum speed of elimination’ i explained ‘i believe i can eliminate most women in less than forty seconds then you can choose the topic of discussion for the remaining time’

‘but then it won’t matter’ said frances ‘i’ll have been eliminated’

‘only as a potential partner we may still be able to have an interesting discussion’

‘but i’ll have been eliminated’

i nodded ‘do you smoke’

‘occasionally’ she said

while he was the sun that lit your world you were the darkness that shadowed mine

what turns me on is not what i do to your body it is what i do to your mind

love is not maximum emotion love is maximum commitment

ralston looked down his long elegant nose at the vile creature at his feet and said you just impugned the honor of my future marchioness choose your seconds i will see you at dawn

leaving oxford sputtering on the ground ralston spun on one elegant heel to face benedick when i am done with him i am coming for your sister and if you intend to keep me from her you had better have an army at your side

draw a circle not a heart around the one you love because a heart can break but a circle goes on forever

i will have to admit though that i will never look at an apple in quite the same way

michael nodded tersely eyeing a table across the room it was empty so empty so joyfully blessedly empty

he could picture himself a very happy man at that table

not feeling very conversational this evening are we colin asked breaking into his admittedly tame fantasies

the love that we feel for each other is not about the worldly things those materialistic possessions or great looks either

he turned to her didn’t you see the lightning strike the steeple

she recovered with a sip of tea then smiled sweetly i was listening too devotedly to the sermon

claptrap last week lady d announced i think the priest is getting old

gareth opened his mouth but before he could say a word his grandmother’s cane swung around in a remarkably steady horizontal arc don’t she warned make a comment beginning with the words ‘coming from you…’

i wouldn’t dream of it he demurred

of course you would she stated you wouldn’t be my grandson if you wouldn’t she turned to hyacinth don’t you agree

to her credit hyacinth folded her hands in her lap and said surely there is no right answer to that question

smart girl lady d said approvingly

i learn from the master

sable hair bisected his pecs and arrowed down to the straight and unequivocal statement of his returned interest forcing my gaze to his face i said i really dont think we have time for that

you know that and i know that but he doesnt believe it

believe it i told him

jxs mouth tugged into one of those heartstopping smiles maybe you should whisper in his ear

love can cause problem and love can heal humanly problems based on our virtue

nobody with any real sense of humor can write a love story    shakespeare is the exception that proves the rule

finally mutually and completely they released all doubts abandoned all fears unwilling and unable to deny this overpowering love

would you believe i was in the neighborhood

no

well how about that i needed to see you

why did one of my neighbors call and say my cat’s been stalking their bunny

one corner of his mouth went up you know that sounds like a euphemism a kind of salacious one

ooh big words for mr average joe street cop she said knowing she sounded bitchy but unable to help it

can you take out the angry eyes mrs potato head and just let me talk to you

lucy i dont understand men

nettie what is there to understand if you feed em regularlike and give em a bit of sugar now and then theyre easy enough and if they dont behave you just toss em out on their arses thats what i always say

never mind that whats going on with you and heath

annabelle pulled a little wideeyed innocence out of her rusty bag of college acting skills

what do you mean business

dont give me that weve been friends too long

she switched to a furrowed brow hes my most important client you know how much this means to me

molly wasnt buying it ive seen the way you look at him like he was a slot machine with triple sevens tattooed on his forehead if you fall in love with him i swear ill never speak to

you again

he has a calculator for a heart molly said

i thought you liked him

mom nathan called to her

daisy pulled her gaze from the tent and the fleeting glimpse of jacks bare back the smooth planes and indent of his spine the sliver of the white elastic just above the blue waistband of his jeanshmm

whats a faaar ant he asked just above a whisper

fire she chuckled and shook her head fire ant they have a nasty bite that burns

nathan smiled well why didnt he just say fire

he thinks he did

he couldn’t just come right out with it could he no that would scare her off he had to be subtle build up to it explain himself

i love you

of course straight to the point was also an effective strategy

i dont think sleeping with you is going to solve anything she said stopping at the guest bedroom door

i dont really care what you think

sounds like you kids have some talking to do ill be eavesdropping from the kitchen

youre bruised as ugly as one of your cyclops and i can barely stand to look at you  duncan to madelyne

i know about safe sex nathan said interrupting jacks thoughts

jack swallowed thats good he smiled at his son vastly relieved that there would be no hard questions about his own sex life

what i want to know is nathan stole a quick look back at the tent where is the clitoris exactly

jacks smile fell and he opened his mouth no words came out so he closed it

nathan had no problem forming his words though and what the heck is a gspot

shed kicked kleins ass and still had enough moxie to tag him and enough physical strength to get herself out of a window ten feet up on the wall

he really should marry her

oh yeah how about mlin the cursed

will you love me enough

and i wake up happy baby because i possess beauty and i own that beauty in all the forms it can take and the least important of those are physical

no one can be a replacement for another person that is why farewells are always difficult

nothing can fill you up she stated

nope he agreed again

you won’t let it

barrel’s got a hole in the bottom buddy everything leaks out no matter how much you pour in

she was silent a moment then she whispered right

she turned to the door and his hand gripped his bourbon so hard he had to focus everything on loosening his grip or the glass would shatter

before she opened it she turned back you don’t know cal you have no idea

so full you’d be bursting

cal didn’t reply

joe she whispered you let me walk out this door you’ll lose your chance

cal didn’t move

there aint a man in the world cares about a womans past until hes thinking of her in his future

she looked at him his soft brown eyes and tall form and contemplated raising herself on her toes and kissing his ear or his cheek

instead impulsively before leaving she reached up and smoothed his mussed hair

often you don’t know whether you’re the hero of a romantic comedy or the villain on a lifetime special until the restraining order arrives

my boy

he is even

better than

fiction has nothing on you

uncomplicate it don’t make excuses some of life’s biggest heartaches come from missed opportunities and lame excuses don’t miss out on what could be the best chapter in your life because you’re too busy rereading the last one

love should feel like a hand sewn quilt made by grandma wrapping you up on a cold winter morning

his walk and stare was as poisonous as the air after a nuclear bomb

some guys are worth breaking the rules for

recent studies have shown that approximately  of authors are manic depressive the rest of us just drink

and third i was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him

are you threatening me he looked completely outraged at such a thing

you bet your incredibly attractive and probably hard enough to bounce a quarter off ass i am she snapped back

an indescribable look flitted across his face you are the most irreverent woman i’ve ever met

and you’re the handsomest man i’ve ever seen in my life but that doesn’t mean i’m going to lick you she yelled

regin the radiant and emmaline troy alrighty then have it your way youre on your own now if you come across a leech no offense remember your training

none taken and would that be the sword training where you fly past my defenses and swat me on the ass chirping dead another swat dead yeah ill get right on that

no that would be the training where you sprint like hell whenever you hear that im looking for you to train

if you could live anywhere in the world where would you live  right here  enzo replies in your arms

if you are lost i will find you if you are in danger i will protect you he said seriously its what a gentleman does elysse

alexi de warenne to elysse oneil

stung again by this queen bee of the loren clan marissa shook it off and retorted see that’s just it i don’t always love jack storm but with all my heart i love jack loren

mary approaches her before she is able to reach her station hello lily get anything special for christmas

just the usual she answers shattered dreams

you’re not terrified of me you’re terrified of letting yourself care for me and i can’t say i blame you people who love me usually end up dead but you see i’m not going to give you any choice you belong to me now whether you like it or not

i don’t like it not one bit

the weakness of a man is the strength of a woman

how can the most cruel and despicable create something as breathtaking beautiful as this

sometimes the only way to make your dreams come true is to shatter them

i am amazed at how being with him changes everything for me socially speaking

it was heaven forget angels forget st peter and glittering harpsichords heaven was a dance in the arms of ones true love

not that i knew who you were until last month but now that ive got you im not letting you go

youre not

blake stared at her in irritated confusion what was her game do you think im an idiot he spat out

no she said ive just escaped from a den of idiots so im well familiar with the breed and youre something else entirely i am however hoping youre not a terribly good shot

love isnt just a feeling love is a choice too and you may not be able to help your feelings but you are responsible for the choices you make about what to do with them

he’d stared into her eyes dark with confusion and unwilling passion and for one stark horrible instant he’d wished to be that different man he’d wished to be worthy of her

i love you i love you i love you always have probably always will happy she said

he stopped when he was standing mere inches away reaching out he captured her face in his hands and smoothed his thumbs across her cheekbones to clear her tears

you have no idea how relieved i am to hear you say that he said

some say that the age of chivalry is past that the spirit of romance is dead the age of chivalry is never past so long as there is a wrong left unredressed on earth

john brooke is acting dreadfully and meg likes it

my life was dark torture and empty before you found me you brought the light red i love you

the challenge is to pry bertie loose from dain and his circle of oafish dengenerates jessica said severely

it would be far more profitable to pry dain loose for yourself said her grandmother he is very wealthy his lineage is excellent he is young strong and healthy and you feel a powerful attraction

he isn’t husband material

what i have described is perfect husband material said her grandmother

i don’t want a husband

jessica no woman does who can regard men objectively and you have always been magnificently objective

oh how wonderfully romantic of you romantics are really only in love with themselves

what can i do he asked to start taking care of you

if ever there was something she needed to stick around and fight for luc was that something

is there somebody out there amy is that you her mother called

no tell me this isn’t happening quinn rested his forehead against hers has she got a wiretap on you or something i swear she’s like a walking hardon detector

amy bit her lip trying not to laugh quinn levered himself up on his arms

mrs p if you value your life you’ll go back inside and turn off the light right now

i guess the answer would be yes

got to love that word he kissed her so sweetly then it brought tears to her eyes got it in you to say it again

and then he did the unthinkable he went down on one knee

do you think she said instead of having sex we could make love

i’d love that ken whispered

she doesnt want the boy causing the distinction between love and in love

you haunt me you alone youre my fire im your air nathaniel to amelia

i came from thailand for you because mia said she could probably get you here id have come from zimbabwe outer mongolia or a prison in central america in truth i came through hell getting herebecause for me thats anywhere youre not

jenny you didnt leave

gareth of course i left i was hungry and i couldnt find anything to eat i bought a loaf and some cheese and oranges wait you mean you thought i had left without saying a word to you would i do that

gareth damn it you know better than most im no good at these things but even i am not that bad really jenny why would you believe such a thing of me

jenny i dont know maybe because you once told me all you wanted from me was a good shag

gareth i said that he looked surprised then contemplative then apparently he remembered and winced god i said that why did you even touch me

he understood that she needed some time to get used to them he didnt he knew exactly what was happening and he didnt need another week another month another year to get things in perspective

he loved her it was that plain that simple

ours is a love people write stories about

the insanity of love and that’s why you’re trying to drive away with the park brake on

if he was planning to attack and ravish he gave no indication of being in a hurry to do so

he pulled me toward him and all i could do was stand there with arms at my sides and head against his chest broken i feared even the slightest movement would cause pieces of me to snap off and fall to the gritty pavement

perhaps deep down inside that rugged shell of yours there is a little girl desperately waiting for her prince charming to propose

of course there is only until now id been pretty successful at keeping that little brats mouth shut

what will your answer be if he asks

youre funny he cant ask ill find a way to be bitchy enough for the next forty years so that perfect moment never comes

you seem to have a good handle on that little girl after all

without thinking he reached for her hand tucked it against her chest feeling that was where it should be perrys heart slammed against his ribs she had to feel it

there are many forms of love as there is moments in time and you are capable of feeling them all at different stages of your life

creativity is the catalyst to the future

i was naked under his gaze skin was just that skin but to see your soul stripped laid bare for the eyes of someone you barely knewthat was terrifying

if theres one common thread throughout all of history its that people have always fallen for the wrong people

was it just her or did lovers look more adoringly at each other in this city especially in the springtime

she sighed it wasnt their fault that they were bastards who should die

oh dios mio she makes me burn she makes me need she is etching herself into mi alma

romance is a tender kiss with a lingering promise of more to come

he nodded in agreement aye you usually say that and i still stay it’s our way

we do not remember days shemei we remember moments and the richness of life lies in memories we have forgotten

people dont care how smart woman is as long as shes charming and gay and pretty

he could feel her laughter against his chest and at that moment he thought that there was no better feeling than making emma morley laugh

what were you chanting when you gave me your blood

more of my vampire magic i cast a healing spell to aid the powers of my blood

she sniffled her nose stuffy it was better than vicodin

a painkiller from my world

a killer of pain did you love him the words were growleda burst of unexpected humor gave her strength no in fact he was hard to shake he uh stalked me that kind of thing i had to pretend he didn’t

nicolai kissed her temple and relaxed against her

baby where were going you wont need a shirt

this doesn’t mean anything haley whispers as she reaches up and pulls at the velcro of my glove

yes it does i bring my arms to my sides and the instant the gloves fall to the floor my hands latch on to that beautiful body tell me haley please tell me it does because this means something to me

i think love without heartbreak is a myth a pretty myth but the kind of myth that ultimately makes us feel worse about ourselves because were somehow not able to make it come true

gavin what’ll i wear home

cloak his voice roughened and he ripped harder tossing the material to the ground i felt his smile when he kissed my neck and shivers ran down my back at the sound of his low growl

i made that i don’t have many of those you know

it is no wonder lesbians love women

when a girl smiles shes as beautiful as a blooming flower

it was like being leaned on by a very heavy warm brick a sexy brick

we’re adults i might be a little more of an adult if you’re counting years but i bet i have a lower iq so that puts us pretty much even

she realised she was whimpering sir held her closer his hard grip reassuring this wasnt a dream he really was here

do you really think that i don’t have anything better to do than to spend my time thinking about you digging up a little of the goods on luc martineau

fine lines appeared at the corners of his eyes and he laughed sweetheart there is nothing little about luc’s goods

ben was in his truck window down idling at the curb dark lenses hiding his eyes from her looking effortlessly big and badass

the way she wished she felt

it occurred to her that all the bad parts of life the sad parts the frightening ones were meant to be offset by moments and memories like this she had to be present in it right here right now

so its over i guess they are in love or do they just think it huh

they stared at each other for several long minutes hoping the other would give in finally she broke fine will you go in with me then

will it make you feel better

someday my love youre going to understand just how much i care for you youre my light my warmth my other half i only feel alive when im with you i love you caine

i chose the path less traveled but only because i was lost carry a map  phoebe traeger

maybe we’ll admit this thing we have is perfect not worth messing around with and stay together forever if you’re interested that is

she glanced away i could think about that

he buried his face in her neck think fast

until meeting you i wasn’t looking for anything at all since meeting you i’m kind of looking for a girlfriend

youd think the very thought of a romance writer would bring a smile to peoples lips ah how nice love making love laughter kissing

but no the world is upside down as far as i can see and romances and their writers are ridiculed hisses and generally spat upon

honey if any woman thought a gorgeous hunk was going to rescue her romance novels wouldn’t be forty percent of the publishing industry

they call her love love love love love she is love and she is all i need

not break not hurt he murmured as he raised a hand to her cheek and smoothed his fingers down its softness but dominate you yes master you yes make you yield to what you want make you surrender to who you truly are yes

there is a big difference between having your heart broken and being the one responsible for a broken heart i was twelve years old and had already experienced both

its just me throwing myself at you

romance as usual us times us

not lust but moxibustion

to the body as possible

he was with me beside me inside me and i did not care that my children were asleep alone at home or that the neighbors might come to know he burned the fear out of me until all was left was desire

and who are you now she asked

a man hopelessly in love with you

i may be heavensent but im not perfect

majority of women like to fantasize and men like to romanticize i saw a painful mountain in her eyes

no im not a dream im your worst nightmare

i know you don’t like to believe you ever need to be taken care of but i can’t stand the idea of you being sick and alone i need to be here for you babe

if you want i can carry you—

i’m fine she said shortly let’s go

he’d said that wrong he should have said i want to carry you

there is no hope for the hopeless but there is always some love for the loveless

never give up never surrender

all those who love know exactly the limit theyre prepared to go to they know exactly what is required

amy sat back and grinned you just smiled that was definitely something else she could get used to

of course he frowned immediately i smile

terence as my old da used to tell me never trust a rich man

david good thing im only moderately rich

terence which is why i only moderately distrust you

that’s the last time i put you in charge of the tequila when we’re making margaritas

three denises wobbled in front of her all of them watching her with fond concern you’re a sweetie i appreciate you cheering me on from the sidelines but i think i need to go to the bathroom now and throw up

even the boy who cried wolf was right about the wolf once

an aphrodisiac will disappear

delusional like permanence or wealth

a shimmering as if love were a ghost

and yet my passion for you seethes and sears

without an end late april leaves can’t crave

caress of dew sunlight’s sweet splash more than

i pine for your embrace us turned to one

when harsh reversals scar the thought of you will salve

from your electric charms as all my moods

succumb to your sweet fire and perfect wit

now you are all i live for  loving you

in fleeting world of lies you are the truth

lean in to kiss me

in all the places

where the ache

the most special

quote is taken from chapter

you tread lightly through life but you leave deep footprints that are hard for other people to fill

it was the wildness of it that got me going the primal lust the sheer needs of two people in heat quickly finding ways to express their sacred hunger to each other in animal passion

sometimes there’s no cure for the crazy dale sighed stroking my hair i think we all just have to keep loving through it maybe that’s the cure

the thing i am most afraid of is love when you say you love someone you are giving them license to hurt you

there is no cosmetic to gain a beauty like yours

what does it mean flynn turns to gaze at me eyes finally meeting mine

i find myself smiling because i know exactly what it means it means the clouds are clearing on avon

i know you can take care of yourself he said with absolute certainty his vivid eyes probed hers with the same underlying resolve he lifted a hand and brushed her cheek with his fingertips i just dont think you shouldnt have to

you are the beautiful and elusive pinpoint of radiance that lit up the darkness and called me home

mens eyes were made to look let them gaze i will budge for no mans pleasure

but you… you have no fucking clue how unbelievably beautiful and desirable you are you’re not calculating and selfish and you make me want to be better woods

he laced his hands behind his neck and propped his boots on the opposite arm of the sofa if an artist were to capture this image it would have been labeledsmugness a portrait she wanted to shake him

far from a normalfunctioning relationship but normal has never been our thing

that their marriage lasted fewer than three days before they both were dead

didn’t seem to affect my fantasy even if they had lived i don’t think their

never stop believing that your dreams are eternal

psychological and emotional wellness is an ongoing process for everyone

i’m the guy who knows how you can hurt so much that your insides feel like they’re cut and bleeding

it is strange the reasons one feels he doesnt deserve things

on a ship thats made of paper i would sail the seven seas just to be with you

you wanna love me for the rest of your life

baby i’m gonna love you for the rest of my life harry says pressing a quick careful kiss to the corner of louis’ mouth i just hope that you want to be loved by me for the rest of your life

i love you he says still meeting harry’s eyes and it took me a while to get here but i think that maybe i’ve always loved you but you wanna know the other thing that i know for sure besides the fact that i love you

i’m always going to love you louis says tucking some of harry’s hair behind his ear no matter what

always go after the girl no matter what she says chase her

you are going jane

i am going sir

you are leaving me

you will not come you will not be my comforter my rescuer my deep love my wild woe my frantic prayer are all nothing to you

what unutterable pathos was in his voice how hard was it to reiterate firmly i am going

withdraw then i consent but remember you leave me here in anguish go up to your own room think over all i have said and jane cast a glance on my sufferings think of me

he turned away he threw himself on his face on the sofa oh jane my hope my love my life broke in anguish from his lips then came a deep strong sob

smile its the second best thing you can do with your lips

if the human heart sometimes finds moments of pause as it ascends the slopes of affection it rarely halts on the way down

am i your dom little rabbit

yes her redbrown brows drew together what’s wrong

not a thing he gave her a faint smile and his gravelly voice deepened i thought i’d tell you we’re getting married next month

nolan and beth

looking at him she saw her future and felt all the ragged tears in her heart heal themselves i fit she whispered in marvel stepping into him i fit with you

he nodded and wrapped his arms around her

he wants a fifteen thousand pound settlement

he says youre a great deal of trouble

she hesitated for one startled moment before choking back a laugh

i am

i thought so he leveled drew a look if i pay you the fifteen thousand do you swear to keep her

drew reared back his head forever

oh i suppose he gave a longsuffering sigh if i must

she bit the insides of her cheeks to keep from laughing outright

never be ruled by possessions and never ever make wealth more important to you than your selfrespect and your dignity  lady taylor

she was like a heroine in a novel that she herself was writing the character kept protesting that she was too strong for love and yet the narrator went on describing her desire

how about we give each other everything we can and not blame each other for what we can’t

maybe illusion and artifice—lies even—are a necessary part of romance

she hated mr meanie but shed gotten to know him and theyd reached an understanding of sorts now she was to have him for supper

dont tell me youre feeling guilty

breaking off a piece of the wing she brought it to her lips and took a bite it did taste good very good

i wonder if all grouchy males are this palatable

she looked up tilting her head

are you all right

he turned a dull red

eat your supper connie

i will find her

and when you do roger asked

i will make her mine the warrior answered in a hard determined voice she will be mine

the vow was made

the books we love offer a sketch of a whole universe that we secretly inhabit and in which we desire the other person to assume a role

what comes from the heart will go to the heart

every girl should have at least one wild fling on her resumé

he wasnt aware of it but when he smiled he looked like an amiable bear when he didnt smile he didnt look amiable

matt was almost completely naked a tattered loincloth and an ugly chain with a yellow diamond were his only apparel

a kiss is only as sweet as the heart that gives it

she had wanted more than she could have

she had wanted him and more she had wanted him to want her

in the name of something bigger than tradition bolder than reputation more important than a silly title

my knitting is simple he said again ï can make anything you want with it but it will always be simple

and your green eyes are the color of the hills the color of my home his voice dropped to a whisper aye theres something about you lindsey waters

dream big and never give up on those dreams who knows where theyll take you

honestly i dont understand the rousing of romance all that well i used to believe in this thing called fate or destiny a romantic romeo and juliet monet and veronica etc but now i feel jaded maybe agnostic to the idea

no haphazard circumstance no chance meetings where distant planets align its simply two rational individuals who make a choice and an effort to remain together

i dont know who he was kavita flatout states but whoever he was he sure did a number on you didnt he

mary leans forward to ensure he would see her deviant stare did it ever occur to you that maybe i did a number on him

kavita leans in closer as well and with that same deviant expression yes i have

lily looks back down at the necklace in her hand that kavita had given her it must have cost a fortune

it did he confirms though not nearly as much as youre worth

lily looks up at him dont say that you hurt me everytime you speak

the white lily stands for purity artists for centuries have pictured the angel gabriel coming to the virgin mary with a spray of lillies in his hand to announce that she is to be the mother of the turks

you know kavita begins i think i can pick out my own furniture i am an artist after all i do have some taste

no you dont nick plainly states no man has taste besides i didnt pick it out she did wives are good for things like that

i knew you read the symposium in the vac he said in a low voice

then you understand  without me saying more

how do you mean

durham could not wait people were all around them but with eyes that had gone intensely blue he whispered i love you

that dog is a wolf is he not

a small flash of hazel told him not to quibble

and yet he is thy boon companion a creature of rare courage and affection and altogether a worthy being

oh aye he said with more confidence he is

she gave him an even look

thee is a wolf too and i know it but thee is my wolf and best thee know that

hed started to burn when she spoke an ignition swift and fierce as the lighting of one of his cousins matches he put out his hand palm forward to her still cautious lest she too burst into flame

what i said to ye before    that i kent ye loved me

she stepped forward and pressed her palm to his her small cool fingers linking tight

what i say to thee now is that i do love thee and if thee hunts at night thee will come home

under the sycamore the dog yawned and laid his muzzle on his paws

and sleep at they feet ian whispered and gathered her in with his one good arm both of them blazing bright as day

it kept him alive he was certain even more it kept his darkest of his demons at bay

angel clicked on a few more pictures on the screen and alex made small talk about the place then he finally walked away he stopped just before walking out

did valerie say anything else to sarah

angel glanced back at him about what

you know about that guy she’s seeing

angel turned his attention back to the computer no not really

alex frowned he wasn’t one of those guys so he wasn’t about to keep asking if angel knew anything he’d tell him he’d just have to wait until the rehearsal dinner

he started back out when angel spoke up i’m not sure because she didn’t actually tell me but i overheard sarah on the phone last night it sounded like valerie was telling her about him

yeah what did you hear

angel looked up trying to remember something seemed to come to him but he hesitated i don’t think you wanna hear it alex i know i wouldn’t

alex squeezed the doorway with his hand what the hell could he have heard tell me

angel shook his head and looked back at the monitor only reason i caught my attentions was because i overheard sarah ask her something about wearing lingerie

love and ego can never exist together just as the sun and shadow cannot

her head jerked up besotted youre nothing like it vengeful is more like it spiteful

misha my best friend who got me into bed and fucked me with a lie

i dont know whether to toss you through that window or shake your hand and say well done henry said in a tired voice

or you just not ask her

you might as well slit my throat

he took in the squeaky music the vulgar and pining melodies because passion immobilizes good taste and seriously considers what soberly would be thought of as funny and to be resented

i want you to know chickens aren’t sexy not to me

this was met with silence

are you there she was slurring her words now which was embarrassing so she took a deep breath cam can you hear me

yes chickens aren’t sexy uh…i don’t think they’re meant to be

oh aye im the devil all right and last night you were begging to step into the fire

conn was a wickedly passionate fiercely dominant man who loved her too much to ever really hurt her

honest to god she was the noisiest woman hed ever been shot at with

constitutional democracy you see is no romantic notion its our defense against ourselves the one foe who might defeat us

that made love—not grace—the magic ingredient then a

new thought hit her perhaps love was grace a shiver went

up her spine what did that make anger the antithesis of

max  do me a favor if the constable comes knocking tell him i was here all morning will you

dodsley  killed someone again did we

max never before luncheon dodsley its still early yet

he loves her for everything she is and is not she’s old enough to appreciate that

jenny but surely lord blakely could not abandon his estates for so long

gareth no lord blakely could not not unless he had someone he could trust to run his estates in his absence and lord blakelywell lord blakely did not trust anyone

jenny lord blakely is talking about himself in the third person past tense its disturbing

my names sean jem im sean

suck on this edward

how my heart missed beating like this for him only for him

i think i love you bennett probably not relevant at the moment so no need to say thanks

amy listen to me what i do the choices i make theyre mine only mine the consequences of those decisions—mine

mine he repeated when she sighed heavily no one elses

silence only the warm wetness of her tears dampening his shirt

it broke his heart

what sort of look are you going for

damn how did he answer this something…normal he finally said

just leave me alone i want to be alone she said when jack tried to open the car door she hit the lock and wound the window up since the roof was down it was a fairly pointless exercise

he dropped his voice so low that tessa wasn’t sure if what he said next was real or part of the dream darkness rising to claim her though she

fought against it

i’ve never minded it he went on being lost that is i had always thought one could not be truly lost if one knew one’s own heart but i fear i may

be lost without knowing yours he closed his eyes as if he were boneweary and she saw how thin his eyelids were like parchment paper and

how tired he looked wo ai ni tessa he whispered wo bu xiang shi qu ni

she knew without knowing how she knew what the words meant

i love you

and i don’t want to lose you

it took me two years to give him all of my heart and he threw it away in one night

i looked at him like a stranger someone i’d never seen before and he looked at me like i’d been lost to him for a thousand years and finally found

just take my hand lead dance with meand i will simply follow the blueness of the water the white waves rolling freewhere the earth beneath my feet and stars make my heart whole againin long and priceless moments of shared solitude

it’s always funny watching something so beautiful not know how beautiful it really is it’s sad even

she was an exotic flower amongst the snowdrifts out of place a technicolor misfit in a monochrome christmas movie

see me just as i see you

he had taken george my beloved george from me and he had taken my other self anne

good luck oretsev find the firebird and when this is over ill see you well rewarded a farmhouse in udova a dacha near the city whatever you want

so he caught her in his arms and kissed her and they were very happy and told each other what a beautiful world it was and how wonderful it was that they should have found each other seeing that the world is not only beautiful but rather large

ah sweetie if the poets couldn’t unriddle them then you certainly can’t be kind and keep your ears on offer if she wants to talk but you can’t draw out the strangeness edgar it’s not a poison

brahma and airavata

brahma turned to saraswati

and gently kissed her inked hand

a mans weakness is a womans beautya womans weakness is falling in love

just tell me what you need to make you happy you

some people just don’t find their prince charming straight away they have to search for him

i’ve loved you probably from the first moment that i met you and i will love you until my last breath leaves i fell in love with you the first time you smiled at me and only

i think he could handle being used it would be good for him hes having trouble sleeping

i saw thee onceonce onlyyears ago

i must not say how manybut not many

it was a july midnight and from out

a fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring

sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven

there fell a silverysilken veil of light

with quietude and sultriness and slumber

upon the upturnd faces of a thousand

roses that grew in an enchanted garden

where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe

fell on the upturnd faces of these roses

that gave out in return for the lovelight

thier odorous souls in an ecstatic death

fell on the upturnd faces of these roses

that smiled and died in this parterre enchanted by thee by the poetry of thy prescence

clad all in white upon a violet bank

i saw thee half reclining while the moon

fell on the upturnd faces of the roses

and on thine own upturndalas in sorrow

was it not fate that on this july midnight

was it not fate whose name is also sorrow

that bade me pause before that gardengate

to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses

no footstep stirred the hated world all slept

save only thee and me oh heaven oh god how my heart beats in coupling those two worlds

save only thee and me i paused i looked

and in an instant all things disappeared

ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted

the pearly lustre of the moon went out

the mossy banks and the meandering paths

the happy flowers and the repining trees

were seen no more the very roses odors

died in the arms of the adoring airs

all all expired save thee save less than thou

save only the divine light in thine eyes

save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes

i saw but them they were the world to me

i saw but them saw only them for hours

saw only them until the moon went down

what wild hearthistories seemed to lie enwritten

upon those crystalline celestial spheres

how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope

how silently serene a sea of pride

how daring an ambitionyet how deep

how fathomless a capacity for love

but now at length dear dian sank from sight

into western couch of thundercloud

and thou a ghost amid the entombing trees

didst glide away only thine eyes remained

they would not go they never yet have gone

lighting my lonely pathway home that night

they have not left me as my hopes have since

they follow me they lead me through the years

they are my ministers yet i thier slave

thier office is to illumine and enkindle

my duty to be saved by thier bright light

and purified in thier electric fire

and sanctified in thier elysian fire

they fill my soul with beauty which is hope

and are far up in heaven the stars i kneel to

in the sad silent watches of my night

while even in the meridian glare of day

i see them still two sweetly scintillant

venuses unextinguished by the sun

fantasy is not practice for what is real—fantasy is the opiate of women

ah damn it lasshe called after her ive busted my stitches wide open

whatshe cried hurrying back to him let me see

ahha he snared her around the waist dragging her down with him to his lapyou still care for me

he stalked up behind her to clench her hips and she stilled

in a breathy voice she asked youre going to make love to me again arent you

in answerhe lifted her onto the counter tore off her shift then pressed her naked body back into the blooms

above all she wanted to look as though she had not given the matter a moments thought and that would take time

you came here a fighter maddie maybe youd lost a round or two but you were on your feet you want to stay in lucky harbor fight for it you want a relationship with your sisters fight for it

what about you what about a relationship with you

he pulled back to look into her face as if memorizing her features his voice when he spoke was low and gravelly with emotion im already yours always have been all you have to do is step into the ring

you are always looking at people like this and then she made a face one he couldn’t possibly begin to describe

if i ever look like that he said dryly precisely like that to be more precise i give you leave to shoot me

youll do fine

what youre psychic now

didnt you know he asks seriously must be an aftereffect of the bond

scent is the strongest tie to memory

do you want to fix it

i just said i was in love with her why wouldnt i want to fix it

you want to know how

goddamn it del he drank again yes since youre so fucking smart how do i fix it

jack blew out a breath i can do that

because you have only known me for like fourteen seconds and seven of those were us making out and you still know more about me than all of my friends in this stupid place

you totally love him hes your widdle snookums

you ever had a hickey i want to give you a hickey

karl were not fourteen

dont bloody care i was in love with you when i was fourteen  your neck owes me a hickey

we’re more than common rock he murmured we’re pretty nigh indestructible when we’re in our stone forms

i thought this over then why didn’t they pick you up and throw you into the sea

he sent me a dark look you’re a bloodthirsty lass aren’t you

you are my one and only for all eternity

just one look and then i knew that all i longed for long ago was you

usually i’d sit back and just enjoy the view for what it was because it’s not often you come across something so ridiculously out of place a girl like you on the subway it’s like spotting a unicorn at the zoo

i reasoned how to pull this off to get you to say hi to ask your name what your voice sounded like if you had a cute smile because i like cute smiles in ten minutes i had a thousand thoughts of you and you had no clue

love doesnt always mean rings and veils and walks down the aisle

sometimes love means broken windows and broken hearts

and not being able to fix either

and sometimes love means telling you

theres no such thing as time in heaven so dont rush to meet me

stay a while and pick girl the roses

no one messes me around i dont give second chances and i never waste tears over people who arent worth it i save them for the people who are

life is a book we fill the pages

doesnt look like its doing wonders for yours

saints be praised it can actually be rewarding

looking over his shoulder he halted in the middle of the room irish

i beg your pardon

you irish the green eyes the tiny bit of red in your hair is connor your real name

yes why she said stammering bloody hell of course

she felt the slow hot roll of color cross her cheeks what could that possibly have to do with anything

samira’s guards are coming for you you’re being summoned didn’t you hear the horn come on they’ll be here any second looking for you

i bit my lip to hold back a smile of my own at why we hadn’t heard the horn

i dont think two people could have been happier than we have been

where love is great the littlest doubts are fear where little fears grow great great love grows there

it would ha been a good deal easier if yed only been a witch

ive fallen in love with you i love you even now when you sit before me with the eyes of a wolf so take pity upon the fool i have become i forgot it was only a bargain between us

you want more she asked a bit breathlessly even after what we did

his mouth took on a sardonic twist im afraid quantity usually matters for me

the princesss assassins

all romantic novels end the same way but its the process of getting there that provides all the enjoyment

he’d spent the night in the boat next to the spaghetti queen

william glanced at the hobo girl she sat across from him huddled in a clump her stench had gotten worse overnight probably from the dampness another night like the last one and he might snap and dunk her into that river just to clear the air

she saw him looking dark eyes regarded him with slight scorn

william leaned forward and pointed at the river i don’t know why you rolled in spaghetti sauce he said in a confidential voice i don’t really care but that water over there won’t hurt you try washing it off

she stuck her tongue out

maybe after you’re clean he said

her eyes widened she stared at him for a long moment a little crazy spark lit up in her dark irises she raised her finger licked it and rubbed some dirt off her forehead

now what

the girl showed him her stained finger and reached toward him slowly aiming for his face

no william said bad hobo

the finger kept coming closer

after a moment he found my neck kissing the nape his teeth grazing my skin and causing

me to make a small noise very much like a whimper before i could take another breath his

lips met mine and i was lost to his touch

forgive me for being the stupidest man on the planet

careful you’re talking about the man i love

its a good thing youre an aging orphan he murmured gently pushing the hair away from her face i dont have to wait around to get anyones permission

permission for what you rat bastard she said

such language dragon im afraid youre going to have to marry me

gradually we have become each others weather

i hate to tell you dragon but thats an integral part of the whole usiness he whispered if youre afraid to touch me then were not going to get very far

she lifted her head to look at him i thought i could lie back and let you ravish me she said with complete honesty

he shook his head the smile hovering around his lips his eyes intent this is a cooperative effort my love you have to do your part

to her surprise lucky tilted his head and looked her in the eye appearing oddly…crestfallen she thought don’t be nervous he said i hate making you nervous

my god he pushed away from the bedpost friends and do you fall into bed with any man whos dear to you how am i to take that

of course i dont she stood up letting the knotted scarf slip away i cant seem to help myself with you about that its extremely vexing

of course not i knew you would protect me you swore that you were strong enough to protect vivienne didn’t you how can you promise to protect my sister but not trust yourself to keep me safe

you’re staring at my ass

yes i am it’s what he did in the mornings when she woke up and spent the first hour lying around in bed

its true i live on hope why shouldnt i every day i see her beauty while you rot in hell you will tell me that im deluded but we are all deluded in some way the question is which is the best delusion

youve experienced the single scene out there  its blood test and background checks and references and please pee in this cup before we can go on a date screenings all clinical and stripped bare of any romance

for thy sweet love remembrd such wealth brings

that then i scorn to change my state with kings

excuse me your attention please

he waited until the whole floor had stopped what it was doing and turned to face him for a split second his impulse control kicked in but by then his mouth was fully engaged

for the record claire marsden and i are not having sex

her unusual upbringing had made her worldly enough to understand that every female no matter her genus and species had the ability to physically coerce a male into full cooperation

and yes she knew just the male to coerce

don’t freak out i’m getting into the bed he said

sadly however the sight of her generous d cups no longer sparked an ounce of interest from little sam the man in charge of social activities

kas was right a woman could destroy a man this one could do so simply by knowing his name she could do so simply with her eyes

if you do not love me i shall not be loved

if i do not love you i shall not love

lips that have tasted the salt of tears always give the sweetest kiss

how is it that you always know the exact right stupid romance novel thing to say i asked leaning up to kiss him

he smiled against my lips when i pulled back he said i was a student of shakespeare before the romance novel was even dreamt be glad i do not leave you horrible poetry on your pillow wrapped securely around the bodies of dead rats

as for the piano the faster her fingers flew over it the more he marveled she struck the keys with aplomb and ran from one end of the keyboard to the other without a stop

new hair new clothesthe classic relationship breakup makeover jake said

delaney stared at him for a beat in a way he was right she was breaking up with sam he just didnt know it

that replied lord vaughn is exactly what i mean has anyone ever told you that you haggle divinely that the simple beauty of your selfinterest is enough to bring a man to his knees

mary couldnt in honesty say that anyone had

the truest poetry is the most feigning mary quoted back his own words to him

and the most feigning is the most true

i like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while even if theyre only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something

i didnt want to be the woman who gave herself over willingly to the first man to notice her i didnt want to be the stupid girl in every novel who loved without question and entered relationships that didnt make sense

love is total surrender total acceptance and total commitment

but what was wrong with the performance she asked i thought it was wonderful

dont you remember i said the record we used to listen to at the end of the second movement there was this tiny scratch you could hear putchi putchi somehow without that scratch i cant get into the music

shimamoto laughed i wouldnt exactly call that art appreciation

this has nothing to do with art let a bald vulture eat that up for all i care i dont care what anybody says i like that scratch

maybe youre right she admitted but whats this about a bald vulture regular vultures i know aboutthey eat corpses but bald vultures

youre a strange one she laughed and there in the train seat ever so slightly she moved her shoulder to touch mine the one and only time in the past two months our bodies touched

i wish you were the one who had heard of the rule silence is golden he said

he has the body of a professional athlete chiseled to perfection in all the right places

marriage is not kickboxing its salsa dancing

mark ran his fingers over the bindings and

whispered words written long ago words that

wriggled through the aged leather trembled

beneath his touch what lives and loves

hopes and dreams deaths and despair

these volumes held

i love you mark courtney por

i love you too courtney mark por

i know every guy here and they’re all pretty much jerks

his lordship and i areopposite sides of very different coins

speechless and very nearly panting she fell back against the wall with a thump knowing that if she lived to be ninety she would still carry the searing mark of that kiss on her soul

at last he murmured a way to shut you up christovao santos chris sanctuary

lady ponsonby was right the forbidden fruit isnt shaped like an apple its shaped like a banana

his hope wasnt lost it was buried and somehow prudence ryland made that old grave seem much more shallow than it once was

i make a show of smoothing down my hair – a lost cause at this point ah that it’s getting to the stage where it deserved a name the knotted nest the twisted tresses

what about the terrible tangle

i nod that has serious possibilities

the matted mess he suggests

love me lessbut love me for a long time

i have romanticised you to the point where the knives you pressed into my skin began to look like cupids arrows

you keep showing up here being who you are there was a pause im going to fall in love with you rehvenge

…she needed him to know she did not care she was spirited tenacious and full of contempt for him

the world is dyed with the color of blood it will never be able to go back to the way it was before

a hint of sensual frustration roughened his voice

and i will curse the gods along with them min some wild monsoon raged through me as i looked at you just now it’s left me rearranged inside and i don’t have a map

so please just let me be egocentric and ask you to stay

i’ve shared more breakfasts with you than

any woman i’ve dated in the last year and a half mitch returned

i know what you look like in the morning i know what you act like

when you come home tired after work i know that you pick the least

expensive thing on the menu either to be nice or to be annoying in

order to put me off but i think it’s to be nice because you

are nice and also both times you thought you’d be spending

time with just me you dressed in a way that would not in any way

put me off i know you cuddle when you’re sleeping i know you take

only milk in your coffee and you make coffee strong i know you’re

really good with kids and i know that you use music and scents to

regulate your mood so i’m thinking this is not a first date this

is more like us hittin’ the six month mark and the six month mark

is when you stop talkin’ about shit that really doesn’t matter and

start talkin’ about shit that means everything

you cannot mistake this

you cannot reinvent this moment

you cannot call this love

it is so much more

there are certain kinds of silence that make you walk on air

i laughed as we turned in a tight circle tonight youre all mine

jake smiled but looked me dead in the eye no from now on

my heart skipped what

yours he said simply from now on

i got a head start and ws already hanging upside down when he caught up all the blood was rushing to my head making me feel dizzy i cant stay like this much longer i told himhead rush

he leaned down and stuck his face next to mine gifting me with a beautiful smilei know the feeling he said you give me a head rush all the time

they filled our world with weapons aimed at foreheads and smiled as they shot  candles right through our future they killed those strong enough to fight back and locked up the freaks who failed to live up to their utopian expectations

my hope my heaven my trust must be

my gentle guide in following thee

i’ve never heard a girl say a diamond was too big

i just think when they get too big they look fake

he leans down i say the same thing about breasts

when i am lonely for boys what i miss is their bodies the smell of their skin its saltiness the rough whisper of stubble against my cheek the strong firm hands the way they rest on the curve of my back

ivanov and this whole romance of ours is commonplace and trite he lost heart and he lost his way she came along strong and brave in spirit and gave him an helping hand thats all very well and plausible in novels but in life

sasha in life its the same

ivanov i see you have a fine understanding of life

love and be loved settle for no less ask for no more

gavin i never thought you’d be the irrational one in this relationship but i’m happy to report that you’ve just thoroughly shocked me

you will be the one chosen to reach out to embrace man once again as the heart so that all will be as it should ‘fatumaleeleele’ you will give your fire so that man may live and he will give his heart so that earth may live

thus it has been spoken

you said i told you i was in love with someone else but i’m not that’s not what i meant cassandra was a part of my past but our time together ended the only person i want the only person i love is you

how do you know

well i don’t i’m making this up but i bet i’m right

all literature or most literature is about sex a burgess

i figure we go through things that make us stronger but we also go through things that just simply piss us off

wow she said do you realise how wonderful you sound

yes i do he said with a firm nod and i think i’m underappreciated

all the friends in the world are in the fountain of a pen

i dont care much for diamonds nicola had told him

have you ever been offered any he had asked and he had been making fun of her his face mocking

not that i can remember nicola had admitted calmly

and how would an offer be received he had asked as though he knew the answer

with a kick in the teeth nicola had said meeting his eye

all my life i have lived within the very hours of the hands of love

weave the circle tightly sewn

let nothing evil or unknown

on pain of death we cast you out

i want these gentle hands and this kind smile although i should not want such a thing

i deciced if i were ever to get into booze and women my line would be excuse me madam but i would really love to bed and muss you    are you perchance free this evening

now she had to pretend not to love the man she was pretending to love while pretending she wasnt sleeping with him

ive loved him for a decade and i had him for one day before i made a complete and utter mess of things or he did im still not sure about that

ill never love you anymore than i do right this second and ill never love you any less than ido right this second

raven scowled through his toolong bangs the angel song doesn’t hurt humans it only affects the evil within

then you should be writhing on the ground with the hounds mace mumbled

forever this time he said as sawyer strode toward them

tara sighed blissfully you know what this means right

im done guessing he said tell me

it means youre mine she said and im yours no more walking away we are going to get it right this time

his smile was slow and easy and just for her well finally

his attitude though always bad has changed since he helped me prep the pandora charm for morgan he thinks im falling for her as ridiculous as that sounds and he might be tempted to take matters into his hands

what happened to romance sappy soppy longhand love letters

he pulled her close kissing her mouth taking her by surprise he stepped back passion smoldering in his eyes she looked at him touching her mouth where his kiss still burned

hello dinner it’s me i’m starving and i know where you live

the soul they say is divine and the flesh is iniquity but i am a musician and i ask this  without the wood and the strings of the violin where would the sonata find form

hell had frozen over and i was lost in its endless labyrinth

perhaps i was being picky but i really didn’t think being able to spell orgasm without being spotted a vowel was asking too much

are you telling me youre cooking me dinner regan its the quickest way without physical contact to get a woman into bed the kitchen through there

did you let him know that if he cant see fit to return your blow job immediately you will have no choice but to sue

for a woman to deny the necessity of true love in her life would be to deny herself and her creator

her name was a silent song on his lips her love was like a circle in the water radiating ever outward inevitably encompassing even the remotest of hearts

after reason had left the dining room valor’s mouth softened into smile let us know if you have any symptoms

symptoms i asked and jerked my gaze to his eyes what kind of symptoms

tell us if your fingernails turn to stone victor chuckled

entwining his hands in her hair he kissed her with all the passion and love hed kept hidden in his heart for thirtysex years waiting for her only for her

as he felt her kiss him back the frozen wall inside him finally broke allowing life and sun inside his soul he pulled away stroking her cheeks as he looked down into her eyes

i love you carrie he whispered

i love you

but just for a minute i wont be gone long and if she wakes up before i get back tell her that i love her

so is this being in love i stay with the moment waiting to find out the space between us fluctuating with uncertainty the only thing i am sure of is that each time his lips leave mine they are right back again

he tends to go for girls who areshelby honey put your hands over your ears for just a sec back into the phone he said he likes the real slutty ones ow he yelled when he received a whop to the back of the head

we’ll make out for a while and you’ll feel better

hush i said i’m here and i’m not letting you out of my sight anytime soon so keep holding me tight i looked down a little more than afraid of plummeting hundreds of feet down breena to kian silver frost

i often wish id got on better with your father he said

but he never liked anyone whoour friends said clarissa and could have bitten her tongue for thus reminding peter that he had wanted to marry her

he buried his hands in the rich velvet of her hair i thought i’d die for wanting you

life was wonderful so filled with people and activities with love and laughter

the human race is all the same when it comes to romantic relations said the major a startling absence of impulse control combined with complete myopia

i had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel

theres a problem with marrying up you always worry that someday theyll see through you and leave or worse yet someone better will come along and take her in my case it wasnt someone and it wasnt something better

advising mrs harris was the least i could do david said smoothly after all she was the one who brought me and my late wife together

that was stretching it a bit since all charlotte had done was give sarah lessons in how to avoid fortune hunters thus ensuring that the recalcitrant girl went right out and married the first one who approached her

beth what are you the energizer bunny

i do not want to date you

he groaned liv youve got to be kidding me i picked up my whole life drove halfway across the country and youve changed your mind its only been fifteen days since you told me you still love me

she felt the glide of his hair as he lowered his head to study the zipper on her skirt her

imagination supplied other places his hair could touch and she drew in her breath

he carefully pulled down the zipper then pulled it back up after several up and down

hello have i lost you to a zipper darn she must sound like every greedy woman

whod ever lain with him

his soft chuckle reassured her  tis a long night lass and the waiting willna hurt ye

these metal teeth are wondrous things

maybe im deceiving myself perhaps i dont know him as well as id like to imagine what does a person so willing to utterly remake himself hold inside his heart can i trust such a man what motivates him

in an instant she knew and she felt a bit of relief

love love was what drove him

we’ve got to stop meeting like this

but then it was over too quickly and they pulled away she knew they couldnt stand there and kiss like a couple on the run in a thriller

there was a group of fans who wanted autographs and several women who managed to write their phone numbers on wades hand before he pulled free

sam sent him an arched brow but he just shrugged he got numbers written on him a lot hed never figured out how to stop that from happening

romance is everything to turn it into a cause for given is priceless

what are you doing

what does it look like i’m getting down on my knees

his head butted against her stomach her muscles clenched shocked at the touch even through the layer of cotton

i’ve never begged a woman for anything before enjoy this

she tried to think of something sufficiently sassy enjoy it i can’t even see it

it’s symbolic

suddenly he caught his reflection in the mirror behind her his face was twisted into a dark scowl and he was standing there naked with a boner and another man’s business card in his hand

he looked like a dick

olivia he sighed as he held her tight against him i like the way you leap

for once her laughter was free and easy and i like the way you catch me when i land

what happens next she whispered

connor turned to her and smiled faintly always a question that was rebecca

theres more he said in mock wonderment

you know very well there is more

tell me all about it he encouraged

in papas book—

tell me all about it without mentioning your papa

later she would think about how hed snuck up on her so silently the man was on crutches  what was he a ninja or something

please put the gun down and well talk a beautiful woman holding a small cannon plays hell with my concentration christovao chris santos sanctuary

he follwed her as she crossed to the fourstation apparatus his attention was glued to her butt the whole way realizing what he was doing he snapped his gaze away and checked to make sure no one had noticed

nope they were all too busy staring at jamies butt

my eyes burn with tears and im so tired so tired of holding back everything i feel and want to say so tired of being someone im not and making mistakes that i didnt have any fun making

love starts as a feeling

but to continue is a choice

and i find myself choosing you

more and more every day

a light rain touches my cheek like an angels butterfly kisses

beau what is it you want

a porch he says softly he says it like its my name and right then i think what both of us want more than anything is something we can never have all i really want is to build a house with a nice big porch that gets used every day

beauty is in the heart of the beholder

what was the point what is the point in love and promises of it when it can just jump from one person to another like that

how can you do sin with hands you used for prayers

holy fu he starts then catches himselfyesthis tithe will be most pleasing to her goodness me and magnus exchange amused glances

do you know where your breakthrough begins your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends

tis a sad day when ye ha t pinch yerself t see if yere awake or in th midst o a night terror tis a really sad day when ye have t pinch yerself twice

old woman nora to her three wee granddaughters on a cold winters night

you must be a rich man she said not much of a warrior though you keep letting me sneak up on you

you dont surprise me he said the plains indians had women who rode their horses eighteen hours a day they could shoot seven arrows consecutively have them all in the air at the same time they were the best light cavalry in the world

just my luck she said an educated indian

yeah he said reservation university

they both laughed at the old joke every indian is an alumnus

where you from she asked

wellpinit he said im a spokane

i shouldve known you got those fishermans hands

aint no salmon left in our river just a school bus and a few hundred basketballs

what the hell you talking about

our basketball team drives into the river and drowns every year he said its a tradition

she laughed youre just a storyteller aint you

im just telling you things before they happen he said the same things sons and daughters will tell your mothers and fathers

do you ever answer a question straight

depends on the question he said

do you want to be my powwow paradise

grayg i feel like i can tell you anything

ivymac you can thats what friends do

grayg ive never been friends with a girl before

ivymac im honored to be your first

like two stars in the depths of the sky

this gravity is just irresistible

we spin around each other you and i

when i fell for you i fell into your orbit

on creating a false identity for pheobe

how did her husband die greer asked

i hardly know ava said with a shrug as she rocked jonathan in her arms how do men typically die a fall from a horse or some such thing

i scarcely believe scores of men are falling to their deaths from their saddles greer said drily

once ye made up yer mind to do somethin tis better tstumble oer the small hillock of jumpahead than tbash yer head on the jagged rocks of didnothing

old woman nora of loch lomand to her three wee granddaughters one cold evening

anger precedes hate while love vicariously hangs in the balance

when it comes to love princess rules blur and traditions fade

he looked at her amazed with her sudden nerves sweetheart… marrying was never on any list of mine he reached for her hand and held it tightly in his but marrying you… now that’s something different

no man would ever hold me this well

i was made to be wrapped in these arms

a woman could tell a lot by the way a man holds her she could tell if he had the strength to endure the rougher moments if he had a mighty yet kind heart if he could make her feel safe and cherished

beau’s embrace said all that and more

he would always be around you not in these words or paintings but in your heart he will always be in happy memories you cant cage his worth in few pages and colors

having realized that her affection for sinclair went far beyond friendship there was only one thing for her to do she took off her hat and banged her head against the nearest lamppost

also realizing she was drawing attention from passerby she put her hat back on and resumed walking

words streamed from my mouth some familiar some not

the last of the were i love you

he rose up off me with a grin if id known it was that easy to get you to admit how you feel i would have done this a long time ago

i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love

but there was a difference between being stuck and choosing to stay between being found and finding yourself

we were a galaxy exploding into a million pieces creating a whole new world as we crashed against each other on the soft surface of his mattress a cloud in the darkness our bodies finally falling together like rain

denial can be beautiful

but only when youre a fantastic liar

let me guess you think we’re going to live happily ever after like some stupid fairy tale

why not his stare dared me to laugh or worse to argue

because the whole thing is ridiculous i said i despised the bitterness in my own voice i sounded so damaged good if he thought i was his soul mate for some mysterious reason he wouldn’t let on let him see the worst of me

it’s not ridiculous to me perhaps that’s the difference between predators and prey love i’ll never stop hunting but i expect that one day you’ll stop running

because i want to die

because you want to live

old and then you’ll be dead

you think he’s perfect and he’s safe and in your head he can do anything but he can’t save you sara and i can’t save you either

puhlease… team leather and cocks isn’t always right

i knew instantly that i wanted that type of love in my life to have someone i could take care of in every sense and who would trust me to do so no matter what i asked of them

wolves mated for life where was he where was the echo to her howl her mate was there no other lone wolf searching the hills for her

i can’t rock you on my lap if you’re not here

you’re my home susanna my home my heart my dearest love wherever you are that’s where i belong always  victor bramwell earl of rycliff

he is fairer than the morning star and whiter than the moon for his body i would give my soul and for his love i would surrender heaven

i am sure that god has given all his time in making you the remaining human race has been created in haste

enjoy the movie i hear the guy gets the girl i said my tone bold and flirtatious

which guy she laughed playing along i could hear her smile through the phone it felt good to make her smile really good

i paused before answering the one who deserves her

dont expect a man will try any harder to keep you than he did to get you

however i have to warn you i kind of like that you find me irresistible

did i say that he asked a slight tint creeping up his stubbled cheeks i didn’t say that i find you completely resistible

so we have twentyfour hours to keep out of trouble’ he says to me

i slide a glance in his direction judging from the way he’s now grimacing at the sidewalk and the fact that i met him in a police station where he was being booked for stealing a car i’m guessing that staying out of trouble is not his forte

if i were being honest with myself he lit a blaze not just a blush but that’s too much reality for me to admit

i focused rather embarrassingly on his chest which was rising and falling slowly

i’m a creature of the night slitted eyes peered at her suspiciously good god you’re not a morning person are you

for an age we stood there like that me holding him by the collar of his jacket and kissing him for all i was worth him standing there hands up like i was frisking him with no idea what to do about it

it was awesome

what is more natural than that a solidity a complicity a bond should be established between reader and reader thanks to the book

what i can make people do    it’s not what they want to do it may sound corny but i want people to like me for me not because i can force them to or because of who my mom is or who i am in the family you know

he raised his green gaze to my blue one that’s one of the things i like about you lila you don’t care about any of that

just one of the things i teased trying to make him laugh a little just so he’d forget his guilt and grief if only for a few moments

just one his voice took on a low husky note i could list all the others if you want

devon hesitated then leaned in just a little my breath caught in my throat

he inched forward a little more i wet my lips

lila he whispered

i shivered loving the sound of my name on his lips—lips that were heartbreakingly close to mine—

there really is a place where kisses taste like apple pie and where stars spill like sugar across the sky

youre a rose the perfect flower im a carnation just a cheaper substitute

i heard you were a player  okay  lets play a game

well flirt play fights talk  say goodmorning and goodnight every day give each other nicknames hang out talk on the phone for hours take cute pictures together make promises to each other and hold each other

and whoever falls in love first loses

have you gone crazy

have you gone crazy master

a vampires thirst can only be quenched by the blood of their loved ones

if you want romance fuck a journalist

i said youre the beat of my heart the breath in my body the light in my soul

thats itim completely giving up on boys and concentrating on staying alive

from every human being there rises a light that reaches straight to heaven and when two souls that are destined to be together find each other the streams of light flow together and a single brighter light goes forth from that united being

his eyes opened and he stared at me the morning light was streaming through the windowand my hair rolled in waves over either shoulder

god has smiled upon me i have the most beautiful wife in all the land

so for her ill try ill trust ill  open myself ill  be this guy ive never been before and dont even known how to be—this goofy in love guy this guy who takes care of his woman this guy who gives more than he takes

i love you so much i can hardly tell my own heart from yours anymore and ive never said it to another woman in my life as its never until now been true

love is when you’d rather see someone one last time and die than never see their face again

is there a problem ms parker something you want to say to me reaching for his tie he began to loosen it unraveling it with his fingers angry eyes still locked on mine

im not sure i like being your pet or science project i dont know which

you have a smart mouth

you make smart observances

youre going to make this invitation difficult arent you

if youre dishonest with me yes

youll regret it if you dont accept

is that a threat

thats a promise

that first scream my lord was indeed your daughter my wife and if you kill me your grandchild will be quite without a father wont you come in

soul bonds cant be broken they only bend for a while

im done waiting done doing things the easy way and letting things happen as they will

her heart caught what does that mean

it means this is too important to let slip away again youre too important he leaned back against the truck with a low grunt of effort eyes dark jaw clenched i love you too tara

obsessing over a boy makes the time fly

please let me take you home you’re drunk

i am not i shoved him spilling some kind of delicious poison on him go home and have a wild time with ms scarlet in the bedroom with the—

okay you’re starting to talk board game let’s go home babe i’ll get you into bed

stumbling closer i held up the manuscript the pages flapping frantically in the wind i take it this is a murder mystery you killed the exfiancée and thanked her in the dedication mighty dignified of you i must say

letting out a soft chuckle the tears began to blind me make me

she loved him more than she could ever find words for but this love he felt for her was not quite the same it wasnt so much stronger as more demanding more insistent as though he feared he would lose that which he had finally won

you next he said out of those clothes and into bed

she nodded but didnt move from sallys side the thought of undressing exhausted her where would she find the strength such a task would require

im filthy ill ruin the new bed

ill bring you some fresh water

ive no clothes to change into

his grin was downright wicked i know

a short laugh escaped her

i winked and locked my arm in carters and we stood there watching dean stroll away

you know the guys never gonna give up carter nudged me letting out a sigh

wed have really pretty babies huh

yup theyd be rad little brangelinas running around tearing the place up

yeah youre right my rejection is such a disservice to the world

hands still in the air jordan reached back and gently caressed her cheek dying for this woman would be no hardship hed die a thousand times over if it would take away her pain

since he had every intention of living a long and healthy life with eden at his side he sincerely hoped noah was on his way and dying wouldnt be necessary

where are you going

to get my bible

right now you cant get your bible out right now im im were just about to

shed never be able to go through with this if he got out his bible she wiped all humor from her face

i believe you proverbs  rejoice relish and romp with your husband

he chuckled im serious connie and i wont have you feeling ashamed or unclean over anything we do in that bed tonight or any other night

i wont i feel unashamed and very clean i promise but please dont get out that bible

what think you that god cant see us right now

groaning she slid off his lap and covered her face with her hands he sunk to his knees in front of her drawing her hands down

i love you you love me we are man and wife god is watching connie and he is very very pleased

nobody speaks smut to my wife and gets away with it

you know the kind of smile i’m talkin’ about that flirty cute biteyourbottom lip ‘cause his smile is so stinkin’ perfect—that kind of smile

you wont says the mayor smiling again everyone knows you arent a killer todd

he pushes viola forward again

she calls out from the pain of it

i grit my teeth and raise the rifle

i cock it

and i say whats true

i would kill to save her i say

her hands shot up see that’s exactly what i’m saying you’re seeing what you want and what you see you explain away and excuse things like you’re fixing me i’m not perfect ephraim and i really wish you would see that

you drool

what that caught her off guard

when you’re asleep you drool i’ve woken up more than a few times with a little puddle forming on my chest after a thought he added and you snore not a delicate snore either mind you

i do not her face colored with indignation

times like this were special memory builders when something extraordinary happened to a person the

kind of things remembered forever after it didnt have to be a lifechanging event like a graduation or

marriage or birth of a child it more often was the small things the sheer joy of summer sunlight on a

fragrant flower the giggle of a toddler the brush of a lovers fingertips and the person marks the

moment with the flashing insight thinking this is special i should remember this

before she could speak almost before she could feel a voice called lucy lucy lucy the silence of life had been broken by miss bartlett who stood brown against the view

brigid oshaughnessy i havent lived a good life ive been bad worse than you could know

sam spade you know thats good because if you actually were as innocent as you pretend to be wed never get anywhere

i would rather be a cripple and have your love for all of a single moment than to live as i am without ever having it

thank you she whispered sending up a quick prayer for his continued recovery

you’re welcome marcus murmured

honoria let out a little shriek of surprise jumping back nearly a foot

sorry he said but he was laughing

it was quite the loveliest sound honoria had ever heard

i wasn’t thanking you she said pertly

i know he smiled

no he cried and his face pinched with frustration and pain i dont want to hear more reasons why we shouldnt be together no more confessions to explain why you want to run away from what we share

julian she attempted to interrupt again but he held up a trembling hand

love outweighs the liabilities

his eyes glazed for a second all your vibrators

romance is about putting things aright after some tragedy has put them asunder it is about restoration of the right relations among things  and going home is where that restoration occurs because that is where it matters most

you ever get the feeling all hell’s about to break loose and there’s nothing you can do about it

she tugged warningly on his shirt i am serious are you going to marry me sean finally

he smiled and the light of his smile filled his eyes damn it elle will you not let me take the lead ladies do not propose marriage

theres nothing essentially romantic about things like roses or jewelry romance starts as some blank concept and then you just fill it in with objects so you have something to point to when you want to make it real

oh you want me to lie still while you check me out damn red if id have known that earlier i wouldve been horizontal already

summertime she speaks of winter she eats ham but speaks of beef got a good man but flirts with another she might as well go to hell cause she aint gonna be happy in heaven either

id make you my favorite jungle gym if youd let me

so how is it that you don’t have a girlfriend i asked boldly

have you ever had a girlfriend there was no way that he’d never had a girlfriend

he shrugged again

you’re not serious

you’re surprised

i’m sorry do you own a mirror

joel laughed in that i’llneverunderstandwomen kind of way i’ve never wanted one he admitted though it seemed that there was more to it

what a mirror or a girlfriend

he laughed again even harder this time a girlfriend

are you gay

he smiled no i’m not gay

oh i blushed why was i being so nosy all of a sudden

what if we have a child together

his jaw dropped that wont happen i dont need more kids

what if i do

then youd better find yourself another father for them

before during or after our marriage

his lids dropped lower over his azure gaze i dont know if ive ever met anyone who can jumpstart my asshole gene like you do

i wanted to apologize but what could i say i’m sorry but i’m afraid my fangs might freak you out oh and by the way my eyes sort of glow in the dark when i get excited i hope you’re cool with that

how could i have ever loved peg i love you and too late he realized that the words he had just spoken were the truth

he closed his eyes holding her even more tightly allowing himself to finally realize and identify his feelings he was stunned by their enormity their intensity their power

my darling love i think you have a fundamental misconception about what it means to be a great dandy i have better taste than anyone else so i dont care what anyone else thinks about anything i am right and they are wrong

it does this is how it should have been anyway i caught my breath as he kissed my neck teeth grating my skin and ill take back whats mine

was it enough to wear the night with me just once i am unsatisfied

a man doesnt want to be rejected were really quite sensitive

sensitive she laughed her head on one side sensitive egos you mean never met a man who didnt have one of those

whew he said you clean up good you don’t look like the same girl

she frowned right before she laughed do women usually thank you for saying things like that

queer creatures females mused mr standen shaking his head fellows only got to be a rake to have em all dangling after him silly really because it stands to reason well never mind that

i wonder if you know how special you are i wonder if you know how precious you are i wonder if you know how lucky i am to have you in my life i love you so much

a hundred years or more shes bent her crown

surviving all the random vagaries

of this harsh world a dense  twigged veil drifts down

from crown along her trunk  mourning slow wood

that rustles tattered in a hint of wind

this january dusk cloudy purpling

the ground with sudden shadows

how she broods

you speculate  on dark surprise and loss

alone these many years despondent bent

her boltcracked mate transformed to splinters moss

though not alone you feel the sadness of a

twilight breeze theres never enough love

the widow nods to you her branches moan

midnight omen deja vu  because everyone should experience love in the caribbeanat least once in a lifetime

i want to take ye to bed in my bed and i mean to spend the rest of the day thinking

what to do wit ye once i got ye there so wee archie can just go and play at marbles

with his bollucks aye

i’m not this unusual she said it’s just my hair

never to be squanderedthe miracle of another human being

without attachment a naked body is merely a lifeless sextoy

gwen its not going to work

gwen cinderellas not going to sleep with you because youre taking the ugly stepsister to the ball shell still make you wait

i can think of only one good solution to this dilemma diego said having spent the entire night developing a plan

you sneak into the school and carry her off gaspar quipped

that is the notsogood solution and it would be very difficult to sneak into a house full of women without raising an alarm

a cloud descended on gaspars brow i was not serious kidnapping is not a choice

poppy what makes you think im having dinner with you

jake because you cant sit in your room and eat ice cream and chips two nights in a row youll get scurvy you need vitamin c

maybe none of us can choose who we love cas none of the lucky ones anyway the only choice we have is how we serve that love and ethan’s made his choice what about you are you going to reject it or make the best of what you’ve been given

he sauntered towards her oozing charisma from every pore charlee forgot to breathe and then he committed the gravest sin of all knocking her world helterskelter the scoundrel smiled

we make a pretty good team huh

the best in fact i was planning to do this when we got back to the fairmont but suddenly i dont want to wait

for what

reaching into the pocket of his black pinstripe suit coat he retrieved a huge squarecut diamond ring and slid it onto her left hand what do you say we make this partnership official

tears flooded her eyes do you promise to love me forever

his blue eyes went dark with desire and love as he nodded forever and ever

he smiled and wrapped his little finger around hers pinky swear

she leaned in to kiss him then youve got yourself a deal

having declared a passion for his wildness she had sought from the beginning to tame him

it was now twenty minutes past four in the morning allowing for the fact that the clock in the library of his town house was four minutes slow as it had been for as far back as he could remember

it was probably better to leave the clock as it was

brooke he finally found the sense to ask what are you doing here

i need a gun

this was not how his dream was supposed to go

there was another reason why i wasnt ready to tell you all this that night in the airport

what other reason

guess what today is

even better it comes around once every four years last day of february ringing any bells he let that settle for a long moment before he curled his face into the half grin she loved so much its leap day baby

ty didnt think middleton was a great girl he thought middleton was a pain in the ass waltzing around with her shiny hair and long legs and her throaty voice being cuter than a fistful of buttons where did she get off

what have you done with hetty he demanded

while he’d been tentatively considering a possible romantic relationship with her she’d fallen in love with him

he could barely speak why didn’t you tell me

mason snorted yeah that’s right do you like maira check yes or no come on you’re almost thirty you’re old enough to go after what you want

what came to me later in those dark dreaming hours put paid to that though and as always my mind led me treacherously back to the bleak and inescapable truth

there was no cure for what one had seen or done

there is a perfection in everything that cannot be owned

to feel aroused is to feel alive having great sex is like taking in huge lungfuls of fresh air essential to your body essential to your health and essential to your life

the curves of your lips rewrite history

i hope you outlive me so i never have to know what life is like without you

i know the world is still out there and i know im not yet friendly to its pace but as long as i know him with me here there somewhere – us – i know i have a chance

my knees were weak but he held me with one hand guiding me with the motion of his hips i was completely his to do with what he wanted and he knew it

shes magic cassandra a single flower blooming in an endless desert

no ye loved him i canna hold it against either of you that ye mourn him and it gives me some comfort to know  he hesitated and i reached up to smooth the rumpled hair off his face

to know what

that should the need come you might mourn for me that way he said softly

i’m not that pitiful little girl you bullied last year

what the dev— er deuce did you do that for it hurt

good said the angel i was afraid these new shoes would not be sturdy enough

that casual glance was the beginning of a cataclysm of love that had still not ended half a century later

i just meant that … i want to be the last person who ever kisses you too… that sounds bad like a death threat or something what i’m trying to say is you’re it this is it for me

you’re here

of course i am where else would i be

i thought…well i wasn’t sure if this was our dream or just mine

it’s ours livvie it’s ours always ours

in his arms i’ve finally found the place i’ve been looking for where fear can’t touch me where memories can’t reach where the past is forgotten and the present is enough where the present is in fact all that matters

it is possible said miss marling stiffly that frederick and not mary will have the ordering of the

vidal chuckled not if i know my mary he replied

trust me’ he says with a touch of impatience

‘stop asking me to do that’ i say equally as impatiently

km yes mrs lopez shes human and you know clearly shed like people to show some appreciation for her hard work but if people just you know take her pie and dont even say hey nice pie they just scarf it down or whatever

mh i could see how that would get to be annoying i mean if youre constantly providingpie and getting no positive feedback

michael scrambled around again and kissed james’s lips and cheeks in brief silly pecks

you offering or ordering james grumbled

i’m offering to cook if you’re offering up the groceries do you have eggs

no i have sperm what the hell do they teach you in school these days

michael giggled chicken eggs wise ass in your refrigerator

i will not let them harm you i will protect you till my last breath

i want to introduce myself to every freckle on your body

is there anything sweeter than the touch of another as she pulls a dead bug from your fur

marry me youll learn to love me i promise

there is only one kind of love but there are a thousand different versions

what do you see when you look at me

on second thought he exhaled letting his head drop next to mine you’re psychic

if a man truly loves he gives no heed to what others may think his heart has no room for that for it is filled to the brim with the unutterable truth of his feelings

okay babe im here

the front door smashed opened slamming against the wall—the man didnt know how to turn a knob

yeah you want to do some other worldly hanky panky she laughed and almost fell off the couch hanky panky dont knock it till you try it

i never had any preference for her any more than i have a preference for breathing

you never learn the first time you always have to get hit twice before you see it coming he was seeing now what he’d seen that first night at pure a bright shiny light he wanted to catch in his hands and hold forever if she let him

for the first time since shed pieced her heart back together she felt a small tug at one of the strings she dropped her hands to her sides and took a step back the one word shed waited to hear could destroy her carefully constructed life

dont

dont make me forget dont make it better dont make me love you again

autumn haven

the most intimate moments in the world dont happen in nightclubs or backstage or even on the movie screen they were moments like this sitting silently comfortably holding hands on a darkened bedroom floor

i better go carter squeezed me once more and stood grabbing his wallet from the coffee table i need to hit up the lottery if i want to get you out of this mess will you let me buy a monkey if we win though

only if you buy me an island off the coast of fiji

you crazyass woman a monkey is so much cooler than an island

how about a monkey in fiji

now theres a woman after my own heart carter slapped his hand to his chest sighing dramatically ill let you know if we win he started for the door

youll know if we do ill be the one streaking on pike street

as we stood there chest high in water i felt like i was in the middle of my own romance novel

his voice sounded like molten metal as if he had something thick at the back of his throat and it was making him sound deeper and richer than he actually was

can you find beauty in darkness eve danny asked

she nodded yes

then look for it he said softly

dean unable to repress my amusement my eyes flew wide and my grin grew

either that or we can go all sweeney todd on him and

oh will you stop my laughter was crippling there will be no calls to your uncle and no trip to the barber shopplease leave sweeney todd out of it

he suggested devils skulls harsh masculine drawings this thing was…heart poundingly good she wanted to pluck it and bury her face in it and keep it in a vase by her bedside

hey kate you coming to our show friday night he leaned in close and touched my shoulder the guys would love to see you there

yes yes the guys would indeed carter rolled his eyes and smirked i held back my grin well aware that he was laughing inwardly at the same thing i was when dean spoke of the guys he mostly meant himself

with a body like a ken doll and hair like merediths mcdreamy i couldnt figure out for the life of me what he wanted with me

just that one word—sound—sent a strong answering pulse through her body his tongue curled around syllables that weren’t there like a promise this is what you’ll get if you just let me hear

love me for stupid reasons

i like those most

your big scary husband is crying

never let other people bring you down let jesus be the one who brings you down because he knows what he is doing

unbidden unwelcome yet unable to resist i entered a strangers life

if you dont start playing by my rules youll be lucky to be licking stamps in some lowly legal aid office

i am eternally devastatingly romantic and i thought people would see it because romantic doesnt mean sugary its dark and tormented — the furor of passion the despair of an idealism that you cant attain

you’re apologizing seriously what happened to you have you been taken over by a pod person

to quote french author françois mauriac ‘tell me what you read and ill tell you who your are is true enough but id know you better if you told me what you reread

i clung to each word that fell from his lips like a spider to a web

one day kanames lips will lightly touch this neck of yours and slowly kanames teeth will sink in if you hear the sound of kaname drinking your own blood yukichan then for sure youll feel ecstasy

i want to bask deeply in the taste of his blood in that flowing crimson filled with his feelings melted in it

caillen dagan to desideria denarii

every men wanted to be his friend and every woman wanted to be in his bed

i want not an annulment

because just being

around you makes me so fucking happy you airhead i

like you i want you i see my unborn children in your

eyes—okay scratch that one i swear to fuck i’m not

being flip here i sighed what my heart does

whenever you’re near isn’t just about chemistry cam

it’s like…stargazing i feel insignificant and dazzled

would you guys choose to walk away from possibly the most incredible encounter of your lifetime just because you had to let it go sooner then you wanted just because you knew that it would never be

you said weve got a new page i figure ive got some say in what gets written on it so im going to work on you last time around you threw yourself at me i did no such thing

i dont know why i waste my time trying to mend fences with you youre as arrogant as you ever were

just the way you like me sweetheart

i felt like a thief with a bagful of stolen glances

shes as plastic as you are im telling you its a bad idea if the two of you have kids theyll come out of the birth canal with fisherprice stamped on their butts

lord randall barreled inside brandishing his cane in drews face

you beggarly knave i was told this marriage was in name only who gave you permission to consummate the vows

theodore hopkin governor of this colony representative of the kind and its going to cost you plenty for that daughter of yours is nothing but trouble what in the blazes were you thinking to allow her an education

drew bit back his smile at the mans shocked expression nothing like landing the first punch

lord randall furrowed his bushy gray brows

i knew not about her education until it was too late

drew straightened the cuffs of his shirt

well be prepared to pay dearly for it no man should have to suffer through what i do with the constant spouting of the most addlepated word puzzles you could imagine

lord randall spewed ale across the floor what surely drink has tickled your poor brain youre a farmer you impudent rascal ill give you five thousand

drew plopped his drink onto the table at his side its contents sloshing over the rim a satisfied smile broke across his face

excellent he stood

when will you take her back to england with you today tomorrow

the old mans redrimmed eyes widened

i cannot take her back why shes already birthed a child

drew shrugged fifteen thousand or i send her and the babe back with or without you

gavin turned us to face josh a satisfied grin springing up when he noticed the condition of josh’s clothes

thanks for the lastminute invitation man josh chuckled patting gavin on the shoulder shall i do the honors mr suave

josh’s chin shot down to follow gavin’s amusement and he quickly tried to wipe away the crumbs yeah well … you know how we hobbits like to eat

ever forward cecile’s voice replayed in my mind ever forward

what was the point of starting a new life if she did everything the same as her old one

she was evil couldnt he who killed demons with his own hands realize that and now i had to run for mardi gras queen because of him or her i didnt know whose fault it was but there was no way i could back down now

fyi women think glasses are a sign of brains and also theyre sexy

holy bon jovi the queen of darkness actually had a soul

wait a minute sandra said sounding skeptical you were really stuck

things were starting to get worse

her mouth dropped open and she began to laugh—the kind of laugh that would have been music to his ears if she were laughing with him and not at him

things were definitely worse

the unexpected moment is always sweeter

the longer i lived the longer it would be until i saw him alive again until i could taste his new lips and run my fingers through his new hair we could be young and beautiful again

what have i done to her gabriel muttered to himself as he crossed the room to crank open a window cool air washed over his skin what the devil did she do to me

one day my lady said mr keeper stepping aside and allowing her to join them i should hope i would be fortunate enough to see such a graceful unearthly curtsy from you again

now that the house was securely hidden the fact that he was holed up with havily sent a wave of heat over his body im not going to be able to keep away from you he said tell me you know that tell me you understand

her eyelids fell to halfmast as she released a deep sigh another wave of honeysucke hit him square in the chest no one is asking you to warrior

maddie swallowed hard and tried to channel… which actress damn she couldn’t think of an

actress to save her life she was on her own

youre a virgin you have no idea what youre asking for

then you will have to teach me

not like this not on a horse in the middle of nowhere

max youll never be good enough to deserve her you know

ash god doesnt always give you what you deserve ash said quietly sometimes he gives you what you cant live without

i dont know yet what were called or if we have

a name i know so little and need to learn so much im many things detective and all of them love you

misunderstanding and distrust—the predominant elements of a novel without them everyone lives happily from beginning

rest logan said both of you his caressing gaze moved over his wife and infant daughter

ill watch over you

love me madeline asked with a faint smile and yawned again

it used to be love he brushed his lips over her closed eyelids now theres no word for it

you once told me that you thought love was a weakness

i was wrong he whispered kissing the corners of her mouth ive discovered its my only

madeline fell asleep with a smile still on her lips her hand curled around his

you said shes a senior babe were all crazy

never give a woman flowers to say i love you  tell her how much you love her and you will wake up looking at the flowers beside her bed

when you die you just die no ghost no reincarnation no heaven people want to believe that their souls live on or whatever but thats only because they cant handle the idea of the world going on without them

love is a trick best performed by men

gem there is an exception to every rule and we are going to be it im not losing you

… looking at her i think i know better what romantic love is

… she asked what is it

it washed all over me and through me into the floor and then it was gone i never cried for my da again after that and gods presence has been with me ever since  adien macrae between

if they’d caused you pain i’d never have been able to live with myself he said as he backed up a step

you might want to find another place to sit those idiots could cook up a plan for revenge

i can’t leave green eyes took a huge breath this is the only place where i get to see you he looked like a man who’d just bet his entire fortune and laid his cards on the table

my life would be sour grapes and ashes without you

within moments she stood naked before himaside from her garters and stockings

why is it that ye always strip me bare but leave these things on she asked absently as he stepped back to work at his own clothing

to give you something to complain about he said with a big grin

look id sat through just as many hollywood movies as the next person id seen sleepless in seattle titanic twilight whatever i knew the myth but i didnt believe it i knew it was made up i knew none of it was even close to reality

dont be jealous be agressive make  yours

there wasnt a shed of doubt in her mind that hed fulfill her every sexual fantasy and them some

but was a brief hot affair worth losing his friendship

what are you doing here

all right he was standing in front of an easel holding a paint palette and brush taxidermy he responded with just a touch of his own sarcasm

love is a smoke raisd with the fume of sighs being purgd a fire sparkling in lovers eyes being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears what is it else a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet

i didnt want to fight with him and yet i could not promise him what i most wanted to give  my love the promise that i would stay with him in the winter court that i would throw caution aside and be with him

a quick thought shot through my mind could i really drown in a dream i remembered the movie the matrix if you died in the matrix you died in real life i wasn’t about to take a chance

i knew i was a little different from most demons but nothing says freak of nature like a oneeyed gypsy saying i had a rainbow glow it just didnt sound complimentary

knowing i will see you forever in my dreams in this world or the next

i think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her wellloved eyes

what new york city football team did joe namath play for

the new york city yankees

a roar of laughter went up from the crowd accompanied by more than a few loud groans bobby tom silenced them all with a glare at the same time the glitter in his eyes dared any of them to contradict her

and that was how every last person in telarosa texas came to understand that bobby tom denton had finally and forever fallen head over heels in love

love was i really hearing this you are in love with me

totally one hundred percent head over heels in love with you morg have been ever since you led me on that goofy chase around the white house

sometimes you can cattle rope your heart and sometimes you cant is all

it doesn’t matter if you don’t love me right away he said just give me a chance

he was like a lot of warmbloods massive and showy and a bit of a dumb jock

though trish and her bad boy types werent exactly kindras style she had to agree that violet went for quiet and uninteresting sort of like mild salsa why even bother youd be better off just biting a tomato

sexy with a capital sex

hey max i whispered i love you too

the smile that lit up his face was brighter than the neon lights radiating from the london eye but mine felt even brighter

like my future

he looks kind but hes really a huge sex fiend hes perverted and spoiled and always jealous and he hasnt called me for two weeks but hes cool isnt he my guy im the only one that knowsthat the coolest part of him is his naked back

viola to duke orsino ill do my best

to woo your lady

he smelled the salt on his own lips and the orange blossoms in her hair real ones he could see now tucked into the curls with cheap native combs the sight of them gave him hope

gabrielle chuckled her dark eyes twinkling so he’s been after you has he poor etta pursued by a sun priest offering to pleasure—

every nook and cranny marietta interrupted dryly and gabrielle tipped her head back with a throaty laugh

surelybut i am very off from that

from surely from indeed from the decent arrow

that was my clean naivete and my faith

this morning men deliver wounds and death

they will deliver death and wounds tomorrow

he glared at her you cannot bring fashion sense into a superhero discussion

if they wear it it’s fair game she folded her arms on the table

fill your paper with the breathings of your heart william wordsworth

being an author is like being in charge of your own personal insane asylum graycie harmon

how many fears came between us

earthquakes diseases wars where hell

from skies made of winged death

horror tore this world asunder

while inside the bleeding smoke

and beyond the shredded weeping flesh

we memorized tales of infinite good

reg speaking of blunt dinner is on my bill tonight mes amis

alex whats the occasion

augustus lady carolines agreed to venture out on a picnic with out intrepid hero

kit i dont know why you keep insisting shes smitten with me ive barely spoken five sentences to her

augustus its very simple reg has thrown his entire being into pleasing caroline she knows every nuance of his thought and character you however are a mystery to be explored solved and resolved

you’re supposed to pinch yourself – not the one you’re dreaming about

his smiling face revealed a love too strong to be kept inside but the feelings obviously rising inside him kept him from looking directly at kikunojou he gazed instead at kikunojous clear reflection on the water

there was an infinitesimal pause while he watched her face as though he half expected her to recognise it before he went on my friends call me thorn and gave her a smile of such devastating charm that she blinked

the momentwhen i could no longer face myself in the mirrorwasnt easily explained nor was the oppressive misery i experienced once i finally became the person i was meant to be but then realized with terrific horror how much i still hated her

has she glanced you way yet

nick glanced at him shes not completely disinterested

i see moreland that makes it an even half dozen hanging out for a rich wife four looking for their second rossman the old satyr certainly isnt likely to be much competition what in the hell does he think hes doing anyway he must be sixty

basking i should think she hasnt given him the cold shoulder yet nick responded coolly

that implacable lover who was going to turn billys eyes away from me forever

you my dear are a creature of the night you are a vampire

i am to take mademoiselle to the moon and there i shall seek a cave in one of the white valleys among the volcanotops and mademoiselle shall live with me there and only me

nope he didn’t like it she saw the hand not holding the bottle of beer curl into a fist

sin and del from sunscapes trilogy book  last chance

nicholas i know you brother youve been threatened with matrimonial pursuits before why are you really here

william i received an invitation

nicholas not from me you didnt

william of course not from you brother parliament would go up in flames before i receive a social invitation from you

reg furths in london and yes i know its my fault but as long as iver roused the lion i was going to ask you to speak to him on my behalf

alex you wish me to speak to furth

reg well yes hes always like you just tell him what a noble upright fellow i am and how i have always upheld my position with dignity and respect

alex lie you mean

reg whatever it takes

alex turned his head to view a rainbow peacock mask bobbing toward him good lord francis you are replendent he said admiringly

the peacock stopped beside him dash it everton howd you know it was me

youre still wearing your faux ruby ring

im not too heavy she asked he had just come off crutches after all

sophie youre practically a midget he reminded her

i’ve never needed a bodyguard evan

his hands stilled on the glasses

maybe that isn’t such a bad idea now

it’s a terrible idea i would never want anyone watching every move i make it’s unnerving there are fresh lemons in the bottom drawer

evan squatted and tugged open the vegetable crisper inside the refrigerator you know he waved a piece of the yellow fruit for emphasis you may want to think about it though

morgan smacked the table so hard the salt and pepper shakers jumped

he grinned and stood haven’t lost your temper i see

my temper wasn’t burned

miss masters was not content with threatening to hire away his staff oh no first she had to perfume it

stronger than mountains

a place where my heart

feels the safest

underneath his shirt

myself

in you

i immerse myself

into a

that somehow this insufferable girl would become the one person i am forever hopelessly madly drawn to against my will and possibly even my better judgment

he didnt take any of my shit i needed that

loving you was like jumping into the dark side of a pool and drowning

the first rule in the book of love is acceptance

there is the purity of love harmonious in every way but not meant for a lifetime and then there is the steady love of commitment  no less real but completely different she had both

she blinked her eyes open her lips parted and cheeks flushed looking every bit like a goddess before him and if he were a better man he wouldn’t have been able to taint such purity but he wasn’t a better man and there was no turning back now

she gazed at him alluringly and grinned no further words were necessary

chains that hold me to the ground

chains that keep me solidly bound

chains that tether my heart to you

chains that only one truth

to lovers there

most ladies the reason they are dumped and their relationship doesnt last is they made themselves to become a want than a need in a relationship

your poetryit doesnt deserve to be locked away hidden from the rest of the world and neither do you

they kissed in the middle of the sidewalk letting the crowds of people flow around them like water around an island

for all the awkward girls that think they’re alone

you’re not

ba’t hindi ikaw i damn love you coreen hindi ko kaya how many times do i have to tell you that namulat na lang ako na mahal kita at hindi iyon tulad sa pag ibig mo kay noah na biglaan na lang naglalaho

every day i want to sleep in your arms and wake up by your side in the mornings

do you think someone can change like maybe in a year or two like do you think if maybe two people arent right for each other right now maybe they could be later

thats just a little bit about me

you give me butterflies when i thing about you

hearsay even from the people i love doesnt equate to gospel truth

the sweatshirt was big on her and she looked ridiculous he liked it and he liked that she was wearing something that carried his scent

i love being aroused

i relish that delicious feeling of freedom the delirium of being naked and my flesh being born again

it’s like i’m being made new

people make mistakes all the time – some of us just are in more of a position to leave an impact when we do

the heart has its own reasons that reason cant understand

i don’t need another ‘adversity builds character’ speech darren that man is a chauvinistic pig where’s your adversity

darren raised a brow i’m looking at it

in a word it was impossible for me to separate her in the past or in the present from the innermost life of my life

it was the impatience of the way he tore my panties from my body that really turned me on i was all he could think of as his lust got the better of him

i glanced back and saw the underwear torn and discarded a little strip of thin black material on the floor and thought yes this is the kind of impatient sex i’m looking for

the way they looked so small and cruelly forgotten was a beautiful symbol of how much we both needed to satisfy our lusts

sex is more exciting on the screen and between the pages than between the sheets

i thought i had everything until i found you

then by your definition im in love with you

we couldn’t be friends we couldn’t be enemies

so what were we

her mouth set ive already lost one man i loved tonight i will not lose the other she glared at him and curse you you stone head for making me say it first

someday ry you are going to realize who darren really is he’s a prince and he’s only going to break your heart

the earth must have done some noble work that is why you were born here and not in the ocean among the fishes and not in the sky among the birds

anything for byron’s least favorite apprentice it’s the least i can do since you took over my torch

you can be a great man and still be a fool many of our country’s leaders can attest to that were they still living

shane kissed her one more time lightly and softly and fluffed her hair back from her face to be continued he said

i’m not like you i’ve never cared about keeping relationships or sparing people’s feelings all i’ve ever cared about is power how to get it and how to keep it i told you as much when we met

if they really want us to be happy theyd let us pick ourselves

a thousand hearts will read these words

as you read them graze them this moment

thousands will utter them into the abyss someday perhaps for years to come loudly softly

repeatedly again and again and again

some will mock some will laugh some

will shed a tear

but it is written

only for your lips your eyes your heart

one doesnt fall into love one digs a hole for himself to trip claiming he didnt see it coming

i need a favour’

i raise my eyebrows at him in disbelief what makes him think i’m about to do him a favour he’s a stranger and he’s wearing handcuffs

the multicolored kitten snuggled between her breasts

what thats a wussy name shed totally get her ass kicked by all the other neighborhood cats you cant call herthat see i cant even say it its too ridiculous

abby chuckled and the sound drifted over him like a warm breeze

i suppose you want me to call her rowdy or bullet or chainsaw she said

those arent bad he liked it when she teased him maybe you could name her something like flash or blaze or storm

or maybe i could call her pooty pie

oh my god he slapped his forehead youre killing me youd be better off sticking with sweetums

ha she pointed her finger at him you said it before he could wrap his hand around that finger and pull her against him he gave the kittenwho purred contentedly between abbys breastsa rub between the ears

youre wearing a lace thong dolly clapped her hands thats absolutely perfect for romance

ultimate prosperity is ones value within it takes a man of depth morality and charm to be envied yet without a sign of wealth or romance a passion to prove such inner worth is his permission to achieve whatever he desires

i’m a firm believer in equality at all times—

at all times she glanced at the cuffs clipped to his leathers why do i find that hard to believe and why the heck was she arguing with him mine mine mine

at all times he repeated however in the bedroom or in the club i am a lot more equal than you

ive given up men its true at first i was just going to give up attorneys but that seemed immature  and far too exclusive so im playing it safe and giving up all the peniscarrying humans

romance is very pretty in novels but the romance of a life is always a melancholy matter they are most happy who have no story to tell

darling if i take your breath away i will give you mine

so what if the air

my shirt smells of you

you’re fearless

draven laughed loudly and shook his head zarah frowned and crossed her arms over her chest

no i’m not trust me i’m scared all the time you scare the living hell out of me

i scare you

anyone who isn’t scared of you is insane

if fancys lips had been real cherries probably dicks would have appeared deeply stained

it is possible to compromise in certain areas when choosing a partner for life but never on a cravat

only a heart that knows how to love can ever be broken

and finally she saw him smile it chased the shadows from his face and made him a boy again it was a smile that a woman could grow to yearn for

a warrior becomes experienced by being defeated a scholar by making mistakes defeat and mistakes we have left in the past he said

how is it that i am completely naked while you haven’t shed even one stitch of clothing

because you were dinner rebecca

a snort escaped mixing with her laughter remind me to have dinner with you more often i have been missing out

you what about me

this she thought was what love and desperation made you do say things that were better left unsaid give yourself away in a million little gestures a thousand little changes of expression

uh oh maybe i’m hysterical no the look on his face had been so funny did he really think to kiss me into submission that shit might work in romance novels but not on me if he wants to kiss me he’ll have to earn that privilege again

the phrase she was so mad she could chew nails and spit screws ran though his mind at her look damn he had really fucked things up between them why hadn’t he taken her calls again

oh yeah to give her a chance at a good life

she had known for a while that chance would be her first she hadn’t planned it would be tonight but it felt right fourth of july fireworks and her first time

ritsu do you like oda more than me

please tell me what your favorite flavor of ice cream is

i writebecause i must write

being amongst rough lives and confusion does not make you less it only makes your beauty shine out more clearly

i would not have imagined that love himself would have such a fatal blow this

you’ll have to fall in love at least once in your life or paris has failed to rub off on you

if someday you should ever think of me and miss me know in your heart that id want you to find me once again no matter how distant in time or space find me

his eyes are blazing with light more light than all the lights in every city in the whole world more light than we could ever invent if we had ten thousand billion years

you spanked me she told him

i did he lifted her shoulders high enough to push a wedge pillow under the pad and i enjoyed it very much you have a very spankable ass no

nothing has ever been so painful or delicious as being so close to him and being unable to do anything about it like eating ice cream so fast on a hot day you get a splitting headache

she rubbed her cheek on his chest like a sleepy cat i like when you hold me

dios she was going to break his heart i like when i hold you too

that’s an awful lot of littles don’t you think

perhaps he displayed his hand big he set hers next to his so small and delicate contrasted with his thick blunt fingers why did holding her fragile hand raise every protective instinct he had

slut i’m a dirty

the sound of a hand hitting flesh was simultaneous with the shocking sting on her bottom ow

you don’t think those nasty thoughts about my sumisita kimberly

but do you want this its not much of a life

dont you see its the first life ive had in four hundred years with youin the only way that mattersim alive again

it’s just the love for her in my heart that is morphing into this madness and how can i run away from it sometimes i want to when i can’t bear it anymore but where will i go

eccolo he exclaimed

at the same moment the ground gave way and with a cry she fell out of the wood light and beauty enveloped her she had fallen on to a little open terrace which was covered with violets from end to end

courage cried her companion now standing some six feet above courage and love

standing at its brink like a swimmer who prepares was the good man but he was not the good man that she had expected and he was alone

it would be too easy to become infatuated with a man like him and also decidedly unwise considering the female debris left in his wake

he thoroughly intended to do some major grovelling olympicstyle begging if necessary

you dont have to kiss a lot of frogs to recognize a prince when you find one

beneath her curls i forget the world

with a mere gaze she raises my hopes of gold

love is as much in her heart as in mine

but she doesn’t say it her punishment so divine

pick a sunset and well ride off into it together

because you have my heart virgilia wessex softly almost achingly every black ounce of it scars and all

only great fools remain ungrateful

bella i love you

edward you are my life now

it was as if the rare joy that had formed in my heart was replaced by a pale shadow threatening to engulf me at that very moment victory didn’t matter now she did

ever been kissed

of coursedescribe it

whyi want to know if youve

he turned then and those blue eyes met hers from across the sea of people her stomach bottomed out damn it she couldnt be attracted to the arrogant ass

somehow repeating herself wasnt helping

she trailed off when she realised will was turning a dull red for a big muscular guy he sure blushed a lot

no fairy tale this this was by no stretch of the imagination a polished fantasy this was a searing living force rough around the edges unfamiliar and bittersweet

and precious

why should you think that i should woo in scorn

scorn and derision never come in tears

look when i vow i weep and vows so born

in their nativity all truth appears

how can these things in me seem scorn to you

bearing the badge of faith to prove them true

we have formed a sick little friendship over the past year

dont leave yet he said his voice hoarse let me do something let me feed you hold you rub your shoulders change your oil anything please

we are only victims if we allow ourselves to be

through the darkest hours of the night

and through the dreamers realm i seek

far beyond the starry sky

and beyond galaxies i am free

through the grimmest memories

and past a seasons air i cannot breathe

far beyond this mortal world

in an afterlife we shall meet

she opened her eyes is this real

very real i brushed the soaked strands off her cheek wondering if i was lying or not and if i should care if i was angel let me kiss you

but you were concerned about making sure things you know didnt get serious

yeah because im an idiot

bathsheba looked at benedict you never told me they were matchmaking

we notorious women tend to stand out she said

i can feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love

why didnt you let me die you could have finally been free

i gave up trying to imagine a world without you  essallie  kayden

i can do all things through christ who strengthens mephil

i don’t want to hear it go back to sammy and get your platter of gonorrhea with a heaping side order of chlamydia it’s free please leave

haven’t i proved to you yet that i don’t give a damn about your missing parts

it’s been said that i have a problem admitting when i’m wrong the main reason is because i never am

we both must burn this midnight oil together you’re just as new to me as i am you andrew

i felt the same way the world felt about kurtis it revolved around him

love is not jealous

sunny laughed its okay youre right emma my name is unusual but i like to think of it as special also

yeah special was one word for her

she tapped her chest no i’m not a freak okay so could you stop pressuring me

rafael muttered something under his breath throwing up his hands in surrender so what am i what’s karhl jayani my brother and all the basatai are we all freaks just

because this human has some kind of fascination with labeling you you believe in it be your own person armani not what someone else says you are

when you are in a room with kurtis whether its one or a hundred he is the only person that matters

morning breath here ‘a dirty mouth you say’ clean it up with orbit maya chuckled unless you have gum i’m not letting you near me she reached for a pillow and plopped it over her face

haha good one no gum on me but i’ll settle for kissing your belly alex whisked her pajama top up and knelt down to kiss the roundest part of her tummy

you are safe with me

i am not at all safe with you but i have no desire to be elsewhere

mistakes thats why they put erasers on pencils

its hard to walk away from a winning streak even harder to leave the table when youre on a losing one

my love you are playing with a fire that you do not fully understand his voice was deep and controlled there are times i may not be able to control myself i am injured and i need to feed – this would be one of those times cole

is the mask magic he demanded with sudden passionate interest

yes i bowed my head so that our eyes no longer met i made it magic to keep you safe the mask is your friend erik as long as you wear it no mirror can ever show you the face again

he was silent then and when i showed him the new mask he accepted it without question and put it on hastily with his clumsy bandaged fingers but when i stood up to go he reacted with panic and clutched at my grown

dont go dont leave me here in the dark

you are not in the dark i said patiently look i have left the candle

but i knew as i looked at him that it would have made no difference if i had left him fifty candles the darkness he feared was in his own mind and there was no light in the universe powerful enough to take that darkness from him

with a sigh of resignation i sat back on the bed and began to sing softly and before i had finished the first verse he was asleep

the bandages on his hands and wrists showed white and eerie in the candlelight as i eased my skirts from his grasp

i knew that marie was right

physically and mentally i had scarred him for life

their daughter scrunched up her hands and legs waving them wildly in the air he opened his palm allowing the babe to kick his hand

is she like a puppy

constance choked what

he looked up will she get her spots later

laughter bubbled up from within her as she playfully whacked him on the shoulder

a delicious twodimple grin spread across his face

good i find im rather partial to freckled redheads

drews expression softened ah nellie hes bald pink and has no teeth whats so beautiful about that

nellies laugh tinkled out like musical chimes while she covered the babe back up

one of drews dimples kicked in as he draped an arm about grandmas shoulder

ah god lys he breathed and she opened her eyes to look up at him she was the love of his heart his true partner in both work and life and the idea of losing her to the violence of the world they lived in scared the living shit out of him

but her smile lit her eyes her face and he pushed the darkness away and let himself grin back at her like the damn fool that he was this momentnowwas perfect and he wasnt going to let his fears interfere

he must have seen her shock because he said you cant defeat the power of the book but you can make it work for you

chris just watches but he cant keep his mouth shut for long excellent everyone is serving me im glad you guys have finally figured out how it should benow you just need to convince the world

you remarked once in a fit of pique you had made me famous you were wrong my dear you have made me

he grinned jealous

i wait with some impatience in my pulse but no doubt in my breast

its not a romance its a love story

love isnt something you take from one to give to another love is to be shared among all the more people we have in our family the more love there will be to share

but as ana pulled away on a westbound highway with a werewolf riding shotgun and her thirst for blood calling yet again she had this thought maybe a misfit could never be normal no matter how badly it wanted to

with that i took a deep breath and leapt spreading my arms pretending i could fly

my dearest breena

my heart for unknown reasons seems to freeze in motion in my chest i can see he senses it and he holds his pause to enjoy my suffering prolonging my ignorance viktor what

because in some other universe you are me i am you and we are perfectly happy together or perhaps not… and just like this…

there ought to be a law that allows eavesdroppers to sue

i could change your mind zach said surprising the hell out of them both why would he take something as simple as this banter as a challenge i dont know that i want to but i feel right sure i could

how arrogant how typically male

i suppose he shrugged and reached for the wine bottle more

she nodded frowning now how do you know you could change my mind its been a long time since you well—

over two years the pain was there an ache in his chest he imagined he would feel every time he thought of hannah

and he thought of her every day dreamed of her about as often but lately maybe only in the past week hed begun to realize that his life had not ended with his wifes

he either had to die or start living again

the northern star changes its position every ten thousand years but friendships can last for all eternity

with no sense of smell your memories dropped like pennies out of a ripped pocket until the past was ashes and your parents were blanks nothing more than the holes in swiss cheese

devon hamiltonzemaitis was a beautiful woman being dead didnt change that

a first kiss is the demarcation line the same information that a moment ago felt private all of a suddens seems unfair to withhold and with that exchange came more

i will be so glad for you to hear not the sounds of gunfire but the sounds of church bells and of people working in peace

why dont you check out those teenagers in the middle row theyve been going at it like dogs in heat ever since the previews theyre probably both werewolves and even if they arent you should throw them out on principle alone

kevin had been born to make love to a man the same way i had

the first kiss is never just a kiss but a beautiful place you get to go only once

brick walls towered over her decrepit staircases crowded about her nothing had changed the line there the lessons there the rape there shouldnt the place be crimson with blood and black with shame

she raised her head and saw a squadron of fighter planes she stretched her hand high as if she could grab hold and climb away from what she had done from who she was

are you lovers

do you mind my asking you

its off the record

because i would like to ask you to dinner

i tell you all the time you will never be able to replace me with a brass and steam contraption

i cant i wwant yyou my own fucking twin

looking back at him was a man who was battered and broken

and alive for the first time in his life

he grinned a very dark and evil grin… the kind of grin that the grinch had before he stole christmas

enough with the sadness this dream is not for crybabies he said his face beaming with a wide smile

he wanted to die he prayed for it through the roar in his ears he begged for it

all i knew was my father was famous for being a loser and a loser that wanted nothing to do with me since the day i was born

i the great and powerful ds will create a harem for all the women in the world for a woman no greater joy exists in the entire universe than to fuck me the ultimate sex symbol

for a moment she believed he had left but as she shifted away from the wall she sensed him there beside the bed he was very close

but she would fight it and not look

viktor the accented voice bellowed from below and then the shadow was gone

darkness overwhelmed her then and carried her away to a land of crows and mocking strangers

caine was a murderer a liar a cad a skulker in shadows and a heartless wretch what sort of woman or god would love someone like him

lately i’ve wished for a lot of things to be the way they were gone are my lust

for the macabre and the sweetly sinful fantasies of meeting a vampire something

crimson made it less sexy

i am  and you are  i know you are the best to be loved by everyone

‘i do understand’ said zoran ‘it was same for me with mrs zoran when i first meet her but the feeling goes away after few hours

he heard the voice that had called to him in dreams had saved him from the sands and from following his brother into the river

so you see the man really loved her

the tiger

were you born with all your organs intact he responds

i can’t see his face so i have no way of knowing where he’s going with this question

good he responds then i expect you to use the one beneath your skull

oh then don’t you want to… she trailed off a blush rising

are you kidding me more than anything his expression softened but maira i don’t want to rush you make you do something you aren’t ready for

she stared at him he was so pretty was he also stonecold stupid

how could he think she wasn’t ready for it she’d already thrown herself at him twice now if he counted the kitchen disaster

was she on some sort of candid camera version of this is your sucky love life

lilies bloom when we laugh together

fragment from utopia chapter hope

i am strange

the person they truly are

i should have been bolder and kissed her at the end i should have been more cautious i had talked too much i had said too little

we fell asleep as lovers do listening to the raindrops pitterpatter on the old tin roof hands entwined and souls secretly smiling

i still wouldn’t be close enough to you

and so in silence we walked the surface of a dying world but in the breast of one of us at least had been born that which is ever oldest yet ever new

petey samson gave the ladies an overtheshoulder glance he realized no doggie treat was forthcoming even from isabel who was usually the soft mark to hit up he scratched his front claws to reattack the sand

in the roughness

of his stubble

the tenderest love

never surrender to youre passions dream and live to excess

well done darren master byron was full of praise for the prince what did you use to cast it

darren’s eyes found mine something i don’t regret

love is one of those topics that plenty of people try to write about but not enough try to do

i want to be able to love you more than i fear losing you and i don’t know how

but there’s a part of me that wonders what it would be like to be the most important person to someone else to always feel like you were missing a piece of yourself when he wasn’t near you

i couldnt have gotten through any of this without you through all of it youve been my support my anchor i dont know how one mans shoulders can possibly be so strong

he tilted her face up to his with the love i feel for you bella i could lift up the world

i married a man who was as much a part of me as my own soul

isn’t that what true romance is supposed to be about finding the person who’s your soul mate someone you dream about at nightsomeone whose name is on your lips when you wake up in the morning

the day you were born the angels whispered she is going to love him until the day she dies

prayer is an insurance policy that you can never lapse on

i realize that i quite like this girl it’s not just that she’s so pretty the words fly out of my mind before they can leave my mouth—it’s that when we’re chatting i feel like i’ve known her all my life

and me standing under the splintered night

catching fractured glimpses into the black behind the black

i believe that life always has a way of surprising you for better or for worse he looks at me once more his eyes holding mine captive in its strong hold and that you always have a choice as to how the story ends

keeping the box closed just keeps you in the dark not the universe but failing to open the box doesnt kill the cat

the idea that life contains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written

so that’s it you’re just going to rescue me and go

but thats what it meant to love a military man

gretchen clint said his voice full of the same luscious agony gretchen felt building inside of her im going to kiss you

he was giving her one last chance to back out to push him away that was not going to happen

her mouth twisted with amusement not if i kiss you first

the house was the color of baby vomit

what hans had intended to end at a simple kiss quickly escalated into something neither one of them seemed able to stop

i’d lick you numb mariah you have no idea the things i’m capable of

thank god hes holding me because if he werent id float away

i think you better hurry along with that french toast making stud you know—before my fetus eats your face

it would be equally as delicious

my head is in a world of hurt my apartment is trashed at the end of today i could either be dating the girl who saves my family’s future or is going to be the ending of it when did life get so damn complicated

for the love of mercy i cannot walk into mediation with a swollen vagina cash please

an artist if you’d really like to know who’s fucking your wife

i want to have an affair

i think only when you are truly alone can you see you never were

he’d pushed it back where he’d kept the thought for weeks but it wouldn’t stay wouldn’t stop wouldn’t let him go

her eyes began to shimmer with tears you    you love me

romance only comes into existence where love is fatal frowned upon and doomed by life itself

he was so much more than she had expected more than a delicious body and a smile that came out of nowhere to light up the darkness of this hopeless place

i am an acquired taste

by morning you wont remember his name and you wont want to forget mine vinter

with an evil tempting wink that threatened to undo him she added im the one you have to watch out for

everyone wanted me to be the bad boy the label wanted it the publicists wanted it but i was just trying to be myself

it doesn’t matter what’s wrong with him we’re not going to act like he doesn’t exist not anymore

this is my heart on crack robin when she sees creek

im sorry i really did want to talk to you his free hand went to her face and cupped her cheek

something tightened pleasantly in her belly just talk she breathed

he nodded but used their clasped hands to pull her closer to him

she raised her head and met his eyes a storm of blue and green she smirked thats a shame

but something about clint tossed off sparks that set her nerves on fire

be quiet or i swear to god ill take you right here

yes this was definitely forced sex

ceremonythe wine of human existence  morris r cohen

she turned her painted blue eyes toward the assistant and said something in french before she left

love like fortune favours the bold

and then i broke away so i asked as if i got kissed like that all the time which believe me i dont where is it youre taking me again

the tombs

he looked at me with serious eyes but not the kind that made me wonder what i’d done wrong the kind that made me wonder what i’d done right

i gasped and pointed the way i gave you an adventure ed right in front of you but you never saw it until i showed you and thats why we broke up

one as deformed and horrible as myself could not deny herself to me my companion must be of the same species and have the same defects with whom i can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being

webb looked at his sister grinning why cant you narnie

fitz leaned his head on narnies shoulder and ill be your queen

you can be the eunuch jude said shoving him out of the way and ill be her prince he bowed and took narnies hand kissing it and their eyes met it was awkward for a moment until narnie looked away

the slowest kiss makes too much haste

you could make me say it again he whispered make me say it always make me say it so often that you never have cause to doubt i love you

i dont do romance in the same way i dont do heroin russian roulette or nude alligator wrestling i consider all of the above selfdestructive and demeaning and these are things up with which i will not put

offering you oranges for the peeling

knife glistening in the sun

humid nights the way honey

roger said i dont know about having a shrink around all the time are you analyzing me right now

sophie rolled her eyes how original no im not analyzing you itd take a whole team of shrinks to figure out your crazy ass and i simply dont have the time or energy

and that was when she hit him

it wasnt a faint slap on the cheek no alexandra put all her weight behind the right hook that landed squarely across his jaw throwing him completely off balance

without hesitation but with a sense of entitlement he lifted my hand to his lips he was gentlemenlike in every way i don’t know why i wondered if it was an act or for real

there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection

emily swore and he was impressed hed never thought to string cocksuckingsonofabitch together in one sentence he couldnt help himself the snort of laughter escaped before he could hold it in

necessity is the mother of delusion for true love to exist there must be nothing that is necessary to it lovers have to live happily ever after no matter what happens

tyler rounded the hood and opened the door what he asked when she grinned at him youve got a slideoverherehoney seat his eyes crinkled with laughter well what are you doing all the way over there

his scent engulfed me  fresh night air and evergreen i buried my face in the hollow beneath his jaw as he shoved his light into me a terrible force of the sort id never imagined hungry for distraction intoxicating to the point of addiction

it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples

i’ve been asking you to marry me since we met what more do you want

astrid was just lit up with beauty shining blonde ringlets june sky blue eyes slightly furrowed brow always biting back a smile champion diver on the swim team olympic level

i stand before her meeting her eye to eye and nose to nose my head takes a slight bow as i clench my fist i should have just killed you like any other bloodsucking vampire

i should have killed you before i repeated while all i could do is wonder how id ever fallen in love with a monster girl

she wasnt a cowardif she were she would have retreated back into her shell years before and pulled back entirely from life she was a fighter life knocked her down and she coped by getting up and moving on

to have the opportunity to know your parents is to have the opportunity to truly know yourself

i was the silent and ever present figure in your lifebut you i kissed the back of her hand softly and closed my eyes youve always been the meaning of mine

maybe i am everything i knew that i would never be i looked back at jay and smiled

oh heaven and hell stop with the tears given the day sarah had just had the tears were logical but watching her face crumple hearing the gutdeep harsh sobs filled rukh with an irrational need to pull her into his arms wrap her in a hug

as soon as the urge had gelled into conscious thought his essence hardened into visibility and his arms slid up around her shivering wet body

sarah’s eyes popped open and she staggered back with a yell

his arms tightened around her steadying her keeping her close well shit at least she’d stopped

fearbright green eyes stared at him instead

given he was an assassin sent to kill her her response was natural even intelligent yet bitterness churned in his gut at the thought of her fearing him

it’s okay he whispered you’re safe

am i hallucinating her question came out as a croak

yes yes you are that seemed a much better answer than the truth

she pinned him with her dark direct gaze you’re just a figment of my imagination a fantasy

yes he didn’t dare move

then why are you still wearing clothes

so leola thought that a modest romance with a hero in embryo could do no harm  might even be a patriotic duty

…deceitful she decided with a little bounce of fury that briefly ballooned the silk of her trousers there you deceitful …

those are all the same words gill—

now look what you’ve done she accused tearfully and bolted from the room

how dare you what is your name i shall make it a sin to be spoken

wait for me

if his voice was just a bit hoarse she didn’t seem to take note of it she looked at him as though he had reached over and slapped her you don’t trust me after all that talk of taking me for my word—

this isn’t about trust

that is precisely what this is about her fingers fisted in her skirts because i’ve trusted you

it hurt him to hear it he didn’t know what else to do he had no contacts left he was walking around now like a blind man he didn’t need the added weight of her safety on his conscience

caine’s eyes fell away again maybe you shouldn’t

caine might have smiled at her had his heart not been breaking to smithereens inside of him

what is it

you have to promise youll never leave me

he’d thought it would be the right thing to say but she scoffed a little… and that more than anything—more than the prospect of having his ribs crushed in or his face pulled off or his neck stretched on a rope—scared him out of his wits

excuse me she said her voice tight but if i’d known there was going to be a firearms examination at the end of the kidnapping by god i would have studied for it

oh lord why was she doomed to adore a man steeped in blindness and utter stupidity

she’d never known a man whose initial move was to undress the woman he wanted

care for her he was unworthy of such a gift unworthy of her blind trust and her sparkling slightly crooked smiles let alone her heart but he wanted her selfish fool he was and had always been care for her ah god she consumed him

somehow i did not finger you for a treasurehunter

oh but i am without shame her name is titianni aziz

he felt rather than saw her chin lift toward him but instead of pulling her hand from his grip and turning away she tightened her own fingers and unceremoniously unexpectedly threw herself down the incline dragging him with her

dragging him with her

my name sir is virgilia wessex i am a sunday school teacher from sussex england and i have given you no leave to address me as anything

his mouth seemed to almost smile but if so he caught it just on the brink and decided against it well i’ve just given the gent who found you first an obscene amount of money to address you however i please… gillia

southern gentleman he said aside to him in arabic do you wish for me to continue this for you

i like the way you kissa couple of test kisses then a huge kiss

jenny was struck again by the contrast between his attractiveness and his shyness it was endearing

it’s not that i don’t like it it’s just… his eyes dropped from hers again almost as if

jenny looked at him sharply as an idea occurred to her could the nordic god be shy

i know theres a word called miracle but i dont know if theres a meaning inside the word miracle

elenas hair turned blue

karl stared at her blankly his throat went dry he felt like a total dickhead but writing really wasnt his strong point so he went for humour instead and flashed her a grin

i was going to write that all your clothes fall off but figured you may have a problem with that this was the second thing that came to mind

a sudden vision fraught with malevolence and darkness obscured her sight the face of a menacing figure turned from the shadows of his grisly handiwork and stared at sorcha

her muscles tensed by the goddess could he see her

please no

she wanted to scream to run but the vision ensnared her into the horrific moment like a fly in a spiders web

i think its your bosoms rand surveyed him critically the dress wouldnt be as tight if they werent so large i think your bosoms are too big

alexei looked down at his overstuffed chest can bosoms ever be too big

nicholasam i dead

an odd question but then she rememberd her mourning attire no sir you are not

he relaxed a moment then turned his head slightly as if searching for other passengers his brows dived in a scowl

am i married

she wasnt sure how to answer his kid gloves hid any evidence of his matrimonial state but his expression of instantaneous alarm and regret suggested he was referring specifically to her

no sir we are not

everybody has flaws but your characteristics are so amazing  that it overpowers everything you are a work of art truly beautiful

darcy why do you suppose she decided to come back…after all this time i mean

i miss you greatly dear the nicest time of day is when i write to you you have a stormier time than i do but i miss you as much i think    please keep most of your heart in washington as long as i’m here for most of mine is with you

she was beautiful all riled up his heart was going a little crazy and all at once he felt very much alive maybe this vacation thing wasnt going to be so bad

he wasnt going to get caught staring at her and reveal that she had the upper hand

i loved her while she was alive but i think i fell in love with her after she died

with me it is quite stark i miss you even more than i could have believed and i was prepared to miss you a good deal

tho i long for the actual sunlight contact between us i miss you like a home shine back honey  think of me

hes going to break my heart again the writing isnt just on the wall its inked into my soul

he turns me inside out with a look destroys me with a kiss

i can see something in his eyes something powerful and terrible and allconsuming

nothing to do but admit that—obnoxious smirk or not—this boy is sexy af a little wicked a lot wild and all dangerous

i’ll marry you tom told her any time any terms

west gently nudged cassandra toward the door go darling while i talk with the insane man

honey hes not worth it no matter how much money hes got not matter how big a ring he puts on your finger if he puts his hands on you you should run the opposite way as fast as you can

you’ll go to hell for this she slurred

you forget princess—he brushed his thumb over her cheek—i’m already on the list of permanent residents

the scars should make you terrifying but to me they don’t they only make you intriguing it’s beauty with depth

he was the villain in all this and when all was said and done she’d hate him for it of that he was certain

make no mistake princess i’m no hero

audrey let out a breath turned the truck around and didn’t look back—except once a famous movie star was waving her goodbye

ruhi blushed she had a peculiar way of being

embarrassed she would restrain a smile and look at my wrist or my ring or my sleeves or my shirt collar  just about any place that would keep her gaze away from my eyes

the greatest gift you can give your romantic relationship is to become emotionally buoyant

dont laugh

why does that phrase always bring out a smile

the world in which deception lives like romance cannot grow with innovation

she was probably mentally calculating all the sins he’d just admitted and storing them for later use when she wanted to fight off his romantic attentions that would be ammunition to throw back in his face

romance is an open book

trinity to fang chapter

your male desperately wants to have children with you she whispered his marking scent was strongly advertising his potent fertility back there

annika to wraith chapter

fang to wraith chapter

the stars shine a little brighter when i tell them about you

theres no romance here but what you may have brought with you

lily is my woman

and the man who took her will burn in hell for his mistake

it was more romantic to say nothing and drinking deep in secret of romance she was as little disposed to ask    advice as she would have been to close that rare volume forever

the most beautiful thing in the world

‘and i will say the same again’ i said

it’s weird how you have no idea how far you’ve come until suddenly you can’t find the way back

i’d do anything to be inside you right now

man this is the world’s worst workout program the drag your own butter

i thought you were a jerk

he shook with an unexpected burst of laughter i know he squeezed her tight trying to figure out how to keep her alive i know

i eat to survive he said matteroffactly

she opened her mouth then shut it was it sad to eat for survival that was exactly what they were doing right here and the pleasure of it was almost blinding

he rose come here

like a moth to a flame mesmerized or hypnotized or something angel went to him giving herself up to ford cooper’s ephemeral net

he moved in set his chin on her shoulder and whispered i can’t…

when he didn’t go on she turned a little to the right enough to put the tips of their noses together can’t what

can’t stop wanting you

you feel a loss of control

never… never had control to begin with

you are my addiction

you are my muse

my worst distraction

my poetry  hues

i wrapped my arms around him threading my fingers through his hair wanting to be as close as humanly possible to this person i loved so much

he’d touched her felt her skin seen her pleasure and it scared the living hell out of him she’d burn him if she got too close and he wasn’t sure he’d survive it

everywhere i go you catch up to me everywhere i run i keep seeing you every time you happen to me all over again

love that doesnt turn you stupid is no love

she kept her eyes shut savoring every ounce of him i just want to stay here like this forever

feelings dont develop this deeply for someone you just met and yet here i am

staying safe might be the best option especially if he contacted you in the midst of danger because of that you either mean a whole lot to him or nothing at all

maybe that was just the way love went—it was something that happened to you and the best preparation you could hope for was the chance to take a deep breath before the wave of it crashed above you and you were in over your head

clearly you were never meant to be a harem girl at all he said lightly running his thumb over the tattoo on her left arm you were meant to be a sea captain

i… i do not think that… gentlemen do this sort of thing her pulse raced with excitement and anticipation only scoundrels

you might want to hold tight to the arms of the chair

that was the last warning he offered before he bent his head…

she said that if you can’t see yourself being happy with someone for the rest of your life if you know he won’t treat you well if you have to change him to meet your standards then he isn’t the one

and the rain makes a kind of curtain which is probably for the best because all of a sudden im leaning over the gear stick and my hands are on his shoulders and im trying to keep breathing

and so he daydreamed about what it would be like to gaze into her eyes and feel her whisper ‘forever and always’ into his soul beneath a bronze sunset while ambient waves crash upon the shore like a lullaby that soothes him off to sleep

for me it feels like… i don’t know like the sun after a storm maybe for so long it seemed like it wasn’t there but when the clouds pass the sun just covers everything warms everything that’s how i think it feels for me

she once told me that she stalks me day and night

she has me in her feelings and in her sight

her heart keeps telling me things in the night that she is afraid to tell me in daylight

my heart know that she loves me

but life is strange and we never know where two people will end up next

love and soul are not to behold

her eyes speak in unknown words

and we continue to drift sometimes nearer

and sometimes apart

i find myself somehow different

my eyes running in his presence

his walk as if he was drunk

neither day nor night the moments were somewhere tonight

still unknown where his soul was

just thinking about him today onwards

my soul says he needs me

in my absence he cries behind me

my presence makes him peaceful

as if i remain in his soul

till my heart the love is tied

his eyes unfolding every lies

say my friends are we made for life

she once told me that she stalks me day and night

she has me in her feelings and in her sight

her heart keeps telling me things in the night that she is afraid to tell me in daylight

my heart know that she loves me

but life is strange and we never know where two people will end up next

love and soul are not to behold

her eyes speak in unknown words

and we continue to drift sometimes nearer

and sometimes apart

then we kiss underneath the glow of dozens of lightbulbs shimmering in a tree and for just this moment my world is a fairy tale
