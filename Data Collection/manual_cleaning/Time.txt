time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time

i wish it need not have happened in my time said frodo

so do i said gandalf and so do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us

there comes a time when the world gets quiet and the only thing left is your own heart so youd better learn the sound of it otherwise youll never understand what its saying

time flies like an arrow fruit flies like a banana

it has been said time heals all wounds i do not agree the wounds remain in time the mind protecting its sanity covers them with scar tissue and the pain lessens but it is never gone

books have a unique way of stopping time in a particular moment and saying let’s not forget this

how did it get so late so soon

it is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important

dont waste your time with explanations people only hear what they want to hear

yesterday is gone tomorrow has not yet come we have only today let us begin

don’t waste your time in anger regrets worries and grudges life is too short to be unhappy

you can have it all just not all at once

dont spend time beating on a wall hoping to transform it into a door

time is the longest distance between two places

top  things money can’t buy

they always say time changes things but you actually have to change them yourself

they say im oldfashioned and live in the past but sometimes i think progress progresses too fast

they say time heals all wounds but that presumes the source of the grief is finite

a man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life

time doesn’t heal emotional pain you need to learn how to let go

this is a new year a new beginning and things will change

i sit beside the fire and think

of all that i have seen

of meadow flowers and butterflies

in summers that have been

of yellow leaves and gossamer

in autumns that there were

with morning mist and silver sun

and wind upon my hair

i sit beside the fire and think

of how the world will be

when winter comes without a spring

that i shall ever see

for still there are so many things

that i have never seen

there is a different green

i sit beside the fire and think

and people that will see a world

that i shall never know

but all the while i sit and think

of times there were before

and voices at the door

scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real

unfortunately the clock is ticking the hours are going by the past increases the future recedes possibilities decreasing regrets mounting

here we are trapped in the amber of the moment there is no why

its hard being left behind  its hard to be the one who stays

time is a created thing to say i dont have time is like saying i dont want to

time is an illusion

those who make the worst use of their time are the first to complain of its brevity

you may delay but time will not

the past is never dead its not even past

the timeless in you is aware of lifes timelessness and knows that yesterday is but todays memory and tomorrow is todays dream

theres never enough time to do all the nothing you want

it’s dark now and i am very tired i love you always time is nothing

time is a game played beautifully by children

one day spent with someone you love can change everything

being with you and not being with you is the only way i have to measure time

it is by no means an irrational fancy that in a future existence we shall look upon what we think our present existence as a dream

how did it get so late so soon its night before its afternoon december is here before its june my goodness how the time has flewn how did it get so late so soon

time takes it all whether you want it to or not

time is what we want mostbut what we use worst

the future is uncertain but the end is always near

a man must dream a long time in order to act with grandeur and dreaming is nursed in darkness

my past is everything i failed to be

i have no faith in human perfectibility i think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity man is now only more active  not more happy  nor more wise than he was  years ago

for a while is a phrase whose length cant be measuredat least by the person whos waiting

the strongest of all warriors are these two — time and patience

spring passes and one remembers ones innocence

summer passes and one remembers ones exuberance

autumn passes and one remembers ones reverence

winter passes and one remembers ones perseverance

there are memories that time does not erase forever does not make loss forgettable only bearable

muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone

as if you could kill time without injuring eternity

three oclock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do

time doesnt take away from friendship nor does separation

time can be a greedy thingsometimes it steals the details for itself

time is what keeps everything from happening at once

all photographs are memento mori to take a photograph is to participate in another person’s or thing’s mortality vulnerability mutability precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it all photographs testify to time’s relentless melt

im not much but im all i have

the future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour whatever he does whoever he is

there are moments when i wish i could roll back the clock and take all the sadness away but i have the feeling that if i did the joy would be gone as well

until you value yourself you wont value your time until you value your time you will not do anything with it

the three rules of the librarians of time and space are  silence  books must be returned no later than the last date shown and  do not interfere with the nature of causality

she wanted none of those days to end and it was always with disappointment that she watched the darkness stride forward

there is more to life than simply increasing its speed

and therein lies the whole of mans plight human time does not turn in a circle it runs ahead in a straight line that is why man cannot be happy happiness is the longing for repetition

the future came and went in the mildly discouraging way that futures do

time is a slippery thing lose hold of it once and its string might sail out of your hands forever

the cost of a thing is the amount of what i will call life which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run

its worth making time to find the things that really stir your soul that’s what makes you really feel alive you have to say ‘no’ to other things you’re used to and do it with all your heart

lost time is never found again

i am haunted by waters

there will be time there will be time

to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet

never waste a minute thinking about people you dont like

time spent with a cat is never wasted

there is no time for cutanddried monotony there is time for work and time for love that leaves no other time

only time can heal your broken heart just as only time can heal his broken arms and legs

it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy—it is disposition alone seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others

the future starts today not tomorrow

the moving finger writes and having writ

moves on nor all thy piety nor wit

shall lure it back to cancel half a line

nor all thy tears wash out a word of it

fantasy if its really convincing cant become dated for the simple reason that it represents a flight into a dimension that lies beyond the reach of time

i give you this to take with you

nothing remains as it was if you know this you can

begin again with pure joy in the uprooting

enjoy life theres plenty of time to be dead

i always felt like i was meant to have been born in another era another time

i have realized that the past and future are real illusions that they exist in the present which is what there is and all there is

clocks slay time time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels only when the clock stops does time come to life

life is short focus on what really matters most you have to change your priorities over time

the past is a ghost the future a dream and all we ever have is now

punctuality is the thief of time

don’t worry if people think you’re crazy you are crazy you have that kind of intoxicating insanity that lets other people dream outside of the lines and become who they’re destined to be

you will never find time for anything if you want time you must make it

it is looking at things for a long time that ripens you and gives you a deeper meaning

inelegantly and without my consent time passed

rest is not idleness and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summers day listening to the murmur of the water or watching the clouds float across the sky is by no means a waste of time

the universe is very very big

it also loves a paradox for example it has some extremely strict rules

not you or your family or your house or your planet or the sun it is an absolute rule therefore when someone says that their love will never die it means that their love is not real for everything that is real dies

theres no advantage to hurrying through life shikamaru nara

with endless time nothing is special with no loss or sacrifice we can’t appreciate what we have

determine never to be idle no person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing

times the thief of memory

five minutes are enough to dream a whole life that is how relative time is

time is precious but truth is more precious than time

the wisest are the most annoyed at the loss of time

it is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much  the life we receive is not short but we make it so we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully

the chief beauty about time

is that you cannot waste it in advance

the next year the next day the next hour are lying ready for you

as perfect as unspoiled

as if you had never wasted or misapplied

a single moment in all your life

you can turn over a new leaf every hour

if you choose

but the you who you are tonight is the same you i was in love with yesterday the same you i’ll be in love with tomorrow

everything takes time bees have to move very fast to stay still

time will explain

but if you come at just any time i shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you

the best things are never arrived at in haste god is in no hurry his plans are never rushed

time that withers you will wither me we will fall like ripe fruit and roll down the grass together dear friend let me lie beside you watching the clouds until the earth covers us and we are gone

if you have the woman you love what more do you need well besides an alibi for the time of her husband’s murder

you need to make time for your family no matter what happens in your life

id like to get away from earth awhile

and then come back to it and begin over

may no fate wilfully misunderstand me

and half grant what i wish and snatch me away

not to return earths the right place for love

i dont know where its likely to go better

life is a funny thing we only get so many years to live it so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be we shouldnt waste time on things that might happen someday or maybe even never

eternity is in love with the productions of time

time is not the great teacher experience is a man may live a whole life but if he never leaves his home to experience that life he dies knowing nothing a mere child who has suffered and lived can be the wiser of the two

the tired sunsets and the tired

it takes a lifetime to die and

no time at

all

time is a gift given to you given to give you the time you need the time you need to have the time of your life

when you are measuring life you are not living it

do not wait the time will never be just right start where you stand and work whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be found as you go along

its such a shame to waste time we always think we have so much of it

everything changed the day she figured out there was exactly enough time for the important things in her life

months are different in college especially freshman year too much happens every freshman month equals six regular months—theyre like dog months

i want to be the best version of myself for anyone who is going to someday walk into my life and need someone to love them beyond reason

the writers curse is that even in solitude no matter its duration he never grows lonely or bored

real museums are places where time is transformed into space

time moves slowly but passes quickly

time has no meaning

love will endure

time is too slow for those who wait too swift for those who fear too long for those who grieve too short for those who rejoice but for those who love time is eternity

a man is the sum of his misfortunes one day youd think misfortune would get tired but then time is your misfortune

there are things that will never change things we will carry along with us always but as we venture into the murky future we must find our strength by learning to leave things behind

the main problem with this great obsession for saving time is very simple you cant save time you can only spend it but you can spend it wisely or foolishly

time heals all wounds but not this one not yet

a revolution is not a bed of roses a revolution is a struggle between the future and the past

the best use of life is love the best expression of love is time the best time to love is now

…the sad part is that i will probably end up loving you without you for much longer than i loved you when i knew you

some people might find that strange

but the truth of it is that the amount of love you feel for someone and the impact they have on you as a person is in no way relative to the amount of time you have known them

realize deeply that the present moment is all you will ever have

but i was young

and didn’t know better

and someone should have told me to capture every second

because now i’m sitting here alone and it’s getting really hard to breath because tears are growing in my throat and they want to break out but there are people

and i just want to be somewhere silent

but still i don’t want to be alone because i’m scared and lonely

and i don’t understand

because i was alone my whole life

my whole life

i was so damn lonely and i was content with that

because i liked myself and my own company

and i didn’t need anyone

but then there was you

so someone should have told me that love is for those few brave who can handle the unbearable emptiness

the unbearable guilt and lack of oneself

because i lost myself to someone i love

and i might get myself back one day

but it will take time it will take time

this is gonna take some time

i wish someone would have told me this

someone should have told me this

time is the most valuable thing that a man can spend

august rain the best of the summer gone and the new fall not yet born the odd uneven time

i am almost a hundred years old waiting for the end and thinking about the beginning

there are things i need to tell you but would you listen if i told you how quickly time passes

i know you are unable to imagine this

time present and time past

are both perhaps present in time future

and time future contained in time past

and meanwhile time goes about its immemorial work of making everyone look and feel like shit

time moves in one direction memory another we are that strange species that constructs artifacts intended to counter the natural flow of forgetting

nothing endures but change

anyone who isnt embarrassed of who they were last year probably isnt learning enough

aside from velcro time is the most mysterious substance in the universe you cant see it or touch it yet a plumber can charge you upwards of seventyfive dollars per hour for it without necessarily fixing anything

but these things don’t matter at all because once you are real you can’t be ugly except to people who don’t understand

better three hours too soon than a minute too late

time expands then contracts all in tune with the stirrings of the heart

ill come and make love to you at five oclock if im late start without me

time is more precious than gold more precious than diamonds more precious than oil or any valuable treasures it is time that we do not have enough of it is time that causes the war within our hearts and so we must spend it wisely

everyday is a bank account and time is our currency no one is rich no one is poor weve got  hours each

life is short focus on what really matters most you should change your priorities over time

how much sweeter life would be if it all happened in reverse if after decades of disappointments you finally arrived at an age when you had conceded nothing when everything was possible

where your attention goes your time goes

time management is about life management

suspect each moment for it is a thief tiptoeing away with more than it brings

beauty is not who you are on the outside it is the wisdom and time you gave away to save another struggling soul like you

i wasted time and now doth time waste me

the lyf so short the craft so long to lerne

it’s always about timing if it’s too soon no one understands if it’s too late everyone’s forgotten

your hand can seize today but not tomorrow and thoughts of your tomorrow are nothing but desire don’t waste this breath if your heart isn’t crazy since the rest of your life won’t last forever

its paradoxical that the idea of living a long life appeals to everyone but the idea of getting old doesnt appeal to anyone

time’s a goon right you gonna let that goon push you around scotty shook his head the goon won

its funny how one can look back on a sorrow one thought one might well die of at the time and know that one had not yet reckoned the tenth part of true grief

i met a boy whose eyes showed me that the past present and future were all the same thing

i wake up and i see the face of the devil and i ask him what time is it

and he says

how much time do you want

history isnt the lies of the victors as i once glibly assured old joe hunt i know that now its more the memories of the survivors most of whom are neither victorious or defeated

do not whine do not complain work harder spend more time alone

its funny no matter how hard you try you cant close your heart forever and the minute you open it up you never know whats going to come in but when it does you just have to go for it because if you dont theres not point in being here

maybe reading was just a way to make her feel less alone to keep her company when you read something you are stopped the moment is stayed you can sometimes be there more fully than you can in your real life

in the vastness of space and the immensity of time it is my joy to share a planet and an epoch with annie

dedication to sagans wife ann druyan in cosmos

no people whose word for yesterday is the same as their word for tomorrow can be said to have a firm grip on the time

they won’t be here for long

they still choose to live

their brightest lives

we are all migrants through time

there is no present or futureonly the past happening over and over againnow

modern man thinks he loses something—time—when he does not do things quickly yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains—except kill it

time and i have quarrelled all hours are midnight now i had a clock and a watch but i destroyed them both i could not bear the way they mocked me

time goes faster the more hollow it is lives with no meaning go straight past you like trains that don’t stop at your station

im wishing he could see that music lives forever that its stronger than death stronger than time and that its strength holds you together when nothing else can

thank you for sending me a copy of your book ill waste no time reading it

you cant stop time you cant capture light you can only turn your face up and let it rain down

the years teach much the days never know

time doesn’t heal all wounds we both know that’s bullshit it comes from people who have nothing comforting or original to say

even a broken clock is right twice a day

any time not spent on love is wasted

you forget time doesnt exist anymore you gave it to me

the memory of everything is very soon overwhelmed in time

tell me he said what is this thing about time why is it better to be late than early people are always saying we must wait we must wait what are they waiting for

well … i guess people wait in order to make sure of what they feel

and when you have waited—has it made you sure

the worst pain  isnt the pain you feel at the time its the pain you feel later on when theres nothing you can do about it they say that time heals all wounds but we never live long enough to test that theory

when my eyes meet his gaze as were sitting here staring at each other time stops those eyes are piercing mine and i can swear at this moment he senses the real me the one without the attitude without the facade

the right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have

and yet it takes only the smallest pleasure or pain to teach us time’s malleability

they give birth astride of a grave the light gleams an instant then its night once more

eternity is said not to be an extension of time but an absence of time and sometimes it seemed to me that her abandonment touched that strange mathematical point of endlessness a point with no width occupying no space

time flows in strange ways on sundays and sights become mysteriously distorted

we know one another this is the present there is no past and no future here i am washing my hands and the cracked mirror shows me to myself suspended as it were in time this is me this moment will not pass

and then i open the door and go to the diningroom where he is sitting waiting for me at a table and i think how in that moment i have aged and passed on how i have advanced one step towards an unknown destiny

we smile we choose our lunch we speak of this and that but  i say to myselfi am not she who left him five minutes ago she has stayed behind i am another woman older more mature…

there is a time for work and a time for love that leaves no other time

how soon hath time the subtle thief of youth

stoln on his wing my threeandtwentieth year

nox didn’t say a word he waited counting the seconds in his mind sometimes you counted bullets and sometimes you counted time either one could kill you

you were the one

i wanted most

to stay

but time could not

be kept at bay

the more it goes

the more its gone—

the more it takes away

the common man prays i want a cookie right now and god responds if youd listen to what i say tomorrow it will bring you  cookies

i dont love you like i loved you yesterday

men live their lives trapped in an eternal present between the mists of memory and the sea of shadow that is all we know of the days to come

you never know when the truth will come home you can’t choose the time the time chooses you

as wave is driven by wave

and each pursued pursues the wave ahead

so time flies on and follows flies and follows

always for ever and new what was before

is left behind what never was is now

and every passing moment is renewed

okay this is the wisdom first time spent on reconnaissanse is never wasted second almost anything can be improved with the addition of bacon and finally there is no problem on earth that cant be ameliorated by a hot bath and a cup of tea

theyll say you are bad

or perhaps you are mad

or at least you

should stay undercover

your mind must be bare

if you would dare

to think you can love

more than one lover

stop trying to be less of who you are let this time in your life cut you open and drain all of the things that are holding you back

time has no dominion over love love is the one thing that transcends time bones

love goes through all times

there are two days in my calendar this day and that day

as she’d left i’d glanced at her gun

this time when she’d pointed it at me she’d flicked the safety on if that wasn’t true love i don’t know what was

it was long since i had longed for anything and the effect on me was horrible

this is a wonderful day i have never seen this one before

a thousand years ago five minutes were

equal to forty ounces of fine sand

outstare the stars infinite foretime and

infinite aftertime above your head

they close like giant wings and you are dead

i am not particularly interested in

saving time i prefer to enjoy it

time is more complex near the sea than in any other place for in addition to the circling of the sun and the turning of the seasons the waves beat out the passage of time on the rocks and the tides rise and fall as a great clepsydra

time is a storm in which we are all lost

but that is before it is wound before it begins to tick the pendulum swinging steadily and evenly then then it becomes something else

the changes are slow first the color changes in the face shifts from white to grey and then there are clouds that float across it disappearing when they reach the opposite side

meanwhile bits of the body of the clock expand and contract like pieces of a puzzle as though the clock is falling apart slowly and gracefully

all of this takes hours

after midnight the clock begins once more to fold in upon itself the face lightens and the cloud returns the number of juggled balls decreases until the juggler himself vanishes

by noon it is a clock again and no longer a dream

theres only one day at a time here then its tonight and then tomorrow will be today again

time was such an odd thing one moment you could talk to someone then suddenly they were gone

how you spend your time is more important than how you spend your money money mistakes can be corrected but time is gone forever

lies  there is only the present and nothing to remember

lies  time is a straight line

lies  the difference between the past and the future is that one has happened while the other has not

lies  we can only be in one place at a time

lies  any proposition that contains the word finite the world the universe experience ourselves

lies  reality as something which can be agreed upon

when did you feel your

most euphoric kiss

was i the source

of your greatest bliss

what do ties matter jeeves at a time like this

there is no time sir at which ties do not matter

there was only present and it was infinite the past and the future were just blinders we wore so that infinity wouldnt drive us mad

he shrugs doesnt help to waste my time thinking about wouldvebeens

laila whispers he says to the girl with a mind full of them

we almost always can point to that hundredth blow but we dont always mark the ninetynine other things that happen before we change

its strange how time can make a place shrink make its strangeness ordinary

if time be judiciously employed there is time for everything

later on in life you expect a bit of rest dont you you think you deserve it i did anyway but then you begin to understand that the reward of merit is not lifes business

by the time youre thirty your worst enemy is yourself

the strangeness of time not in its passing which can seem infinite like a tunnel whose end you cant see whose beginning youve forgotten but in the sudden realization that something finite has passed and is irretrievable

lost yesterday somewhere between sunrise and sunset two golden hours each set with sixty diamond minutes no reward is offered for they are gone forever

time is the coin of your life it is the only coin you have and only you can determine how it will be spent be careful lest you let other people spend it for you

the time that leads to mastery is dependent on the intensity of our focus

men have no more time to understand anything they buy readymade things in the shops but since there are no shops where you can buy friends men no longer have any friends

clear thinking at the wrong moment can stifle creativity

time folds you in its arms and gives you one last kiss and then it flattens you out and folds you up and tucks you away until its time for you to become someone elses past time and then time folds again

usually time alters and affects everything but when someone you love dies time cannot change that no amount of time will ever change that so time stops having any meaning

how does she know its the right room wondered descant

oh i dont know mabye its the magical red glow coming from the doorway or perhaps its the deafening howl of the temporal winds said mervall

descant noddedyou could be right brother and dont think i dont know sarcasm when i hear it

sometimes life is a constant battle against the nostalgia of a time that can never be real again

first a warning musical then the hour irrevocable the leaden circles dissolved in the air

has it ever struck you that life is all memory except for the one present moment that goes by you so quick you hardly catch it going

you have made flowers grow where i cultivated dust and stones remember this on this journey you insist on making if you die i will not survive you long

the degree of slowness is directionally proportional to the intensity of memory the degree of speed is directionally proportional to the intensity of forgetting

the proper wise balancing of ones whole life may depend upon the feasibility of a cup of tea at an unusual hour

there was a beautiful time

i dont have time energy or interest in hating the haters im too busy loving the lovers

but nothing warps time quite like childhood

from all that i saw and everywhere i wandered i learned that time cannot be spent it can only be squandered

for after the battle comes quiet

time is the enemy of identity

from space astronauts can see people making love as a tiny speck of light not light exactly but a glow that could be confused for light  a coital radiance that takes generations to pour like honey through the darkness to the astronauts eyes

this thing all things devours

grinds hard stones to meal

and beats high mountain down

an infinity of passion can be contained in one minute like a crowd in a small space

for the present is the point at which time touches eternity

you can find something truly important in an ordinary minute

i can do this… i can start over i can save my own life and i’m never going to be alone as long as i have stars to wish on and people to still love

i didnt pay atteniton to times or distance instead focusing on how it felt just to be in motion knowing it wasnt about the finish line but how i got there that mattered

we love to buy books because we believe were buying the time to read them

inside out vh

want to have a short phone call with someone call them at  am right before lunch theyll talk fast you may think you are interesting but you are not more interesting than lunch

now five years is nothing in a mans life except when he is very young and very old

you never know ahead of time what somethings really going to be like

nothing living should ever be treated with contempt whatever it is that lives a man a tree or a bird should be touched gently because the time is short civilization is another word for respect for life

time has a wonderful way to show us what really matters

fifty years i hackneyed is a long time

not when youre looking back at them she said you wonder how they vanished so quickly

every moment is the paradox of now or never

i hadn’t been a nerd mind you i’d just been the type of guy who spent a lot of time by himself focused entirely on a single consuming interest

if you act like youve only got fifteen minutes it will take all day act like youve got all day it will take fifteen minutes

had we but world enough and time

this coyness lady were no crime

we would sit down and think which way

to walk and pass our long loves day

americans will put up with anything provided it doesnt block traffic

time and death sleep side by side

do you want to be with dave for the rest of your life then he rips off a piece of paper and picks up

the smallest charcoal stick from my set he writes something he passes it over to me

it says

time will tell

and while you’re waiting he says don’t settle for anything less than what you really want

time and tide wait for no man

my heart is burning a hole in my chest and every time you speak to me it keeps sinking and im left with nothing but ashes i wish she were talking to me because the more she speaks to me the more my heart flutters like a rising phoenix

karen quan and jarod kintz

let this time in your life cut you open and drain all of the things that are holding you back i’m going to help you forgive the things that you won’t let yourself forget

pakistan not only means freedom and independence but the muslim ideology which has to be preserved which has come to us as a precious gift and treasure and which we hope other will share with us

if someone loves you they should not be envious of you pouring your heart and soul and time and energy into the things that you are passionate about but insteadthey should love you more because you are so involved in those things

i’ll wait for you to find me again so don’t take too long

it’s how i fill the time when nothing’s happening thinking too much flirting with melancholy

grimly she realized that clocks dont make a sound that even remotely resembles ticking tocking it was more the sound of a hammer upside down hacking methodically at the earth it was the sound of a grave

im trying to remember how you tell the time by looking at the sun i should leave it for a while its too bright to see the numbers at the moment

happy the man and happy he alone

he who can call today his own

he who secure within can say

tomorrow do thy worst for i have lived today

be fair or foul or rain or shine

the joys i have possessed in spite of fate are mine

not heaven itself upon the past has power

but what has been has been and i have had my hour

to them as to magnus time was like rain glittering as it fell changing the world but something that could also be taken for granted

until you loved a mortal then time became gold in a misers hands every bright year counted out carefully infinitely precious and each one slipping through your fingers

we no longer have the luxury of spending our energy on anything that does not lead us and our families to christ

everyones time is limited what matters most is to focus on what matters most

but i have learned that you cant just create your own timetable and will it to come true

men talk of killing time while time quietly kills them

never waste any time you can spend sleeping

writing is not a matter of time but a matter or of space if you dont keep space in your head for writing you wont write even if you have the time

time deals gently only with those who take it gently

if you keep waiting for the right time it may never happen sometimes you have to make the most of the time you have

if we accept time for what it is how it flows and how we flow with it i doubt very much that would continue wasting loads of it by constantly checking our watches

photographs are just light and time

a person that does not value your time will not value your advice

oh shimmer down hunter youre too testy how many times have ive told you that you need to chill out take a vacay disney world is really fun this time of the year you should check it out

maybe the only thing that hints at a sense of time is rhythm not the recurrent beats of the rhythm but the gap between two such beats the gray gap between black beats the tender interval

man…who lives in three places – in the past in the present and in the future – can be unhappy if one of these three is worthless religion has even added a fourth – eternity

time as it grows old teaches all things

man is the result of slow growth that is why he occupies the position he does in animal life what does a pup amount to that has gained its growth in a few days or weeks beside a man who only attains it in as many years

it was a lesson that i would learn in time though it wasnt hegbert who taught me

each day a day goes by

time is a waste of money

there is always time for another last minute

every moment has its pleasures and its hope

its funny dont you think how time seems to do a lot of things it flies it tells and worst of all it runs out

i wasted time and now doth time waste me

for now hath time made me his numbering clock

my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar

their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch

whereto my finger like a dials point

is pointing still in cleansing them from tears

now sir the sound that tells what hour it is

are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart

which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans

show minutes times and hours

but different things can often blend together said the pine tree let me tell you a funny story about pagan rituals

i will come back to you i swear i will

and you will know me still

i shall be only a little taller

i do love the beginning of the summer hols said julian they always seem to stretch out ahead for ages and ages

they go so nice and slowly at first said anne his little sister then they start to gallop

you see this happened a few months ago but its still going on right now and it ought to make us feel ashamed when we talk like we know what were talking about when we talk about love

believing the lie that time will heal all wounds is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us

hide nothing for time which sees all and hears all exposes all

but now we have time endless time stretches before us

in this world there are two times there is mechanical time and there is body time

they do not keep clocks in their houses instead they listen to their heartbeats they feel the rhythms of their moods and desires

witness also that when we talk about literature we do so in the present tense when we speak of the dead we are not so kind

my education was the liberty i had to read indiscriminately and all the time with my eyes hanging out

it hadnt been so long ago yet sometimes she felt that shed been an altogether different person back then

time is a great teacher but unfortunately it kills all its students

time crumbles things everything grows old under the power of time and is forgotten through the lapse of time

time has taught me not to lose hope yet not to trust too much in hope either

it is so many years before one can believe enough in what one feels even to know what the feeling is

about time what i really learned from studying english is time is different with timing

i understand the difference of these two words so well i understand falling in love with the right person in the wrong timing could be the greatest sadness in a persons entire life

people think they own time they have watches and clocks and digital pulses but they are wrong time owns them

the part of life we really live is small for all the rest of existence is not life but merely time

each person who gets stuck in time gets stuck alone

time is the clarity for seeing right and wrong

to the virgins to make much of time

gather ye rosebuds while ye may

old time is still aflying

and this same flower that smiles today

tomorrow will be dying

the glorious lamp of heaven the sun

the higher he’s agetting

the sooner will his race be run

and nearer he is to setting

that age is best which is the first

when youth and blood are warmer

but being spent the worse and worst

times still succeed the former

then be not coy but use your time

and while you may go marry

for having lost but once your prime

you may for ever tarry

writing the art of communicating thoughts to the mind through the eye is the great invention of the worldenabling us to converse with the dead the absent and the unborn at all distances of time and space

why you are a man of heart

sometimes replied phileas fogg quietly when i have the time

put up in a place

where it is easy to see

the cryptic admonishment

ttt

when you feel how depressingly

slowly you climb

its well to remember that

the secret is i say whispering right into his ear that yours was the best kiss i’ve ever had in my life

but i’ve never kissed you he whispers back around us the rain sounds like falling glass not since third grade anyway

i smile but i’m not sure if he can see it

better get started then i say because i don’t have much time

to them as to magnus time was like rain glittering as it fell changing the world but something that could also be taken for granted

by looking far out into space we are also looking far back into time back toward the horizon of the universe back toward the epoch of the big bang

while youll feel compelled to charge forward its often a gentle step back that will reveal to you where you and what you truly seek

we are all the fools of time and terror days

steal on us and steal from us yet we live

loathing our life and dreading still to die

the physician must be able to tell the antecedents know the present and foretell the future — must mediate these things and have two special objects in view with regard to disease namely to do good or to do no harm

there are times when the actual experience of leaving something makes you wish desperately that you could stay and then there are times when the leaving reminds you a hundred times over why exactly you had to leave in the first place

each time is true but the truths are not the same

time is but the stream i go afishing in i drink at it but while i drink i see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is its thin current slides away but eternity remains

the clock on the morning lenape building

must clocks be circles

time is not a circle

suppose the mother of all minutes started

right here on the sidewalk

in front of the morning lenape building and the parade

of minutes that followedeach of them say one inch long

headed out that way down bridge street

where would now be this minute

out past the moon

the nearest star

who came up with minutes anyway

who needs them

they shorten fun and measure misery

get rid of them i say

down with minutes

and while youre at ittake hours

with you too dont get me started

on them

clocksthats the problem

every clock is a nest of minutes and hours

clocks strap us into their shape

instead of heading for the nearest star all we do

clocks lock us into minutes make ferris wheel

riders of us all lug us round and round

from number to number

dice the time of our lives into tiny bits

until the bits are all we know

and the only question we care to ask is

what time is it

as if minutes could tell

as if arnold could look up at this clock on

the lenape building and read

as if charlies time is not forever stuck

as if a swarm of stinging minutes waits for betty lou

to step outside

as if love does not tell all the time the huffelmeyers

need to know

just cause theres snow on the roof doesnt mean theres not a fire inside

i dont need time i need a deadline

because time is a drop in the ocean and you cannot measure off one drop against another to see which one is bigger which one is smaller

time has no meaning in itself unless we choose to give it significance

i hate time it never does what you want it to

for every book you buy you should buy the time to read it

time was a funny and fickle thing sometimes there was never enough of it and other times it stretched out endlessly

i am what time circumstance history have made of me certainly but i am also much more than that so are we all

times change as do our wills what we are  is ever changing all the world is made of change and forever attaining new qualities

if we take the time to unravel the surreptitious fragments from the past that are veiled in the muddle and jumble of our memory we may single out the essentials for the present that might be best shots for the future never looking back again

time is the longest distance between two places

the real dawah to islam is the character of a muslim

is time the wheel that turns or the track it leaves behind

the advantage of living is not measured by length but by use some men have lived long and lived little attend to it while you are in it it lies in your will not in the number of years for you to have lived enough

youthfulness is about how you live not when you were born

time felt slower when we do nothing but wait

i have never killed anybody it is true but it is because i lacked the courage or the time not because i lacked the desire

your past is a skeleton walking one step behind you and your future is a a skeleton walking one step in front of you maybe you dont wear a watch but your skeletons do and they always know what time it is

i lied and said i was busy

i was busy

but not in a way most people understand

i was busy taking deeper breaths

i was busy silencing irrational thoughts

i was busy calming a racing heart

i was busy telling myself i am okay

sometimes this is my busy

and i will not apologize for it

time really is one big continuous cloth no we habitually cut out pieces of time to fit us so we tend to fool ourselves into thinking that time is our size but it really goes on and on

universitys like this little world a bubble of time separate from everything before and everything after

but why do only unimportant things asked milo who suddenly remembered how much time he spent each day doing them

love is a vessel that contains both security and adventure and commitment offers one of the great luxuries of life time marriage is not the end of romance it is the beginning

satire is tragedy plus time you give it enough time the public the reviewers will allow you to satirize it which is rather ridiculous when you think about it

time was like that though  racing forward when she wanted it to slow down then crawling to a stop when she could least bear it

a life is not a waste of time

she should have been thrilled but instead she felt tired like all those things belonged to someone else

for while directly we say that it the length of human life is ages long we are reminded that it is briefer than the fall of a rose leaf to the ground

as time goes by as time goes by the whipcrack of the years the precipice of illusions the ravine that swallows up all human endeavour except the struggle to survive

since time is the one immaterial object which we cannot influence—neither speed up nor slow down add to nor diminish—it is an imponderably valuable gift

…everyone needs a somewhere a place he can go there comes a time you see inevitably there comes a time you have to have a somewhere you can go

time keeps on slippin slippin slippin into the future

i am a stride at a time a very short space of time through very short time of space

in a certain sense the past is far more real or at any rate more stable more resilient than the present the present slips and vanishes like sand between the fingers acquiring material weight only in its recollection

love is not love

which alters when alteration finds

or bends with the remover to remove

oh no it is an everfixèd mark

that looks on tempests and is never shaken

then all collapsed and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago

seize the time live now make now always the most precious time now will never come again

the sun burnt every day it burnt time

in this moment there is plenty of time in this moment you are precisely as you should be in this moment there is infinite possibility

how quick and rushing life can sometimes seem when at the same time its so slow and sweet and everlasting

if i could i would stop the passage of time but hour follows on hour minute on minute each second robbing me of a morsel of myself for the nothing of tomorrow i shall never experience this moment again

no need to feel guilty if you cant be a good man all the time

but anytime your heart is feeling so eager to do even a small good deed

then it might be a good chance for you…

to be a better man

when time is reduced to linear progress it is emptied of presence

justice is the only worship

love is the only priest

ignorance is the only slavery

happiness is the only good

the time to be happy is now

the place to be happy is here

the way to be happy is to make others so

wisdom is the science of happiness

nobody works better under pressure they just work faster

how much more of the mosque of prayer and fasting

better go drunk and begging round the taverns

khayyam drink wine for soon this clay of yours

will make a cup bowl one day a jar

when once you hear the roses are in bloom

then is the time my love to pour the wine

houris and palaces and heaven and hell

these are but fairytales forget them all

the important thing is that man is lost in time in the moment that immediately precedes him  which only attests by reflection to the fact that he is lost in the moment that follows

its not that we have little time but more that we waste a good deal of it

her hands crept around his neck tangling in his hair to keep him closer even though she knew that beautiful boys with expiration dates couldnt be held only borrowed for a time

i care not that this moment’s lot was thin and sparsely dealt all pleasures sweet can be forgot the instant they are felt

im not ashamed of heroic ambitions if man and woman can only dance upon this earth for a few countable turns of the sun let each of us be an artemis odysseus or zeus aphrodite to the extent of the will of each one

… query how contrive not to waste ones time

answer by being fully aware of it all the while

money is not the only commodity that is fun to give we can give time we can give our expertise we can give our love or simply give a smile what does that cost the point is none of us can ever run out of something worthwhile to give

it is too late

the old man shook his head it is never too late or too soon it is when it is supposed to be

he smiled there is a plan dor

what happened in their first five minutes

time plays tricks between here and home said mogget sepulchrally frightening the life out of the telephone operator

but for some of us theres only today and the truth is you never really know

because neither she nor port had ever lived a life of any kind of regularity they had both made the fatal error of coming hazily to regard time as nonexistent one year was like another year eventually everything would happen

for disappearing acts its hard to beat what happens to the eight hours supposedly left after eight of sleep and eight of work

adventure works in any strand—it calls to those who care more for living than for their lives

you could lose the ones you loved in the blink of an eye—and he was willing to bet when it happened you weren’t thinking about all the reasons that could have kept you apart you thought of all the reasons that kept you together

and no doubt how you wished you’d had more time even if you’d had centuries…

no one got forever and it was a fucking crime to waste what you were given

i sound contemptuous but i am not i am interestedintrigued evenby the way time erases real lives leaving only vague imprints blood and spirit fade away so that only names and dates remain

understanding is not absolutely final

whats now right could be wrong later

dont live the same year  times and call it a life

for this too i learned that a storytellers tale may end but history goes on always these events so distant in legend play a part in shaping the very events we witness about us each and every day

it seemed my whole

life was composed of these disjointed

public place and then another as if i were

waiting for trains that never came and like

one of those ghosts who are said to linger

passersby for the timetable of the midnight

express that derailed twenty years before i

wandered from light to light until that

dreaded hour when all the doors closed and

stepping from the world of warmth and

people and conversation overheard i felt

the old familiar cold twist through my bones

again and then it was all forgotten the

warmth the lights i had never been warm

in my life ever

time talks behind our back to our face its friendly and logical never hesitating to give more of itself but when were not looking it steals our lives and says bad things about us to the parts of us its stolen

the most precious thing i have to give is my time

travellers understand instinctively and by experience that travel and adventure change and elongate time even while navigating the deadlines of airline and train departures

waste your money and youre only out of money but waste your time and youve lost a part of your life

who do you spend time with criticizers or encouragers surround yourself with those who believe in you your life is too important for anything less

you can’t live your life thinking death is going to come all the time you have to live life and if it comes then we can only hope we were able to do all the things we wanted he has to want to do something everyone does

art is long and time is fleeting

there’s been time this whole time you can’t kill time with your heart everything takes time

the time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic the passions that we feel expand it those that we inspire contract it and habit fills up what remains

time did not compose her

one of the great disadvantages of hurry is that it takes such a long time

but thoughts the slave of life and life time’s fool

and time that takes survey of all the world

must have a stop

it is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used

describing in  the value to astronomers of the handcranked calculating machine he had invented in

they say that time assuages—

time never did assuage

an actual suffering strengthens

as sinews do with age

time is a test of trouble

but not a remedy

if such it prove it prove too

there was no malady

person a understand person b because the time is right for that to happen not because person b wants to be understood by person a

when you start something make sure that youre willing to take the time to finish it right because honey the work you put into it will be more than worth it in the end the best things always are

the summer stretched out the daylight as if on a rack each moment was drawn out until its anatomy collapsed time broke down the day progressed in an endless sequence of dead moments

when you kill time remember that it has no resurrection

there is only one of you in all time this expression is unique and if you block it it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost

ive changed my ways a little i cannot now

run with you in the evenings along the shore

except in a kind of dream and you if you dream a moment

you see me there

socks are only physically small by stitch count they are immense

theres time for laughing and theres time for crying—

—a time for growing and a time for dying

a night for silence and a day for singing

but more than allas all your more than eyes

tell methere is a time for timelessness

wonder is the heaviest element on the periodic table even a tiny fleck of it stops time

to his coy mistress

had we but world enough and time

this coyness lady were no crime

we would sit down and think which way

to walk and pass our long love’s day

thou by the indian ganges’ side

shouldst rubies find i by the tide

of humber would complain i would

love you ten years before the flood

and you should if you please refuse

till the conversion of the jews

my vegetable love should grow

vaster than empires and more slow

an hundred years should go to praise

thine eyes and on thy forehead gaze

two hundred to adore each breast

but thirty thousand to the rest

an age at least to every part

and the last age should show your heart

for lady you deserve this state

nor would i love at lower rate

but at my back i always hear

time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near

and yonder all before us lie

thy beauty shall no more be found

nor in thy marble vault shall sound

my echoing song then worms shall try

that longpreserved virginity

and your quaint honour turn to dust

and into ashes all my lust

the grave’s a fine and private place

but none i think do there embrace

now therefore while the youthful hue

and while thy willing soul transpires

at every pore with instant fires

now let us sport us while we may

and now like amorous birds of prey

rather at once our time devour

than languish in his slowchapped power

let us roll all our strength and all

our sweetness up into one ball

and tear our pleasures with rough strife

thorough the iron gates of life

thus though we cannot make our sun

stand still yet we will make him run

im open to everything when you start to criticize the times you live in your time is over

everything you need is already within you the beauty of life is that your destiny lies always in your hands the time has come for you to step up and be great

time there is much time left and lots of life seasons there is much to see to do and to be

the youthful body untouched decays the fastest for no living hands record its splendor and here youth and time are wasted

begin doing what you want to do now we are not living in eternity we have only this moment sparkling like a star in our hand  and melting like a snowflake let us use it before it is too late

losing someone you really love dont never get easier you just go a few hours longer without breaking down thats all thats all  bubba

procrastination is also a subtle act of corruption – it corrupts valuable time

but what minutes count them by sensation and not by calendars and each moment is a day

so of course time is necessary but nevertheless damn painful for it transforms all the pieces of your life  joy and sorrow youth and age love and hate terror and bliss  from fire into smoke rising up the air and dissipating on a breeze

but some relationships arent meant to last

they are worthy only till the time the two persons involved have time for each other

they do not know eternity they live for the present the now and when distance plays it part or life turns out to be busy they fall apart

and may be thats why theyre never termed love they simply remain what they were  mere relationships

fear of death is form of stasis horrors the dead weight of time

what are you that makes me feel thus who are you for whom time has no meaning

but that’s the trouble with moments—they end narrator

when the rare chance comes seize it

to do the rare deed

this world is out of date

we have trained them to think of the future as a promised land which favored heroes attainnot as something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour whatever he does whoever he is

also though not overelderly he was not overyoung

and when your sorrow is comforted time soothes all sorrows you will be content that you have known me

if you dont write when you dont have time for it you wont write when you do have time for it

today is an ephemeral ghost

a strange amazing day that comes only once every four years for the rest of the time it does not exist

in mundane terms it marks a leap in time when the calendar is adjusted to make up for extra seconds accumulated over the preceding three years due to the rotation of the earth a day of temporal tune up

but this day holds another secret—it contains one of those truly rare moments of delightful transience and light uncertainty that only exist on the razor edge of things along a buzzing plane of quantum probability

will you or wont you should you or shouldnt you

use this day to do something daring extraordinary and unlike yourself take a chance and shape a different pattern in your personal cloud of probability

any moment called now is always full of possibles

what is this life if full of care

we have no time to stand and stare

the lives of all people flow through time and regardless of how brutal one moment may be how filled with grief or pain or fear time flows through all lives equally

foolishness sleeps soundly while knowledge turns with each thinking hour longing for the dawn of answers

there will be time there will be time

to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet

there will be time to murder and create

and time for all the works and days of hands

that lift and drop a question on your plate

time for you and time for me

and time yet for a hundred indecisions

and for a hundred visions and revisions

before the taking of a toast and tea

six am xander cried i know thats a number on my clock but ive never actually been awake to personally witness it

time i would have gone somewhere to buy time

like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore

so do our minutes hasten to their end

each changing place with that which goes before

in sequent toil all forwards do contend

everyone just wasting time because they have so much of it to waste minutes slipping by on whos with who and did you hear

its funny i dont feel any older than i did when i was twenty but i know i am because recently some twentyyearold called me sir sometimes the only way you know you are getting older is by the way others treat you

waiting simply one person doing nothing over time while another approached

when days seem like years and years feel like days

i had drunk much wine and afterward coffee and strega and i explained winefully how we did not do the things we wanted to do we never did such things

we’re gonna make up for that we’re gonna live a long time together

she had the bizarre feeling of time bending all around her as though she was from the past reading about the future or from the future reading about the past

we are preoccupied with time if we could learn to love space as deeply as we are now obsessed with time we might discover a new meaning in the phrase to live like men

glance into the world just as though time were gone and everything crooked will become straight to you

the first step towards mastering time is always to make time meaningless

time ms mchenry townsend said it can be a cruel cruel thing

time works so hard for us if only we can let it

love is spelt time

truth is the daughter of time and i feel no shame in being her midwife

the concept of time as it’s commonly understood by normal

people with normal jobs and normal goddamn lives doesn’t

exist on the road the nights spread out like the dark

godforsaken highways that distinguish them and the days run

together like thanksgiving dinner smothered in gravy you

never really know where you are or what time it is and the outside

world starts to fade away

it’s cool

we both wondered whether these contradictions that one cant avoid if one begins to think of time and space may not really be proofs that the whole of life is a dream and the moon and stars bits of nightmare

you can’t buy time nick ever it’s the only thing in life you can’t get most of and it’s the one thing that will mercilessly tear you up when it’s gone it takes no pity on no soul and no heart

there is only now and look how rich we are in it

but words are things and a small drop of ink

that which makes thousands perhaps millions think

’t is strange the shortest letter which man uses

of ages to what straits old time reduces

frail man when paper — even a rag like this

survives himself his tomb and all that’s his

each moment spent on this bright blue planet is precious so use it carefully

occasionally we all do wrong things from right motives only time can prove us right or wrong the past is the past nothing can change it now and who is to say that it was all wrong anyway

the moment seemed endless but it was probably only half that

were both thieves harvey swick i take time you take lives but in the end were the same both thieves of always

i cant talk you in terms of time your time and my time are different

now i wonder if it means that the future is a place or like a place that i could go to that is go to in some way other

than just getting older

is it later yet

time heals even the deepest wounds

time turns our lies into truths

given that life is so short do i really want to spend oneninetieth of my remaining days on earth reading edward gibbon

time doesnt heal all wounds only distance can lessen the sting of them

cant bring back time like holding water in your hand

anyone who believes that a second is faster than a decade did not live life

seems like those faded years of childhood that flew

away in some dilemma

always in some confusion

the purpose of this life

seems like an illusion

there is so little time we need to make every moment count

most of us take for granted that time flies meaning that it passes too quickly but in the mindful state time doesnt really pass at all there is only a single instant of time that keeps renewing itself over and over with infinite variety

day is just a collection of hours

as a breath on glass

as witchfires that burn

the gods and monsters pass

are dust and return

the face of the skies

the only difference between a young person at the height of their exuberance and a very old person who is frail and physically wasted is time

it has been a week since ami died and this morning i woke suddenly hours before dawn indeed the same hour as when my mother died it was not a dream that woke me but a thought and with that thought i could swear i heard amis voice

that is what happened with ami and me this miracle of chance

one who gossips usually carries boredom in one hand and bitterness in the other

i congratulate myself on not having arrived into the world until the present time this age suits my taste

we have to forego some good things in order to choose others that are better or best because they develop faith in the lord jesus christ and strengthen our families

they say time will make all this go away but its time thats taken my tomorrow and turned them into yesterday

let your heart shine even more than your face the beautiful contents of your heart can never be forgotten but your face will be a history

time doesnt stop or give warning it simply ticks along marking time ignoring humanity

is déjà vu actually the specter of false timelines that never happened but did casting their shadows upon reality

a relationship that is truly genuine does not keep changing its colors real gold never rusts if a relationship is really solid and golden it will be unbreakable not even time can destroy its shine

understand one thing – the time is the only actual currency you have even though it might be daunting for some people it’s the ultimate truth

time is merely a feature of our memories and expectations

in this world one of the biggest illusions that we live in is that we have unlimited time with that mindset we are uncontrolled to waste it as much as we can

have you heard the story of the man who wasted his life taking drugs and playing sudoku and when he realized that he could do something meaningful he worked hard and even got his time back

there isn’t one because you can’t get your time back

maybe you will be able to rebuild everything you have lost but time my friend is always ticking and remember no matter what you do you will never be able to win it back again

the time you profligate in procrastinating is the actual wealth you are wasting

procrasdemon has the power to actually make you waste your entire life doing purposeless things and the worst part is that you wont even be aware of this

i look out into the water and up deep into the stars i beg the sparkling lanterns of light to cure me of myself — my past and the kaleidoscope of mistakes failures and wrong turns that have stacked unbearable regret upon my shoulders

the most inefficient and selfharming thing a person can do is go out looking for love let it find you when the time is right and youre out doing what you love to do only then will you find it in its truest form

the days werent long enough for the reading she wanted to do

does our purpose on earth directly link to the people whom we end up meeting are our relationships and experiences actually the required dots that connect and then lead us to our ultimate destinies

time obliterates the fictions of opinion and confirms the decisions of nature

i got tired of feeling like dracula i wanted to see some daylight and not just at six o’clock in the morning

every flower blooms at a different pace

maybe the more emotions a person experiences in their daily lives the longer time seems to feel to them as you get older you experience fewer new things and so time seems to go by faster

these wrinkles are nothing

these gray hairs are nothing

this stomach which sags

with old food these bruised

and swollen ankles

my darkening brain

they are nothing

i am the same boy

my mother used to kiss

our nemesis is time against which we have a single ally memory and even it betrays us

if the whole world i once could see

on free soil stand with the people free

then to the moment might i say

linger awhile  so fair thou art

she needed andrew simpson smith it was that simple and he had spent his life training to help people like her gods

okay andrew but lets leave today im in a hurry

of course today he stroked the place where his slight beard was beginning to grow these ruins where your friends are waiting where are they

tally glances up at the sun still low enough to indicate the eastern horizon after a moments calculation she pointed off to the northwest back toward the city and beyond that the rusty ruins about a weeks walk that way

that means seven days

yes i know the gods calendar he said huffily but a whole week

yeah thats not so far is it the hunters had been tireless on their march the night before

he shook his head an awed expression on his face but that is beyond the edge of the world

when a country is defeated there remain only mountains and rivers and on a ruined castle in spring only grasses thrive i sat down on my hat and wept bitterly till i almost forgot time

is all that remains

of the dreams and ambitions

this was long before the term singleparent family came into use back then it was a broken home

what we call time isnt chronological but spatial what we call death is merely a transition between different kinds of matter

the future is a split second away

procrasdemon will steal the most valuable asset you have  time

punctuality is the thief of time

if you work without being distracted you can do so much in one hour something that is not even achievable in a month especially if you are not living with a procrasdemon – a blood curdling timewasting machine

time is like the mississippi river it only flows in one direction you can never go back

there are little pockets of old time in london where things and places stay the same like bubbles in amber she explained there’s a lot of time in london and it has to go somewhere—it doesn’t all get used up at once

i may still be hung over sighed richard that almost made sense

things take the time they take

dont worry

how many roads did st augustine follow before he became st augustine

did i live the spring i’d sought

it’s true in joy i walked along

and sang the song

and never tried to bind an hour

to my borrowed garden bower

nor did i once entreat

a day to slumber at my feet

yet days aren’t lulled by lyric song

like morning birds they pass along

o’er crests of trees to none belong

their larking flight my hands eschew

thus i’ll say it once and true…

from all that i saw

and everywhere i wandered

i learned that time cannot be spent

it only can be squandered

after long enough everyone in the world will be you enemy

the time would not pass somebody was playing with the clocks and not only the electronic clocks but the windup kind too the second hand on my watch would twitch once and a year would pass and then it would twitch again

there was nothing i could do about it as an earthling i had to believe whatever clocks said and calendars

from the time were born until we die were kept busy with artificial stuff that isnt important

a man that is young in years may be old in hours if he have lost no time

would we trade all those pages for a single hour or all of our books for one real minute

if you dont make the time to work on creating the life you want youre eventually going to be forced to spend a lot of time dealing with a life you dont want

god schedules a birthday not man

time has always been the greatest ally to truth because time eventually relieves and reveals all

… for overstrong was the command to hold fast to each smallest particle of time to the smallest particle of every circumstance and to embody all of them in memory as if they could be preserved in memory through all deaths for all times

sometimes exhaustion is not a result of too much time spent on something but of knowing that in its place no time is spent on something else

time is a great teacher but unfortunately it kills all its pupils

had we but world enough and time

i guarantee you that after you die you will not say i spent too much time praying i wish i had watched more tv instead

perhaps life is like an hour glass with dear ones the sand that slips from the upper glassthe earthinto the secondeternity

time which grays hair and wrinkles faces also withers violent affections and much more quickly

but time has a way of stealthily deciding a person’s mind without her conscious knowledge and as she studied and procrastinated poison found one day that she had come to know her choice

smartass disciple which one was first created time or things

master of stupidity no things no changes no changes no time

the snow filled the air with a soft greyblue mist softening the wind and gunfire bringing the earth and sky together into one swaying blur

this soft white snow settling over the carnage of the city was time itself the present was turning into the past and there was no future

you cant make footprints in the sand of time if youre sitting on your butt and who wants to make buttprints in the sand of time

if you have sixty seconds worth of distancerun

the four heavenly fountains

laugh i tell you

and you will turn back

the hands of time

smile i tell you

and you will reflect

the face of the divine

sing i tell you

and all the angels will sing with you

cry i tell you

and the reflections found in your pool of tears

will remind you of the lessons of today and yesterday

to guide you through the fears of tomorrow

in the end the wind takes everything doesnt it and why not why other if the sweetness of our lives did not depart there would be no sweetness at all

i fantasize the night sky to be like a cosmic blue print of my life as i close my eyes and unbutton my heart… just in case anyone up there is listening

something somewhere knows what’s best for me and promises to keep sending me people and experiences to light my way as long as i live in gratitude and keep paying attention to the signs

i’ve grown up defined by this desperate undeniable ‘can’t breathe’ kind of space inside of myself and i’m afraid that the diagnosis is fatal

sadness experienced when one realized that unlike ones dog one cannot live only in the present tense as kierkegaard said life must be lived forward

it makes me wonder do we spend most of our days trying to remember or forget things do we spend most of our time running towards or away from our lives i dont know

everything started as nothing

there is nowhere morning does not go

a true friend is one you can go extended periods without seeing or talking to yet the moment that you are back in touch its like no time has passed at all

in the darkness of night

in the light of day

in the time in between

we live our lives alone and searching

and sometimes softly

you understand damnation

all is forgotten all is lost

all but forgiveness

and the memory of her kiss

if you set out to be liked you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time and you would achieve nothing

what is this life if full of care

we have no time to stand and stare

no time to stand beneath the boughs

and stare as long as sheep or cows

no life goes past so swiftly as an eventless one no clock spins like a clock whose days are all alike

time is the wisest of all things that are for it brings everything to light

a life can change in a tenth of

or sometimes it can take

i spit into the face of time

that has transfigured me

its so egotistical to believe that we know more about someone elses reality than they do and such a waste of time

if today you dont have time for those who gave all their time for you yesterday then tomorrow they will not have time to give to you who has no time today

time is a structured perception towards observable changes

i was transformed the day

my ego shattered

and all the superficial material

things that mattered

to me before

to matter

time cures you first and then it kills you

then deborah stood at the wicket gate the boundary and there was a woman with outstretched hand demanding tickets

pass through she said when deborah reached her we saw you coming the wicket gate became a turnstile deborah pushed against it and there was no resistance she was through

what is it she asked am i really here at last is this the bottom of the pool

it could be smiled the woman there are so many ways you just happened to choose this one

other people were pressing to come through they had no faces they were only shadows deborah stood aside to let them by and in a moment they had gone all phantoms

why only now tonight asked deborah why not in the afternoon when i came to the pool

its a trick said the woman you seize on the moment in time we were here this afternoon were always here our life goes on around you but nobody knows it the tricks easier by night thats all

am i dreaming then asked deborah

no said the woman this isnt a dream and it isnt death either its the secret world

the secret world it was something deborah had always known and now the pattern was complete the memory of it and the relief were so tremendous that something seemed to burst inside her heart

why you why us for that matter why anything because the moment simply is

the work of memory collapses time

it wasnt that time stopped in the library it was as if it were captured collected here and in all libraries  and not only my time my life but all human time as well in the library time is dammed upnot just stopped but saved

time is for dragonflies and angels the former live too little and the latter live too long

art is the whisper of history heard above the noise of time

deeds need time even after they are done in order to be seen or heard

any time gone by was better

real relationships are the product of time spent which is why so many of us have so few of them

but at my back i always hear

time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near

and yonder all before us lie

thy beauty shall no more be found

nor in thy marble vault shall sound

my echoing song then worms shall try

that longpreserved virginity

and your quaint honour turn to dust

and into ashes all my lust

the grave’s a fine and private place

but none i think do there embrace

i love the sight of his naked body

time tying its shoes

the clock strikes off the hollow halfhours of all the life that is left to you one by one

some people say they have  years experience when in reality they have  years experience repeated  times stephen m r covey to richie norton when norton asked if he was too young to train older executives for covey

it will happen but it will take time

through memory we travel against time through forgetfulness we follow its course

work as if every time you started with and every time you finish

parsifal is on his way to the temple of the grail knights and says i hardly move yet far i seem to have come and the allknowing gurnemanz replies you see my son time turns here into space

it’s quite simple death isn’t what we think it is it isn’t life which ends but time which stops

sometime life is full of joyand sometime life is full of pain and tears

but we have to defeat it

creativity is the residue of time wasted

the past he thought is linked with the present by an unbroken chain of events flowing one out of another and it seemed to him that he had just seen both ends of that chain that when he touched one end the other quivered

time goes on crutches till love have all his rites

but life is just a party and parties werent meant to last

clocks and calendars do not exist to remind us of the time weve forgotten but to regulate our relations with others and indeed all of society and this is how we use them

so a woman whose daily life is overwhelming her learns to step back is this a cure for her endless problems of course not simple is not simplistic

you dont have time len that is the most bitter and the most beautiful piece of advice i can offer if you dont have what you want now you dont have what you want

most of the time   percent of the time  you just dont know how and why the threads are looped together and thats okay do a good thing and something bad happens do a bad thing and something good happens do nothing and everything explodes

and very very rarely  by some miracle of chance and coincidence butterflies beating their wings just so and all the threads hanging together for a minute  you get the chance to do the right thing

perhaps time’s definition of coal is the diamond

while people brood time skips ahead without looking back

it doesnt really matter if you are left behind the back but what matters is your capacity to pull and push everyone by your way to get to the front

people like to warn you that by the time you reach the middle of your life passion will begin to feel like a meal eaten long ago which you remember with great tenderness

time wounds all heals

every moment is a crossroad in time consider that as above so below and as inside so outside and live accordingly

the telephone

when i was just as far as i could walk

from here today

there was an hour

all still

when leaning with my head against a flower

i heard you talk

dont say i didnt for i heard you say

you spoke from that flower on the window sill

do you remember what it was you said

first tell me what it was you thought you heard

having found the flower and driven a bee away

i leaned my head

and holding by the stalk

i listened and i thought i caught the word

what was it

did you call me by my name

or did you say

i heard it as i bowed

i may have thought as much but not aloud

well so i came

for he lives twice who can at once employ

the present well and e’en the past enjoy

the special virtue of freedom is not that it makes you richer and more powerful but that it gives you more time to understand what it means to be alive

god really performs the miracle of multiplying our time but only if we give it to him first

look back on time with kindly eyes

he doubtless did his best

how softly sinks that trembling sun

in human natures west

i get up at seven yeah and i go to work at nine i got no time for livin yes im workin all the time it seems to me i could live my life a lot better than i think i am i guess thats why they call me they call me the workin man

how can you say i love you forever  whereas bit of time can change everything

as cruel as life might be at times if you throw in the towel which is what everyone will expect then nothing good will happen and your life will fall apart be better than that

o words are poor receipts for what time hath stole away

again time elapsed

i just wish moments weren’t so fleeting isaac called to the man on the roof they pass so quickly

stupid fool isaac muttered quietly to himself as soon as he was far enough away not to be heard

i am old enough to know that time passing is just a trick a convenience everything is always there still unfolding still happening the past the present and the future in the noggin eternally like brushes combs and ribbons in a handbag

the calendar of the theocracy of muntab counts down not up noone knows why but it might not be a good idea to hang around and find out

the only problem is time

time itself is created through deeds of true kindness

all im saying is love changes over time no person is ever perfect for another person

all objects exist in a moment of time

depression as far as im concerned is just a waste of time

o the joy of my spiritit is uncagedit darts like lightning

it is not enough to have this globe or a certain time

i will have thousands of globes and all time

you attract poverty when you lack value for time

much may be done in those little shreds and patches of time which every day produces and which most men throw away

the candle glimmers but an hour the night

looms in its ancient hunger would you know

the tragedy of human love and need

gaze on the stars then on a brothers face

some days some times are remembered by me in life’s all moments they are cherished by me

time is a player time is part of today not simply a measure of its passing

people who understands how to convert their time into useful products do not complain of boredom

the day is refracted and the next and the one after that all of them broken up into a hundred juggled segments each brilliant and selfcontained so that the hours are no longer linear but assorted like bright sweets in a jar

time like an everrolling stream

bears all its sons away

they fly forgotten as a dream

dies at the opening day

you can be your own boss

life becomes a dilemma when you are living a purposeless and goalless life

time present and time past

are both perhaps present in time future

and time future contained in time past

if all time is eternally present

all time is unredeemable

what might have been is an abstraction

only in a world of speculation

what might have been and what has been

point to one end which is always present

were thinking does life owe us anything did we get it wrong and time is an animal man the years time is killing us it has us in its teeth

time stops for no one no matter how unsure we are of the future

i’ve always seen this in you ever since you were a little girl — this hunger to love other people into their highest selves and it’s what has made me irreversibly and just so forever in love with you

times never up she whispered not looking at me but at my canvas just like theres always time for pain theres always time for healing of course there is

the hopi an indian tribe have a language as sophisticated as ours but no tenses for past present and future the division does not exist what does this say about time

matter that thing the most solid and the wellknown which you are holding in your hands and which makes up your body is now known to be mostly empty space empty space and points of light what does this say about the reality of the world

art enables us to find ourselves and loose ourselves at the same time

but time passes fear becomes a memory terror becomes routine it loses its grip

it takes a long time to learn how to do something simple

death is a part of life they are dancing together the dance of infinity in front of the gates of time we can live our dreams as we are dreaming our future time is the endless consciousness

what use was time to those whod soon achieve digital immortality

as a writer of philosophy its good to ask oneself will i still believe this a week from now or months or even years

time stretches and calms but still we reach for we belonged then we want to know sometimes that knowledge is painful or inconvenient or even damning but it is essential it exposes us for what we have been and can be

and never never dear madam put wednesday simply as the date that way madness lies

time has transfigured them into

untruth the stone fidelity

they hardly meant has come to be

their final blazon and to prove

our almostinstinct almost true

what will survive of us is love

we are no longer in the dispensation of age and experience we are in the era of knowledge and information information leads a true leader and a true leader leads others

a journey is time suspended

do you know where your breakthrough begins your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends

time remorselessly rambles down the corridors and streets of our lives but it is not until autumn that most of us become aware that our tickets are stamped with a terminal destination

dont be in a hurry everything arise in the due time

money and beauty are defenses against the sorrows of this world but neither can undo the past only time will conquer time the way forward is the only way back to innocence and to peace

if i must go

if i must go to heavens end

climbing the ages like a stair

be near me and forever bend

with the same eyes above me there

time will fly past us like leaves flying

we shall not heed for we shall be

knowing and known unchangeably

they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder i think the same could be said for time

shadows fell on them like predators as the light went out

time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle

fear of sundays not in a religious sense but rather a condition that reflects fear of unstructured time also known as acalendrical anxiety not to be confused with didominicaphobia or kyriakephobia fear of the lords day

i remember when all this will be again

we can no longer create the feeling of an eraof time being particular to one spot in time

there was a sudden stillness like the gap between ticks on a clock but the next tick never coming

but at my back i always hear

time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near

one way poetry connects is across time    some echo of a writers physical experience comes into us when we read her poem

knowing you are alive is watching on every side your generations short time falling away as fast as rivers drop through air and feeling it hit

time erodes us all

time was a wave almost cruel in its relentlessness as it whisked her life downstream a life she had to constantly strain to keep from breaking apart

theres no backward and no forward no day other than this you fill your cart as you go and thats that

listen to the time as it can heal everything

and how it slips through my fingers

without putting its ring on them

and i remain simply its lover

the last thing the hockey ball symbolized was time itself the unstoppability of it the way were chained to our bodies which are chained to time

asa had a sharp understanding of the futurethat is a time when this would be past time was rushing through and around him he almost heard it whistling and this awareness rounded the world somehow and made it sweet

and at the end of the night they realized how important those little stars were which they ignored while adoring the beauty of the moon whole night

for love was a kind of folly a losing game the greatest of all wastes of time but then that depended on what you thought time was for

loneliness always eats up time fills on depression where hands move slow to reach out for a moment of care

every day has a past every day has a tomorrow

i feel a resurgence of my yearold self… that little warrior goddess of a girl reminding me of who i was when i was little before the world got its hands on me

i know that this process of ‘me changing my life’ doesn’t just end once i set fire to this list of things i hate about myself tonight isn’t as much of a new beginning as it is a violent end and i know the real work hasn’t even started yet

i’m going to follow this invisible red thread until i find myself again… until i finally figure out… who i’m meant to be

how quickly people changed with their interests their feelings wellmade phrases replaced by wellmade phrases time is a flow of words coherent only in appearance the one who piles up the most is the one who wins

i wanted to figure out why i was so busy but i couldnt find the time to do it

time is not a line but a dimension like the dimensions of space if you can bend space you can bend time also and if you knew enough and could move faster than light you could travel backward in time and exist in two places at once

gather ye rosebuds while ye may

old time is still aflying

and this same flower that smiles today

tomorrow will be dying

live you say in the present

live only in the present

but i don’t want the present i want reality

i want things that exist not time that measures them

what is the present

it’s something relative to the past and the future

it’s a thing that exists in virtue of other things existing

i only want reality things without the present

i don’t want to include time in my scheme

i don’t want to think about things as present i want to think of them as things

i don’t want to separate them from themselves treating them as present

i shouldn’t even treat them as real

i should treat them as nothing

i should see them only see them

see them till i can’t think about them

see them without time without space

to see dispensing with everything but what you see

and this is the science of seeing which isn’t a science

what a slut time is she screws with everybody

i imagined i was god for a millisecond

and became speechless for a long time

there is something magical about the world at night sitting at the dining room table sipping a glass of iced tea i can totally understand why dad gets up so early minutes seem to last longer when the rest of the world is asleep

we tend to forget that life can only be defined in the present tense

the feeling one has no time to get anything done provides the pressure that guarantees one does get some things done

thus though we cannot make our sun

stand still yet we will make him run

time goes by time comes along

all is old and all is new

what is right and what is wrong

you must think and ask of you

have no hope and have no fear

waves that rise can never hold

if they urge or if they cheer

you remain aloof and cold

to our sight a lot will glisten

many sounds will reach our ear

who could take the time to listen

and remember all we hear

keep aside from all that patter

seek yourself far from the throng

when with loud and idle clatter

time goes by time comes along

nor forget the tongue of reason

or its even scales depress

when the moment changing season

wears the mask of happiness

it is born of reasons slumber

and may last a wink as true

for the one who knows its number

all is old and all is new

be as to a play spectator

as the world unfolds before

you will know the heart of matter

should they act two parts or four

when they cry or tear asunder

from your seat enjoy along

and youll learn from art to wonder

what is right and what is wrong

past and future ever blending

are the twin sides of same page

new start will begin with ending

when you know to learn from age

all that was or be tomorrow

we have in the present too

but whats vain and futile sorrow

you must think and ask of you

for the living cannot sever

from the means weve always had

now as years ago and ever

men are happy or are sad

other masks same play repeated

diffrent tongues same words to hear

of your dreams so often cheated

have no hope and have no fear

hope not when the villains cluster

by success and glory drawn

fools with perfect lack of luster

will outshine hyperion

fear it not theyll push each other

to reach higher in the fold

do not side with them as brother

waves that rise can never hold

life attracts you into eddies

to change actors in the play

steal aside from crowd and bustle

do not look seem not to hear

from your path away from hustle

if they urge or if they cheer

if they reach for you go faster

hold your tongue when slanders yell

your advice they cannot master

dont you know their measure well

let them talk and let them chatter

let all go past young and old

unattached to man or matter

you remain aloof and cold

you remain aloof and cold

if they urge or if they cheer

waves that rise can never hold

have no hope and have no fear

you must think and ask of you

what is right and what is wrong

all is old and all is new

time goes by time comes along

we often hear about stepping outside ourselves but rarely about stepping outside our generation

since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea

but sad mortality o’ersways their power

how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea

whose action is no stronger than a flower

o how shall summer’s honey breath hold out

against the wrackful siege of battering days

when rocks impregnable are not so stout

nor gates of steel so strong but time decays

o fearful meditation where alack

shall time’s best jewel from time’s chest lie hid

or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back

or who his spoil of beauty can forbid

o none unless this miracle have might

that in black ink my love may still shine bright

how is the duration of a relationship relative to what those involved in it feel

im convinced that not all units of time are equal

she had learned in her life that time lived inside you you are time you breathe time though she hadnt understood why now she held inside her a cacophony of times and lately it drowned out the world

you need to assess yourself on a yearly basis and see how far you have gone and what you still need to work on

i give it grandfathers watch to you not that you may remember time but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it

you must always overcome your comfort zone

rare and precious moments how i long to live with you eternally if only your sweetness never ceased to touch my lips and the flutters you evoke nevermore faded away i dream of your arm extended immeasurably to keep hold of my reaching hand

but father time being a cruel master will not grant such a wish

and so i tuck you away as cherished memories stored in a treasure box buried in my heart and in times of solitude i shall bring you out to view like rainbows

you only have as much time as you think you do start telling yourself you have enough time

we are unable to discount the hypotheses that the world began three years ago

she understands now what she in all her worry had forgotten that even as she hesitates and wavers even as she thinks too much and moves too cautiously she doesnt always have to get it right its okay to look back even as you move forward

only with time do we really learn who the other person is and come to love the person for him or herself and not just for the feelings and experiences they give us

time does not pass it continues

the question what was there before creation is meaningless time is a property of creation therefore before creation there was no before creation

for all the compasses in the world theres only one direction and time is its only measure

not the intense moment

isolated with no before and after

but a lifetime burning in every moment

they keep track of time sometimes things happen and you feel that you need to mark them down

follow your heart ithilnin albirich repeated time is precious dont waste it living someone elses life

four days will quickly steep themselves in nights

four nights will quickly dream away the time

to world enough and time

at that point in the speech the car hit a bump in the road and the watchdog collapsed in a heap on the front seat with his alarm ringing furiously

and sometimes in life i imagine good things do happen most of the time its the opposite obviously but i dont think you should rule out the possibility that just occasionally chance might deal you a good card

the distance of a voice is only a short time away from touch

it has been raining here for ten yearsi keep an accurate record of time and can state this with no fear of contradiction

if i could i would live forever in this moment but no one can live in a moment and time moves on

story is metaphor for life and life is lived in time

i guess time doesnt flow in order does it  a b c d it just sort of goes where it feels like going

we move through time like a man in a rowboat looking back even as we move forward

now to die of grief

would mean im afraid to die

belatedly while latecomers

are unwelcome particularly in the future

time does nothing but hand you down shabbier and older things

sometimes waiting is the hardest thing

the time is now the person is you better your life and become a name to conjure with in this day and age

they wont be a right be a right time thea it doesnt exist just get it over with

the unreality of the past weeks lifted like a fog but its residue remained all of the past is like that but most especially the parts that are out of the ordinary

it would mark the end of a year that he might look back on as hands a pivot between two lines or not maybe enough time would pass that eventually he would look back on his life all of it as a series of events both logical and continuous

who said all times delight

hath she for narrow bed

lifes troubled bubble broken

thats what i said

things can harden meaningfully in the moment of indecision

time again time like the soul wears many faces many bodies and climates and attitudes the past is one face the present a second and the future yet another

o space and time and stars at strife

how dreadful your infinity

shrined by your termless trinity

how strange how terrible is life

the testimony of the suns

how can i stand before you in silent symbols with open palms

one sin seldom mentioned is that of killing time

the sand in the hourglass runs from one compartment to the other marking the passage of moments with something constant and tangible

if you watch the flowing sand you might see time itself riding the granules

contrary to popular opinion time is not an old whitehaired man but a laughing child

and time sings

one of the schools in tlön has reached the point of denying time it reasons that the present is undefined that the future has no other reality than as present hope that the past is no more than present memory

to wit actions like sounds divide the flow of time into beatsthe quality of a mans life depends on the rhyhmic structure he is able to impose upon the input and output of energy

there are many problems which could only

be solved by generations which are still to be

born later its only one way of many how god

gives answers to human problems and prayers

and if you dont find what youre looking for

at roys question addie looked up

then all ive lost is time

and why does he talk so funny doesnt he mean squashed tomatoes

i dont think that they had tomatoes when he comes from said bod and thats just how they talk then

the full moon symbol on my calendar no longer seemed to be a period marking the end of something but just another way of counting time

money and time are the heaviest burdens of life    the unhappiest of all mortals are those who have more of either than they know how to use

time  life therefore waste your time and waste of your life or master your time and master your life

if the moment is everthing then everything is time

the past embraces the future

the future embraces the past

they are both intertwined

linked in all eternity

time and death its the ultimate vision of an artist at the end of everything its just whats there it was not something i planned to do

its the right idea but not the right time

the friend of time doesnt spend all day saying i havent got time he doesnt fight with time he accepts it and cherishes it

when i do count the clock that tells the time

and see the brave day sunk in hideous night

when i behold the violet past prime

and sable curls all silverd oer with white

when lofty trees i see barren of leaves

which erst from heat did canopy the herd

and summers green all girded up in sheaves

borne on the bier with white and bristly beard

then of thy beauty do i question make

that thou among the wastes of time must go

since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake

and die as fast as they see others grow

and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence

save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence

alice sighed wearily i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers

if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldnt talk about wasting it its him

i dont know what you mean said alice

of course you dont the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously i dare say you never even spoke to time

perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music

i suffered most from the feeling that custom was daily petrifying our lives into one fixed shape that our minds were losing their freedom and becoming enslaved to the steady passionless course of time

because we believe that one moment is more or less like the next we lose touch with the essential urgency of the present the fact that each passing moment is the one moment for the practice of freedom

in this marvelous dispensation of the fulness of times our opportunities to give of ourselves are indeed limitless but they are also perishable

if time is money and you wasted my time then give me back my money

friendships  and indeed most relationships  are measured in the closeness of hearts

minds and soul ties not in the distance of physical miles or even the passing of time

i spur my horse past the ruined city

the ruined city that wakes the travelers thoughts

ancient battlements high and low

old grave mounds great and small

where the shadow of a single tumbleweed trembles

and the voice of the great trees clings forever

i sigh over all these common bones

no roll of the immortals bears their names

money is time with money i buy for cheerful use the hours which otherwise would not in any sense be mine nay which would make me their miserable bondsman

the future toyed with us it was up to us to try to enjoy the game but not everyone liked the game or they werent given the tools to play

now we realize that time is our most valuable resource and every minute we spend in one of these meetings just sitting there is time wasted

everyones time is limited what matters most is to focus on what matters most

joblessness is a time for reflection

time neither flies nor sleeps it is flexible plastic ever changing spend two hours watching a movie curled up with your lover and time ceases to exist spend two hours waiting for your lover to come and time is the iron bars of a prison

you must always be proactive

you can never know who you really are or what you can do until you discover yourself

i listened to time clicking like hooves on pavement but time isnt something you can rein in it moves on without pause taking us with it no matter how much we wish it otherwise

a job shouldn’t be a mean of existence but rather a means of sustenance

you must add value to yourself to be relevant

time passes way too slow when youre waiting for the unknown

only is a bird doesnt swim in the ocean but flies in the air can it enter the ocean from above only because god is not temporal can he enter into time

if ever i was running it was towards you

i love him in ways that i can’t explain to other people they don’t understand… it’s not their fault

i really believe that there is an invisible red thread tied between him and me and that it has stretched and tangled for years — across oceans and lifetimes i know that it won’t break because our souls are tied

i just want your voice aimed at me again i want to absorb the direction of your eyes…

everything hurts right now and nothing is helping because as the pain is getting worse — so is the love

if you have time to whine then you have time to find solution

dont interpret anything too much this is time waster number

accidents are not accidents but precise arrivals at the wrong right time

i want you to trust yourself baby love is all that matters and you’ve always known that you’ve known since you were a very little girl what your life is meant to be about…

the world is on fire time is a bomb

ten thousand years are not enough

when so much remains to be done

keep the faith the vision is always for the appointed time be patient prayerful and wait for the fulfillment of your visions

never waste time for someone who doesn’t bother to spend time with you but with someone who will say time is wasted if i’m not with you

many were the steps taken in doubt that saw their shapeless ends in no time those who travail in faith today will truimph in joy tomorrow let faith lead the way

why did they go away do you think if there ever were such things

who knows times change would you call this age a good one for unicorns

no but i wonder if any man before us ever thought his time a good time for unicorns

three things you cannot recover in life the word after it’s said the moment after it’s missed and the time after it’s gone now you know

art is long and time is fleeting

and our hearts though stout and brave

still like muffled drums are beating

funeral marches to the grave

back then we gave it our all we neither lied nor made mistakes we didnt fail and didnt do anything wrong

its just thattime has passed and changed it all

there is nothing more powerful than truth it is undeniable and should always be appreciated the truth gives you unlimited freedom to be who you are and express how you feel the truth offers you peace of mind which is something we all love

time is denials mortal enemy and is always victorious against it

its weird how i am constantly surprised by the passage of time when its literally the most predictable thing in the universe

there are times that one treasures for all ones life and such times are burned clearly and sharply on the material of total recall i felt very fortunate that morning

a warrior of the light is never in a hurry

time works in his favor he learns to master his impatience and avoids acting without thinking

i used to think i had all the time in the world to do everything i wanted but whats the use of having all the time in the world if youre always wasting it on things that dont mean a thing

money should not dictate how i live my life

i must take charge and become the master of money so that i decide what i want to do with my time

what a slut time is she screws everybody

the idea of the future pregnant with an infinity of possibilities is thus more fruitful than the future itself and this is why we find more charm in hope than in possession in dreams than in reality

it is early early morning its that time when its still dark but you know the day is coming blue is bleeding through black stars are dying

no matter how happy i had been in the past i do not long for it the present is always the moment for which i love

you put your time where your priority is

our names were made for us in another century

time eventually positions most photographs even the most amateurish at the level of art

max had once read in one of his fathers books that some childhood images become engraved in the mind like photographs like scenes you can return to again and again and will always remember no matter how much time goes by

the power of hope even a lack of ambition can for a time pay off as a necessary facet as long as hope outweighs it

the passage of time will usually extract the venom of most things and render them harmless

what will happen will happen there is time for miracles until there is no more time but time has no end

time itself made all things rare

all you have to do is choose the right day the right weather and you come upon a hidden place in the morning light where time stopped long before you were born

my own eyes try to sleep but they dont they stay wide awake as time snarls forward and silence drops down like measured thought

without space there is no time

i am talking to you but the moment i am talking to you the universe is being created and destroyed

the hours here are flat and round disks of gray layered one on top of the otherthey move slowly at a grind until it seems as though they are not moving at all they are just pressing down

time old cold time old sorrow settling down in layers like silt in a pond

we may be living past and future lives at the same time we are living this one

i always wanted to know what it is right maybe we know each other from time immemorial if you know that in you is the eternal energy of goodness which is most important for you

what was the constant

movement yes with time there was always movement the setting sun the dripping water the

pendulums the spilling sand to realize his destiny such movement had to cease he had to stop the flow

for some it was a great healer the ultimate fixer of bad breakups shakeups and heartache…

time is like a barber it shears you first and then shows you your own face in the mirror marrying nusrat

the tiny lilliputians surmise that gullivers watch may be his god because it is that which he admits he seldom does anything without consulting

between ennui and ecstasy unwinds our whole experience of time

we live in a moment of history where change is so speeded up that we begin to see the present only when it is already disappearing

is that all time is  our perception of how quickly it does or does not pass

the nostalgia of a moments love can be an illusionary precipice from which we fall from truth in heartbreak what we escape to in the past is what tortures us in the present

why i like timetables because they make sure i dont get lost in time

time was a film run backward suns fled and ten million moons fled after them

‘it might be just some trend that came and went’ i said ‘but for us it’s our life

time is just quantified eternity

the only currency that we really have to spend during our lives is time everything else is just a subcategory

your mind is the knife that cuts the continuum of space and time into neat slices of linear experience

esoteric things progress not according to time but by activity they can be slow or quick depending upon the efforts made

you may have the dark and cold street life ruled by the lessor light of the moon during this time i restore my temple and later awake to greet the awesome radiance of the sunstar

because you can text while doing something else texting does not seem to take time but to give you time this is more than welcome it is magical

you are not meant to serve time time is meant to serve you become the master of your now

it is still this moment and that will be true of every moment that follows assuming this moment ever ends which if i am lucky it wont

the people who are close to allah worry so much about wasting time that they call themselves to account for every breath they spend  how many of us wonder about how we spend our day let alone each breath

what is far is very close and what is close is very far

you chose to live here now you should try to live in the present

an english girl might well believe

that time is how you spend your love

it is always worth itemizing happiness there is so much of the other thing in a life you had better put down the markers of happiness while you can

im sure the highest capacity of storage device will not enough to record all our stories because everytime with you is very valuable data

when hes here hes always reading he says books stop time i myself think hes crazydont tell anyone but when he reads something that he likes he gets real happy turns on the music and dances by himself or with a broom sometimes

you knows dat in new orleans is not morning til dee sun come up

as for time all men have it in abundance

id better not

a man leaned over to a man in a pub

and said in a voice

‘i used to be thirty seven but now i’m fifty one’

and that’s how the years go

like somebody is almost at the end of a bag of crisps

and they tip the bag up

and it’s as though they’re drinking crisps

that’s how the years go

is dust immortal then i askd him so that we may see it blowing through the centuries but as walter gave no answer i jested with him further to break his melancholy humour what is dust master pyne

and he reflected a little it is particles of matter no doubt

then we are all dust indeed are we not

and in a feigned voice he murmered for dust thou art and shalt to dust return then he made a sour face but only yo laugh the more

memory is not an instrument for exploring the past but its theatre it is the medium of past experience as the ground is the medium in which dead cities lie interred

most of our lives are crucified between two thieves yesterday and tomorrow we never live today but the time to live is now it is today

had i realized at the time that for austerlitz certain moments had no beginning or end while on the other hand his whole life had sometimes seemed to him a blank point without duration i would probably have waited more patiently

do i have your permission to be a supernatural god if i want to open heaven and in a moment in time touch the heart of a daughter and supernaturally break all the darkness shame and torment in her life may i do that

the pathway traced with blood and tears

and dust of all our fathers dead

fade to the mist of nameless years

the testimony of the suns

a little while their hunger unfulfilled

the mothlike worlds flit round the guttering sun

when you live forever and dont age it gives you time to hope

on the whole i try to keep modesty and willie in timeless settings which is why i avoid all the latest slang and inwords it wont be long before brill sounds as dated as super does now uncle happy

tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow

creeps in this petty face from day to day

time is funny lately nothing to do with clocks

you see valentin there is no such thing as time its just a road a path to travel on most of the world is on a train traveling forward all the time speeding toward death with a set schedule and someone else in charge

smartass disciple what were said for things before the time exist

master of stupidity no words to be said by no man at no time at all

time was spinning numerous threads for its tapestry some to be woven together some to entangle or fray others merely to perish and pass away

eternity is the stopped heart of time

who knows the life which does not burn its own time moments

smartass disciple where were all things before the time began

master of stupidity what was the time before all things created

there is more time than there is expanse of the world and so any voyage at last will end

you dont get time

you create time

when a man has little time he must take care to maintain his calm we must act as if we had eternity before us

our romance shall be…

ill paint it

cause your love transcends the realms

defeats any measure of time

and lasts forever

fragment from utopia chapter hope

time is in fact a cross to bear it passes on inexorably and remorselessly destroying everything in its wake save art and works of the intellect

a selfish life isn’t god’s purpose for you

it’s quite certain there are places to which the whole past is as though attached on which are traced in secret letters for people who are centuries removed from us their thoughts their will…

let us strive together to part with time more reluctantly to watch the pinions of the fleeting moment until they are dim in the distance and the newcoming moment claims our attention

time is the single most important resource that we have every single minute we lose is never coming back

there would be a time when you will ask for nothing but life

use time to create the nature of god in yourself

knowing what to do with time is the key to being productive

time is information we dont have time is our ignorance

your daily actions should be productive

understanding the value of time is understanding the true essence of life

trying to please everybody is what youll soon get tired of because as time goes on those youre pleasing will get tired of you

the way we assess time as humans determines what we become

you have to discover how best you can manage your time to carry out your work effectively

be what you must because who you are is all of us

time interacts with attention in funny ways

at one extreme when ruth was gripped by the compulsive mania and hyperfocus of an internet search the hours seemed to aggregate and swell like a wave swallowing huge chunks of her day

at the other extreme when her attention was disengaged and fractured she experienced time at its most granular wherein moments hung around like particles diffused and suspended in standing water

time is the empty space that allows knowledge—let alone wisdom—to grow

money without time is next to meaningless

you get diminishing returns when you are restricted to your comfort zone

don’t just be a deliverer of yourself but a deliverer of your whole nation

you have to discover the needs of the people you want to minister to

you need to use the instrument that the people desire to captivate them back to things that are right

do not do anything local as believers whatever you do should be magnified to be comprehensive

when you increase and multiply you get much more influence and reach beyond your imagination

our goal in life is to bring the kingdom of god to people and help change their lives

don’t just bring religion to people but also change their value system

take love to people and teach them to abide by the principles of god

teach the people the word before converting and baptizing them

reveal to the people and make them experience god first before you make them church members

always be the light do not wait for others to take responsibility

a purposeless life is a meaningless life

once you are saved you have to locate your own territory

the essence of life is fulfillment

after you discover your purpose you have to build a platform for your calling

don’t just make use of a gift look inside you and maximize others

you must be able to bring relevance to people

no human was created without a purpose

don’t be too stereotyped be ready to explore new opportunities

to work for god effectively you have to expand and stretch yourself

you have to bring relevance to people before teaching them the ways of christ

locate the needs of the people and find out how best you can help them before bringing them to christ

we were all created differently each with hisher calling and purpose

there is a huge difference between living a christian life and living a religious life

your life would never have a meaning if you don’t have a goal or purpose

a life without concrete product is a meaningless one

the purpose of the church is to reveal to the people who god is

the goal is not to be delivered of your problem only but to be an instrument of god

you shouldn’t live for yourself alone but you must also learn to live the christian life

what you do with your time on a daily basis determines what values will be added to your life

evaluate and assess your life on a daily

your race against life must yield effort for you to be productive

always spend your time adding value to your life

you need to invest time in understanding and discovering yourself

a product should be made intentionally

life should be measured with product

you need to live a productive life

always evaluate and determine the product of your life

always ask yourself what you have achieved within a given time and the product of your life

maximize the time you have through hard work concentration and research

don’t act based on religion always have a purpose and focus

life is a race against time

your race is your diminishing life

don’t allow your life disappear into an abstract mirage

to build yourself is to add value to your life

always be intentional and purposeful in life

losing your job gives you the ability to decide what product each unit of your passing life should produce

joblessness gives you control over the product of your life

the only way to live a life without regret is to make sure each unit of time that passes is being converted into product

measure your life by the product and value you produce daily

be conscious about life and time in order to maximize your time effectively

always account for each unit of passing time

you’ve got little time on earth make each day count

always make positive use of every second and minute

createadd value to your life on a daily basis

your destiny lies in your hands and can be molded with each passing day by the choices you make

we were created by god to carry out and fulfill his divine purpose for our lives

we were created to purposefully live a life that glorifies god

we have to discover the essence of our creation for us to carry out our purpose as believers

if you are working with no vision to be own your own boss you are no different from people who are unemployed

to waste time is to lose life

the most successful people in the world today are entrepreneurs

to be productive effective and to live a life of understanding and wisdom is not to waste time

surely even those immune from the world for the time being need the touch of one another or all is lost

channel your energy into your godgiven purpose being out of a job gives you all the time you need to grow

getting fired from work does not make you a failure letting it take control of your life is what does

a job should only be a stepping stone to being your own boss

for you to be successful in your promised land you must study the land

you must develop your skills around your calling

knowing what to do with time is the first step to take when you lose your job

time must be converted into product

to know what to do with time is to convert a day

to convert a day is to produce a product

the best way to assess yourself is to base the assessment on the product you produce daily

never let employment hinder you from fulfillment

time wasted can never be compensated

time spent effectively can be compensated

when you invest in life you are being fruitful and productive

always invest your life in your calling and purpose

life is in time seconds minutes and hours

times precious waste it wisely

to lose time is to lose life

what you do with your time daily is essential for spiritual and physical growth

time should be assessed as seconds minutes and hours so as to be maximized effectively

to maximize time is to make sure that every second minute and hour counts

every minute hour and hour that passes daily should be converted into product

every unit of time that passes daily should be accounted for

never let a day be your control factor

time should be reproduced and multiplied

your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a selfillusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone

your personal truth is your gift to the world

i’m in no hurry the sun and the moon aren’t either

nobody goes faster than the legs they have

if where i want to go is far away i’m not there in an instant

time passes so fast make time to be still

how baffling it is that we imagined cities incinerated by alien bombs and death rays when all they really needed was mother nature and time

its been  years now and i havent smiled at him even once

after many years we were still at that first stage still

preparing to begin a journey but we were changed nevertheless

we could see this in one another we had changed although

we never moved and one said ah behold how we have aged traveling

from day to night only neither forward nor sideward and this seemed

in a strange way miraculous and those who believed we should have a purpose

believed this was the purpose and those who felt we must remain free

in order to encounter truth felt it had been revealed

the unchanging

sunswept beaches with a light wind blowing

from the immense blue circle of the sea

and the soft thunder where long waves whiten—

these were the same for sappho as for me

two thousand years—much has gone by forever

change takes the gods and ships and speech of men—

but here on the beaches that time passes over

the heart aches now as then

one day we were born one day we shall die the same day the same second

you got to insist on your success resist every obstacle and persist in times of difficulty and you will get there

love is circumstantial we can love anyone if need be and losing the one we love is the singular catastrophe time does not heal it every present moment yearns for even the roughest past

the creation of the world did not occur at the beginning of time it occurs every day

this is going to take forever

i wouldnt mind spending forever with you zaid winked

what was closure if not a clock not an end as everyone imagined but a beginning

why are some things easier to remember the more time has passed since they occurred

only in sleep

only in sleep i see their faces

children i played with when i was a child

louise comes back with her brown hair braided

annie with ringlets warm and wild

only in sleep time is forgotten

what may have come to them who can know

yet we played last night as long ago

and the dollhouse stood at the turn of the stair

the years had not sharpened their smooth round faces

i met their eyes and found them mild

do they too dream of me i wonder

and for them am i too a child

time wasnt passing so much as kneeling beside him in a torn teeshirt disclosing the rodentnosed tits of a man who disdains the care of his oncecomely bod

god speaks to you all the time  have you tuned in to the cosmic vibrations of love harmony peace and truth unless you quieten that blabbering little mind of yours you won’t be able to listen to the divine music that plays on and on

just for one heavenly second shut your eyes ears and mind to the cacophonous noises of this physical illusionary temporary world exit all the drama

just for that one heavenly second stay quiet and simply listen listen to the ambrosial sound it vibrates with joy

you can have more of this soulful peace in your life if only you choose to align yourself with the source of love and light the more you stay attuned to home the less you’d wander invain

time is but an illusion created by beings with limited perception

arriving someplace more desirable at some future time is an illusion this is it

i dont think a single one of them had any clear idea of time as we at the end of countless ages have they still belonged to the beginnings of time—

the passing time is painful i have lost the art of moving simply naturally within it i am swept back against its flow angry vindictive it pierces me all the time all the time with its spikes

peter sank id give anything to see time

money is far commoner than time when one reflects one perceives that money is just about the commonest thing there is

in the end nora there’s only time all we have is time…and even if this wasn’t happening we still don’t ever have much…no one does we only have the moment we’re in we have right now

and there is neither beginning nor end nor past nor future there is only a present at the same time static and ephemeral multiple and absolute it is the vital ocean in which we all share according to our strength our needs or our desires

how much time not as much as i had yesterday

i know that your soul is on life support and that you feel lost and like you’re completely spinning out of control but you’re finding yourself — here tonight… even in this darkness

what is this life if full of care

we have no time to stand and stare

no time to stand beneath the boughs

and stare as long as sheep or cows

no time to see when woods we pass

where squirrels hide their nuts in grass

no time to see in broad daylight

streams full of stars like skies at night

no time to turn at beautys glance

and watch her feet how they can dance

no time to wait till her mouth can

enrich that smile her eyes began

a poor life this if full of care

we have no time to stand and stare

he paused

its zero hour now

he did not waste time in a vain search for a place in history

time passes yesterday has gone for ever but tomorrow never comes lets make the most of today

there is only as much space only as much time

only as much desire only as many words

only as many pages only as much ink

to accept all of us at lightspeed

hurrying into the promised land

of oblivion that is waiting for us sooner or later

when every minute of your day is planned  you are packed for days

you shall soon realize that the pain of past fades vision of life gets

clearer and all that seemed to poison your life ceases to exist

lead up to this day

and its just like every day

thats ever been

sun goin up

and then the sun

it goin down

how obvious can it be  the purpose of makeup is to defy the degradations of time and time is just a synonym for death

i miss being the age when i thought id have my shit together by the time i was the age i am now

a real dreamer must have a mutual trust with time

time flies over us but leaves its shadow behind

god is busy and has no time for you

and there was that trick he did with time making it speed up when we were together and drag til i saw him again

it is vain futility to analyze the algebra of time

time the spaces of light and dark had long since lost orderliness

promise is more worthy than time and money

it is futile to spend time telling stories about the fleetness of each day

we spend too much time keeping up with celebrities theyre living their dreams what about you are you where you want to be in life get off the couch turn off the tv and start achieving your goals

was then not all sorrow in time all selftorment and fear in time were not all difficulties and evil in the world conquered as soon as one conquered time as soon as one dispelled time

time doesn’t change anything that is why we still worship asshole arabs

time is just going on and on but i still here idle just waiting for someone and nothing else

please give it up fear it no less than the sensual passion because it too may take up all your time and deprive you of your health peace of mind and happiness in life

having himself spent a lifetime unsuccessfully trying to prove euclids postulate that parallel lines do not meet farkas discouraged his son jános from any further attempt

time owed an alliance to the undying

then you must reconcile yourself to the fact that something is always hurt by any change if you do this you will not be hurt yourself

time is the mercy of eternity without times swiftness which is the swiftest of all things all were eternal torment

time will tell i suppose or at least these pages will

life could be horrible in the wrong trouser of time

the past is a distraction a source of envy enmity bitterness only the present matters for only in the present can we shape the future

cut loose the past it is dead weight

let the extirpation continue let it never end

time spent in india has a extraordinary effect on one it acts as a barrier that makes the rest of the world seem unreal

contemplation is a luxury requiring time and alternatives

time was a dazzling lie a magician worth a bird in his hat the truth i felt certain was that everything happened at once how old was i i was every age at the same time all the days of our lives were today

from time to time

i once wondered how one wanders from time to time

and think up the paradox line

speak of epochs crime

oh i lied it hasnt happened yet

but bet you better believe its such a habit that

i just said that in a past mindset

i finished the blog post reflecting on the fact that despite all the changes in my life maybe i wasnt so different after all if i typed it maybe i could believe it too

an unhurried sense of time is in itself a form of wealth

i could tell you of occasionally every eon meeting a person with whom i might stay for a billion years but what of it after a billion years there is nothing left to say and you wander apart uncaring in the end

he was thinking of that time the way one does on long journeys when rootlessness and boredom lack of sleep or routine can summon from out of nowhere random stretches of the past make them as real as a haunting solar

a territory is only possessed for a moment in time

everything in life had a purpose and unless it achieved that purpose it was just taking up space on the planet and wasting everybodys time

d d

complex systems can arise

from simple rules

its not

that we want to survive

its that weve been drugged

and made to act

as if we do

while all the while

the sea breaks

and rolls painlessly under

if were not copying it

were lonely

is this the knowledge

that demands to be

passed down

time is made from swatches

of heaven and hell

if were not killing it

were hungry

sir henry fixed him with a keen eye

you dont think we could be related

tom looked up at his greatgreatgreatuncle and smiled

i dont think so

no grinned sir henry no of course not

until we can navigate in time im not sure that we can prove that what happened is real

the inertia of a jungle village is a dangerous thing before you know it your whole life has slipped by and you are still waiting there

time hangs off me like molting skin

no time to see in broad daylight

streams full of stars like skies at night

no time to turn at beautys glance

and watch her feet how they can dance

no time to wait till her mouth can

enrich that smile her eyes began

could be

the action

executed in the mind

before and after

where does mind end

we mark a break

with what has come before

come through the door

down the hatch

not a clean break

our life was rehearsal

so that we believed

we would escort her

to the future

where she could be happy

for our last shall be the recorder of eternity

light — ie space — is the structure of time the essence of existence the stuff of physics does not involve time orthodox contemporary physics sadly refers to this fact as the problem of time

the present is a point just passed

the smoke detectors began to ring for they were batterypowered and thus still functioned just as a record can still be played after the death of every member of the orchestra

time is the most valuable coin in your life you and you alone will determine how that coin will be spent be careful that you do not let other people spend it for you

tell me something do you believe in god

snow darted an apprehensive glance in my direction what who still believes nowadays

it isnt that simple i dont mean the traditional god of earth religion im no expert in the history of religions and perhaps this is nothing newdo you happen to know if there was ever a belief in animperfect god

snow hesitated but his attitude no longer showed any of the wary reserve of recent weeks

there was manicheanism

nothing at all to do with the principles of good and evil i broke in immediately this god has no existence outside of matter he would like to free himself from matter but he cannot

snow pondered for a while

i kept on

we already have snow said sarcastically novas and supernovas according to you they are candles on his altar

if youre going to take what i say literally

what gave you this idea of an imperfect god

i dont know it seems quite feasible to me that is the only god i could imagine believing in a god whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purposea god who simply is

brass shines with constant usage a beautiful dress needs wearing

leave a house empty it rots

funny that we live in islands of hours and we never seem to have time enough for anything

time after time have nations ay and rich and strong nations learned in the arts been and passed away to be forgotten so that no memory of them remains this is but one of several for time eats up the works of man

we are like fruitflies measuring everything in terms of our own lifespan but since our lifespans are so short our perspective is entirely wrong

god who inhabits eternity sees things differently he knows that our lives are just a mist we should trust him it was not that long ago that jesus came and it will not be that long before he returns

time for us began to be measured by moments when we spoke and moments when we longed to speak again

he was thinking what a long and wide thing time is to have so many happenings in it

with time comes perspective

though why should we expect age to mellow us if it isnt lifes business to reward merit why should it be lifes business to give us warm comfortable feelings towards its end what possible evolutionary purpose could nostalgia serve

what is time

a childs vacillating mouth

a leftover halfdrunk glass of water

were not really conscious of what were doing most of the time

these were reflections that required some time to soften but time will do almost every thing…

i dont know what happened to me he said shaking his head i honestly dont

you grew up alex

time is precious so use it wisely in every area of your life including having a relationship with god throughthe door jesus christ no one knows how much time that they have to live so dont allow time to run out on you

good plan freddy was saying lets get some decent sleep tomorrow we can shake our gravy asses into town and do some sluething

dry snow coming down in the hills

magpies hairtriggered and thuggish in worn trees

a wall has started to fall in you it will take years to land

times a goon right isnt that the expression

it turns out there is only one possible thing to do in this circumstance to wait the only way there is to wait through eternity and that is through creativity

the clock sweats out each minute

of what meat is left to us

in the first of our conversations you explained how different time was for you—how it’s an abstraction some hours glide past like birds others are slow plodding behemoths stubborn and unwilling to leave

i could give all to time except  except

what i myself have held but why declare

the things forbidden that while the customs slept

i have crossed to safety with for i am there

and what i would not part with i have kept

names turned over by time like the plough turning the soil bringing up the new while the old were buried in the mud

you have carried a branch of tomorrow into the roomits frangrance awakened me

there are only certain intervals of time when life of any sort is possible in an expanding universe and we can practise astronomy only during that habitable time interval in cosmic history

time is a master of ceremonies who always ends up putting us in our rightful place we advance stop and retreat according to his orders our mistake lies in imagining that we can catch him out

is there anything more plausible than a second hand

the calendar is a human invention time does not exist on the spiritual level

mr trask do you think the thoughts of people suddenly become important at a given age do you have sharper feelings or clearer thoughts now than when you were ten do you see as well hear as well taste as vitally

before she continued her search she sat in his revolving desk chair and wept for the passing of time and the necessary death of the wellloved wise old man

soiled forgotten coats of arms were carved above their massive doorways and these unsettled ted such universal defining symbols made meaningless by nothing more than time

get busy with the issue in this regard time is not friendly…nor should it be

and the time sundials tell

may be minutes and hours but it may just as well

be seconds and sparkles or seasons and flowers

no i dont think of time as just minutes and hours

time can be heartbeats or bird songs or miles

or waves on a beach or ants in their files

they do move like seconds—just watch their feet go

tickticktick like a clock youll learn as you grow

that whatever there is in a garden the sun

counts up on its dial by the time it is done

our sundial—or someones— will certainly add

all the good things there are yes and all of the bad

and if anyones here for the finish the sun

will have told him—by sundial—how well we have done

how well we have done or how badly alas

that is a long thought let me hope we all pass

the gnomonss shadow falls where it falls  and so do we where we are now is where a lifetimes worth of steps have taken us

any clock that can track this sideral schedule proves itself as perfect as gods magnificent clockwork

whats fame after all it can be what someone writes on your tombstone

she might have been pretty when she started out but the world had moved on since then

time is simply the measurement of human progression against that of existence

it was nice to borrow a slice of extra time

our mind has its own ideal time which is no other but the consciousness of the progressive development of our beings

if time is precious no book that will not improve by repeated readings deserves to be read at all

for heidegger boredom is a privileged fundamental mood because it leads us directly into the very problem complex of being and time

time is the mind of space

i must reluctantly observe that two causes the abbreviation of time and the failure of hope will always tinge with a browner shade the evening of life

confronted with the choice between having time and having things we’ve chosen to have things today it is a luxury to read what socrates said not because the books are expensive but because our time is scarce

i think i have many spenglerian moods about the country and that some day people will look back and think this was a really goofy unadmirable stupid time

changes is the mother of time

absence of changes makes no time

he had never been a social man he had shunned causes with contempt and disgust they were for pigsimple suckers and people with too much time and money on their hands

we pass through time from birth in order to have from where to come together with death

what a greater crime than loss of time

drugs engineered to affect ones sense of time chronodecelocotropic drugs have no short term effect but over time give one the impression that time feels longer chronoaccelocotropic drugs have the opposite effect

i know none of time’s cardinal pillar on which it says forever just because eternity is not time anymore

it had to do with the way women throughout time has known the feel of love when it came to them

you know the horrible life of the alarm clock – it’s a monster that has always appalled me because of the number of things its eyes project and the way that good fellow stares at me when i enter a room

time and space are awash here

on the church vaulting above was the clockface of eternity void of number and serving as its own hand only one black finger was pointing and the dead wanted to tell the time by it

there is no necessity to live by the clock

theres nothing crueler than time it stretches when youre in pain flies away if youre happy and crushes you when you remember all the years that are now gone

creating more time is not logistical but attitudinal

when day by day the days gets passed as the good or bad days it’s a mistake to expect better days without being better ourselves remember the reach of the day is as long as our dedication  commitment makes it

temporary can mean six seconds or six years and you never know because temporary never feels temporary

a statement can be truthful when it is said or written but untruthful when it is heard or read

we woke up running always

bound to lists schedules appointments

we were broken into seconds minutes hours days years

time never allowed us to be whole

and we became as artificial as time itself

time doesn’t offer a refund

its not true i havent changed

in my dreams

you are twenty always

how green was my valley then and the valley of them that have gone

the right moment will never exist until and unless you create it

the need is just to put the right piece at the right place at the right time

calendars dates and clocks were just not an accurate way to measure some things

lost money is not lost beyond recall but loss of time brings on the loss of all

and thats how it was that night

shadow and space earth

and time

something that runs and falls

and passes

and thats how all the nights

go over the earth

leaving only a vague

on the earth

muffles its sound

the forest sleeps the waters

the meadows

the bells

the eyes

i hear you and you breathe

my love

we sleep

time is always the price we pay for the unlived life

there is not necessarily a correlation between how much time or effort a thing demands and how important or useful it is

a few minutes wasted regularly can amount to over a year within a decade

the past of authentic history indeed was but it is by no means over and done with it is not done with because it is not done with us and because we are the historical beings that we are we are not done with it

being off the clock implies time freedom yet time freedom stems from time discipline you must know where the time goes in order to transcend the ceaseless ticking

the practice of staying present will heal you obsessing about how the future will turn out creates anxiety replaying broken scenarios from the past causes anger or sadness stay here in the moment

i do she says and it is time we get him out of your head he doesnt belong there

introverts are also more flexible in a sense in that sometimes they must do what extraverts do all the time meet strangers and go to parties but some extraverted people can avoid being introverted turning inward for years at a time

every time i see a baby my heart dances with joy and my mind appreciates her for taking us into the distant future

whatever the claims of memes to be regarded as replicators in the same sense as genes the first part of this chapter established that individual organisms are not replicators

always take time to celebrate achievements whether great or small

do not let the mortality of a moment hold you back from living an eternity in that time

she stared at me like day stares at an hourglass and night the sand trickling through time the sea disappearing to eyes in the dark but i hear her waves coming in as she whispers one last chance goodbye

grief as a lowgrade fever his sadness is a hive at the back of his head he moves slowly to keep from being stung things bunch together smooth endlessly out

the road back

the car is heavy with children

tugged back from summer

swept out of their laughing beach

swept out while a persistent rumour

tells them nothing ends

today we fret and pull

on wheels ignore our regular loss

of time count cows and others

while the sun moves over

like an old albatross

we must not count nor kill

there is no word for time

today we will

not think to number another summer

or watch its white bird into the ground

today all cars

all fathers all mothers all

children and lovers will

have to forget

about that thing in the sky

that will get us yet

if you want to save time be honest if you want to save your life be courageous

the ancient and the modern blended together in haunting harmony the war looked like a dream here a fantasy dwarfed by the sands of time

take time to be kind to others

time is the mother of all fundamental forces of nature

time is the mother of dimensions

the proper study of god is the nature of time

time is the unified fundamental force of nature

time is the only player who you should trust

once very long ago time fell in love with fate

some of us would take our time if we knew that we are rushing to our deaths

even most of those who really never have time to read a book usually have more than enough time to listen to one

and then he  tchaikovsky  turned towards the little lectern that was on the stage picked up his baton and held it in the air he paused a moment it was like watching an old wizard with a wand summoning the energy needed to cast a spell

time slowed inside that moment

then the music began

welcome to your very first lesson she was happy to announce before we begin i have one question to ask you can anyone tell me what the difference is between a wound and a scar between weakness and strength and between hatred and love

emerelda raised her hand is it time she asked

how did you know that tangerina asked

shes an hour late and shes dressed in clocks emerelda said i figured it was a safe bet

so be very careful how you spend your time there is nothing more precious in the twinkling of an eye heaven may be won or lost man will have no excuse before god at the day of judgment when he gives an account of how he spent his time

music is about time i told her it is about controlling time

a kiss she said is like music it stops time if you feel for someone just one single kiss can stop the sparrows they say do you think that can happen

time is an abundance that continues on we fabricate a false construct to control it

time spent in the presence of god is fulfilling

all these nows happening at once and if all our nows happen at once then death—it’s just a scavenger hunt through time

time is everything speed is of the essence

time doesn’t offer a refund we don’t get to try on the future the way we try on a bathing suit and then decide we don’t like it once we see what it looks like in natural light

every year has an expiration date as does every lifetime even the finest wine can’t age forever

words will never oxidize

when we sing we can do anything—change the world bring peace be our best selves at last when we sing our hearts can lift and fly over the troubled waters and over the years

you could not have wished to be born at a better time than this when everything is lost

deep inside each carried fear and stress and worry about illness and time which came each day like a conscientious gardener to trim off a bit of their lives

im sorry arty she whispered into his ear

sorry for what

for everything for the last few months i havent been myself but things are going to change time to stop living in the past

artemis felt a tear on his cheek he wasnt sure whose tear it was

one cannot help but wonder what used to get the huge portions of our attention that are now gotten by social media every single day

the will to work must dominate for art is long and time is brief

she realized then that time passes but the imagination remains even if it does not seem to exist elle comprit alors que le temps passe mais limagination reste même si cela semble ne pas exister

and so time goes on as it should and events that were once fated to happen are left instead to chance and chance never falls in love with anything for long

miguel angel he said it isnt hard to die everybody does it even flies do it everyone here is doing it were all terminal he had a tear in his eye big angel could see it brimming your schedule is just different from mine

he glanced at his watch three twentyseven in the afternoon more or less with a rolex hed discovered more or less had to be good enough

better to be stoned in the plaza than to turn

the mill that squeezes out the juice of life

that turns eternity into empty hours

minutes into prisons and time into

copper coins and abstract shit

only a photographer can stop the time

just by one click

the hells move in cycles

no man can see his own end

the gods have not returned they have never left us

they have not returned

gazing on a trillion stars each reticent mankind sells itself the illusion of accomplishment

it’s time of the year when life slows down it’s time for slow guitars and symphonies it’s time you sit on the old wooden chair and bask in the old memories

time is the real karma

i walked into a hotel  after going the menu i ordered some food

after about mins a group of guys walked in  ordered theirs to my dismay these folks got served first

i even overhead one of them bragging about how hes connected to everyone in the hotel

unable to take it anymore i called the waiter

he calmly told me urs is a special order being prepared by the chief chef himself

theirs orders were prepared hurriedly by novices because the top chefs are busy with yours

i calmed down  waited patiently

shortly after my meal was served by  waiters

unknown to me the owner who happened to be a long lost friend saw me when i entered and decided to surprise me

she changed my simple meal to a fivestar meal

the party at the other table were shocked

such is life

some people are ahead of you eating now laughing at you talking about how they are smarter wiser and better than you how they are well connected blessed have money and are enjoying life

you are waiting tirelessly wondering why its taking so long to breakthrough you endured mockery and humiliation

dont you worry

yours is a special meal it takes time to prepare

wait and relax

from the present we move into the present everlastingly

the tide can turn any time

revenge is ravaging try not to plan it

karma will surely take its course

but when u see karma is taking too much time act yourself

karma might have planned you for that role

another senior librarian i interviewed that day told me that seeing the library in ruins so traumatized her that she didnt get her period for the next four months

but where is the wolf the wolf is like the copo de nieve

the boy looked down at the thin and ropy claws that held his hand the light from the high window had paled the sun had set

the future crashing into the present like a wave

walking does it for me all the time

it helps my body and also my mind

am i mad or am i just in a time warp

waste no time to worry about your want

i tried to conjure alis frozen face to really see his tranquil eyes but time can be a greedy thing  sometimes it steals all the details for itself

if you change the way your brain processes an event you change the duration of the ‘now’ you actually change the point at which the present becomes the past

many times we give beautiful names to our miseries and catastrophes and thats how we lock down the memories inside us from which we always want to escape

below the trees

in the woods

i while away time

there is no such thing as ‘i do not have the time’ this is all just a matter of priorities

the time they take to say i love you should tell you how much they mean it

take time out to be kind to others and kindness will find its way back to you

it seems a very dangerous idea it is — all great ideas are dangerous that it was christ’s creed admits of no doubt that it is the true creed i don’t doubt myself

our time is finite instead of always managing the shit out of it let’s give ourselves permission to slow down and savor it

the best gift you can give anyone is to spend quality time with them

on the road where change is continuous and visible time is not rather it is something the rider only infers time is not the travelers fourth dimension  change is

soon he was back out on the streets he wandered around manhattan aimlessly for what he thought was weeks instead it was months months turned into years

we are all in the hands of time

follow the time since time follows no one

he could not turn back the clock a second nor could he ever push it forward a second so that what happened had to happen

your time is not free how you decide to use or not use your time will be paid at the end of your life

getting through time was rather the problem the cry of help me — but there was no one there

night will fall on us all and the coach will pull up

so some might imagine that i am an expert on time although of course these days an expert is not necessarily a good thing to be

whenever i see a homeless person on the street i think ‘that could me me in a few years time’

whenever i see a homeless person on the street i think ‘that could be me in a few years time’

celebrate friday by celebrating life

theres time this lasting forever

there is no more important thing in life than balancing this is how much we deal with work sport spirituality family if we forget one of these things all the rest is going wrong all you need is an acceptable state not perfect

humans were not meant to be whisked to and fro like this my grasp of time and space was simple linear uncomplicated

in eternity there is no time for anything to begin or end therefore past present future represent a linear progression that goes nowhere

the momentary circumstance was too strong for him he failed to look beyond the shadow scope of time and living once for all eternity to find the perfect future in the present

i’ve learned that people say they can’t put their goals at the center of life family time travel faith health but they have no problem putting work there at their expense if that hurt good change something

revelations reach us at times of out lives when we lack the courage and commitment to act dutifully among them

it had no end and therefore no beginning yet it progressed thus it was timeless infinitely present and so could be taken to be a representation of time which cannot be pictured by those who imagine themselves linear subjects to it

entrepreneurs start projects to free their time only to create a prison of time

time is an illusion it is a limitation created by our minds if we stop measuring everything and just enjoy every moment given life is going to be a lot more exciting

time doesn’t measure friendship bonds and feelings do

time is a concept invented by men who didn’t want everything to keep happening at once time is irrelevant

the time has come to stand up and to defy

its our life our choices how long can they deny

the time has come not to believe in every lie

not to follow every rule without asking why

the time has come not to ignore as others cry

or soon very soon it will be our turn to die

the time has come not to turn a blind eye

because once lost freedom is hard to come by

i thought again about the miracle of time its manifest cruelty and sublime mercy

disorder increases with time except evolution

how would a creator god experience time

i think it would be through his creation

how could the dimensionality of time change with scale there is only one way as a fractal

what do you think is future a realm of possibilities not realities

past is always receding away the future is drawing nearer and the present continuously changing renewal of present gives credence to this commonsense

the changing nature welcomes the duration perspective of the present and ends up with the nonexistence present ie switching of time from absolute nonexistence to absolute existence and back to absolute nonexistence

time itself is a mystery beyond our understanding however we always strive to know it

each of us seeks to find our waybut from time to time we get off trackbut something amazing goes off inside of usand we come running back

moments in time are the true origins of the fabric of reality

waves are everywhere in the existence of time matters and beyond everything as well which is defined as an illusion if we can convert it to energy traveling beyond thoughts possible t∆nv€€®

stop waiting for someday someday is a myth dont wait to have the time start planning to make the time

your time is now unleash the genius within

haste makes waste but a lazy mand rather get his work done fast than do it himselfall it saves is time son and what good is time with nothing to do you want to sit and twiddle your thumbs all these stormy winter days

i think time in itself is consciousness

through experience i have learned not to waste my time trying to convince corrupt corporate government officials of the truth

doubtless there is a desire in human beings to exist everywhere in space but there seems to be a much stronger desire to exist everywhere in time or at least in future time

the human mind has a different attitude towards time and space as regards the survival of the human race

some people including hawking think that we may be able to understand the big bang or the big crunch in particular whether time has a beginning or an end at these events when we have a satisfactory quantum theory of gravitation

one of the most intriguing problems is to understand the precise nature of time especially with regard to the big bang the big crunch and the longterm future of an open universe

time is a continuous doubt when you don’t have time know you are in doubt

the spiral i ventured

yes yes or the helix they are our models of the passage of time he said

so time moves on but history repeats itself

precisely he said

we plan to frame the time finally time wins to frame us know yourself before he does it again

a pax day and night lasted about twenty earth hours and a pax year about  earth days a year seemed like such a long time

set not thy heart on any good or gain life means but pleasure or means but pain when time lets slip a little perfect hour o take it  for it will not come again

and sometimes thats just what happens people grow apart

go forward slowly its not a race till the end

looking through the veil cosmos is a beautiful thought patterns repeating fractally into micro and macro cosmos other lives resonating in ours and sometimes they feel like simbolic presentation of our subconscious reality in this existence

it is very often to find a past life experience fractally mirroring in this life when youre really one with the heart of the cosmos its all beautiful colorful patterns repeating variating themselves through eternity

in time it wasnt all that long ago but measured in events it was an eternity

if you make time for everybody more people will make time for you

delays and laziness are the two great gulfs in which multitudes of souls are drowned and perish

let destiny here play its role

its not time in your life its life in your time

lonzi said the only thing worth loving was what was to come and since what was to come was unforeseeableonly a cretin or a liar would try to predict the futurethe future had to be lived now in the now as intensity

sometimes when you give people too much value and respect they think they’re better than you

time the forgotten fundamental force of nature

free time allows building of reputations — either as someone who is excellent at killing time by doing nothing or someone who can utilize the time by creating things out of nothing

people becoming habitual to doing nothing get nothing at the end

time is not a luxury sensuality is

time governs the laws of physics

the rose was red

the color of love

its petals vibrant

a sign of your love

its stem did twine

around my heart

but it couldnt keep it pumping

one day it failed to start

as clouds parted

we only had our memories

to remember

our love would last

but time went on

your love did change

and so the rose

began to change

petals did fade

my rose was wilting

showing its age

red was no more

black was the hue

without your love

what was i to do

i tended my garden

the thoughts in my mind

for you were still my love

for me in my mind

like a white stone at the bottom of the well

i cannot and i do not want to struggle

it is both joy and suffering

i think that anyone who looks into my

eyes will all at once see him

more sad and pensive hell become

that heard the story of this suffering

i know that the gods had turned

people to objects without killing mind

that divine sadness lived eternally

youre turned into my memory i find

the treasure that you seek is hidden in time

i’ve done much too far to be looking back

time will heal all our wounds vengeance will fix our scars

time and effort can get you anything you want in the world but nothing in the world can get you more time

for a moment time started it flickered into existence like a guttering candle

it needs efforts to catch time on time

when we give our attention and love to anything in life it is a significant offering we only have so much time what we spend it on and who we give it to will determine the course of our life

the smart phone is a really amazing device but it is a bad idea to hold one next to your brain for extended periods of time

time and effort can get you anything you want in the world but nothing in the world can get you more time

it is disappointing to witness the corporate government disability system letting massive numbers of sickened people down during their greatest time of need

people get a lot of time to waste and a little to invest

time is relative it is both arriving and passing away

two o’clock was missing

it made the air heavy and the sky appear frozen as if the town were being forced to slow down until the next hour

the most painful moments make us truly want to escape from time but the most profound joy rarely makes us hold on to time forever

time  money many of us have neither some have one but not the other a rare few have both

god gives us all  hours in a day how we spend it is up to us how we are judged on it is up to him use god’s gift of time wisely

on the day of judging the miserable

in the hour of doing their task

it is painful when the accuser has knowledge

do not trust in length of years

they view a lifetime in an hour

cloth will keep color best that is dyed in the wool and the vessel will scent longest of that liquor with which it is first seasoned oh then remember your creator in the days of your youth

your goals and dreams will never happen if you don’t sow labor into time

every time there is a mass shooting in the usa i wonder if the shooter was an insane masturbator

depression is pretty much a mismanagement of time

the prison of time is truly fascinating the decisions you wish you could undo played a part in bringing you here and empowering you to wish they could be undone

it shamed her that she hadnt been able to escape sooner that theyd stuck together in such a sickly codependent useless sort of life

sometimes it takes a very long while to figure things out

that does not slake thirst is not wet

youths gone  like a sunday prayer

is it mine to forget

on how many desert roads have searched i

with him who wasnt dear for me

how many bows gave in church i

for him who had well loved me

ive become more oblivious than inviting

nothing will give me back him

patience is a byproduct of growth  we can bide our time when it is the time of our growth there is no patience in

acquisition or in the pursuit of power and fame nothing is so impatient as the pursuit of a substitute for growth

then she’d straightened up and announced in irritation i’ve fallen out of time before vanishing in a great cloud of smoke

dont wait for the coffee or the eggs or the shmuck in the front row to tell you how it is youll wait your whole life and then end up in an embankment with a heart full of sorrow and i could have done it betters

the way i see it time is a con artist the con artist telling you that this isnt a good time you should wait the right time will never exist like so many of the things we think are perfect and in the end turn out to be just ordinary

the most profound property of time is that nothing lasts forever at the same time time itself is probably eternal now isn’t that a paradox to ponder over

what started time and how much time did that unknown phenomenon take to start time

i guess my cognitive abilities and withering brain plasticity cannot grasp the placement of time as a dimension in an equally difficulttograsp theory of relativity

whereever we go whatever we earn

the time we waste can never return

the mistakes weve made are now to burn

into the bonfire of guilt and wrongdoing

will we ever learn to stop pursuing

those temptations of life that minds are wooing

to start succeeding in a specific area you need fucking huge action to take… to invest time… less eating… less sleep… less time wasting…

are they nothing at all the cries of men

does nothing happen in time but time passing

nothing happens only the flickering eyelid

of the great sun hardly a movement nothing

the unredeemable boundaries of time

the dead are all pinned down by their own dying

they cannot die again of another death

they are untouchable locked in their gestures

and since their solitude and since their dying

this only they can do stare sightless at us

their death is simply the statue of their life

perpetual being and nothingness without end

a king of fantasy regulates your pulse

and your last gesture carves an impassive mask

and lays that sculpture over your mobile face

we are the monument raised to an alien

life a life unlived not lively hardly ours

save that space because

i need the time to disperse my rain the day ahead is

still long yet longer than the days behind and

weeks lost between that we used to use to have discipline

technology is a wonderful thing it brings everyone so closer that you can actually see the distance between them the infinite distance

photons that travel at the speed of light must have no concept of time

we can afford to waste most things but not time

we experience time by perceiving through our senses things that change in a completely stationary world the concept of time will not have any meaning

kai laiko turi be galo niekas nebėra ypatinga be netekčių ar aukos mes nesugebame įvertinti to ką turime

kokia to priežastis

music is about time’ i told her ‘it is about controlling time

it is time to end the insanity that calls itself very high altitude astronomy

the flow of time stops for no one once a moment passes you cannot go back and change it not with science not with divine interventions

i wish i could unpick the stitches of time that have become all tangled and twisted together

it is time to demolish the biologically toxic mauna kea observatories mko

nothing is older than time there is nothing newer than the present moment

and everyone is alive somewhere in time

the moments between your milestones are not filler

i touched the frame of the painting and then i placed my whole palm on the dry rumbling surface of the canvas simply to prove to myself that there was no god stalking my soul time was not immemorial things were just things

understanding that time is limited helps to motivate the use of each moment to the best advantage to achieve things of value

once there was once there wasnt

once there was once there wasnt gods creatures were as plentiful as grains and talking too much was a sin for you could tell what you shouldnt remember and you could remember what you shouldnt tell

the right thing at the right time only happens when we stop searching for the right time everything becomes right when we decide to make it right time never decides the choice  determination factor it just moves on

once there was once there wasnt

once there was once there wasnt gods creatures were as plentiful as grains and talking too much was a sin for you could tell what you shouldnt remember and you could remember what you shouldnt tell

time is a great healer but a lousy beautician

at the end of your lifes journey what do you want to say you did with your time there is enough time if you choose to invest it in yourself inch by inch day by day    make yourself a priority

the heart of every person is infected with the jealousy of love it works exactly like a sleeping volcano that rises at the right time

there is no time all things exist simultaneously all events occur at once

this book is being written and as its being written its already written it already exists in fact thats where youre getting all this information  from the book that already exists youre merely bringing it into form

this is what is meant by even before you ask i will have answered

time is experienced as a movement a flow rather than a constant it is you who are moving not time time has no movement there is only one moment

it is not time which passes but objects which pass through and move around in a static field which you call space time is simply your way of counting movments

scientists deeply understand this connection and therefore speak in terms of the spacetime continuum

the aim of demanding quick responses or decisions is to limit time to consider options

repeated enough times even the most obvious obnoxious lies become to seem like the truth

maximizing time doesnt mean rushing around like there is no tomorrow

but there is no use blaming time

for in destinys path time too is only a mute spectator

time appears to rush by without any concern for its impact upon you

my time begins with my death

a day can pass as a day

the major cost in life is the time wasted that cant possibly ever be replaced

over a lifetime there are vast amounts of available time that on analysis are wasted

time on the surface doesnt seem to cost anything where in fact time costs a lifetime

unlike a good wine knowledge or information doesnt age well soon becoming obsolete or less valuable with the passing of time

memories that cease to be painful are still nostalgic and nostalgia made her sad always about a loss of time

daddy says that one day all ill think about is people i used to know

the phenomenon of music is given to us with the sole purpose of establishing an order in things including and particularly the coordination between man sic and time

seize the day and make every moment your own

perspective heals us perspective empowers us and if we let it perspective will make us wiser we are often built by the same things we thought were destroying us

we are everywhere and nowhere

we all have  minutes of life today how what or who will you spend it on choose wisely you have  left

she can’t move forward or backward she is stuck in time a constant

it makes sense good things take time

the god who holds everything together that god is nothing more than time itself

not a thinking acting entity a physical law

with which one can negotiate as little as one can with ones own fate

god is time and time is not merciful

we are born and our life is already trickling away like the sand in an hourglass death is forever inevitably before us our fate is nothing but a concatenation of cause and effect

in light and in shadow

even if a particle could travel backward in time information could not retrocausality will be replaced by something more sophisticated

the arrow of time says that everything is moving from the highest possible symmetry to the most likely outcome

work to support your lifestyle dont live to support your work

each one of us here is waiting for a time in our lives that would change our time forever

perhaps the hardest thing about losing a lover is

to watch the year repeat its days

it is as if i could dip my hand down

into time and scoop up

blue and green lozenges of april heat

i can feel that other day running underneath this one

like an old videotape

we always have the time to do the things we want to do and to be the people we want to be we just need to choose to do it  to make the time to do it

time is the art of nature

i am changing the world one quote at a time

look deep into nothingness  then you will understand the nature of time better

time is the eternal state of matter

time is the source of all resources

the atoms or elementary particles themselves are not real moments in time are real

there is one thing stronger than all the fundamental forces of nature and that is a moment in time

he thinks perhaps there’s a reason our memories are kept hazy and out of focus maybe their abstraction serves as an anesthetic a buffer protecting us from the agony of time and all that it steals and erases

i spend most of my time with my friend called failure and i really enjoy it when my best friend called discovery drops by for an occasional visit

the things not taken seriously are the things which causes seriousness in our lives we wait for a right time to decide the time for taking things seriously but the time never waits it has a tendency to slip from our grips

grief grinds slowly it devours all the time it needs

we are all amateurs at grief although sooner or later every one of us will lose someone close to us

time isnt the main thing its the only thing

we are approaching a time where the masses will become wise and stop supporting the toxic pursuit of knowledge of space and instead demand the closure of these biologically harmful industries

during my time in high altitude astronomy i became aware of workers having gender issues many years later i discovered that sex hormones were affected by high altitude exposures

successful people don’t use the obstacles of time education and money as excusesthey use them as leverage to get help⁣⁣

in this book time thus flows in a tempo opposite that of real life the tempo slows down as the years go by

we human creatures can make watches and clocks and sensitive timing devices but we don’t understand what we’re timing

sometimes doing work at own time  pace kills the timely impact it may have on the result needs are timebound and our decision to time them as per our convenience results in a loss of time  connection with the customers

during my time in high altitude astronomy i was never informed that i was working in an abnormal radiation environment for the sea level adapted human

it could have been mere minutes or long hours it had felt the same to her then the seconds catching in her throat waiting with her breath before she forced them out forced time to move

i am truly happy for people who have depth and can see beyond the present not spiritually now but in terms of process and knowing that anything and everything good must take time

i am truly happy for people who know that you must sow before reaping

i am truly happy for people who know that you must count  before

i went to an organization today and spent most part of my time there

i watched this organization grow and also recruited for them apart from using the place as set for oma living show

they were occupying a small space in one of the phase  districts in abuja

today they are occupying a big edifice all by themselves and to say i am proud of them is an understatement

i am happy for the team members and staff who did not run away because of small salary like most of us will call it

they have been there and growing with the company

they will be called lucky for having this job by the same people who carry shoulders up and quote things like i know my worth i can’t work for less than  million naira per second

they will be called lucky by those who sit and complain about unemployment day in day out while rejecting every job offer on account of the most flimsy and watery reasons

but i will always say it

some people simply decided to face reality and abide by certain principles

many authentic beginnings are small

but most don’t know it because they want to make it overnight

but i am happy at the revolution that is happening

this is a good time to embrace process

time is the truest

you do the best you can

and let time testify

theories become truth when tested by time

your time is precious and your company is unforgettable

hear me cried the ghost my time is nearly gone

wealth and income without lifestyle is a waste of wealth and income better to be poor with a life than rich with none

a moment in time is regarded as the true fundamental building block of the universe

the universe is expanding into new or extra dimensions of time

an ultimate extreme level of a moment in time which is nothing but nothing or nothingness that is nothing is regarded as the true smallest unit of time and also the most fundamental building block of the universe

the friend that i spend all of my time with is called mental illness

there was a time that made in america was a great thing unfortunately times have changed in some areas that the usa specializes in

nothing is immune to time not even eternity

time was not flat and linear but layered and interconnected a circle that retraced its path again and again generation after generation shearing the same space if not the same sphere

when there is time

the time travels

to have it as your friend

you need to travel with it

let it flow

feel the currents

resist the pull

and then

close your eyes

and let go

don’t be a slave to the money be a slave to your passion

if youre going to have a story have a big story or none at all

then no sin matters he said no sin achieves evil

sometimes in life bad things doesnt really mean its entirely bad but it rather gives space for the right option

i don’t like getting involved with other people’s business i don’t have time for it and yet here i am listening to myself say four dooming words leave everything to me

the past can be changed through books and forgotten memories

the whole futurei thoughtwill be that way life lives together with the damp odor of the land of the dead attention with inattention passionate leaps of the heart along with abrupt losses of meaning

the wave changed instantly by rock the rock changed by the wave returning over and over

shoot sparks of green and grey

through time

over time wonder replaced fear of the hawaiian visions

mindset is knowing that time will eventually reveal what is making you sick

three oclock three oclock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do a peculiar moment in the afternoon today it is intolerable

it would seem we are to suffer an apocalypse of cockatoos  william gull

a time like that comes for every man when he choses what sort of man he wants to be and if you dont know the story you dont know the man

i dont think something can constitute a journey unless it leaves ones world looking different than before

time had sneaked in and stolen her recklessness

timelessness is an art

make your work laser focused to create asymmetrical success and increase your time and personal freedoms

the highest and best use of your time isn’t always something you like but something you like can be the best use of your time choose wisely

life is nothing more than moments in time to achieve greatness you have to give up those moments you have to give your life to your goal

after lunch  one short nap

on waking up  two cups of tea

raising my head i see the suns light

once again slanting to the southwest

those who are happy regret the shortness of the day

those who are sad tire of the years sloth

but those whose hearts are devoid of joy or sadness

just go on living regardless of short or long

after lunch

time and habit had taken the wrongness out of almost all the acts he had once thought sinful he performed them as unenthusiastically as he would have performed the act of catching the morning train to the city

the hardest part of ending each month is going through the last  days

do not waste time on the past this is a subtle matter from which you can weave anything

law of attraction  — the basics

don’t waste someone’s time if you don’t want them wasting yours

the alchemy of time transforms everything into comedy everything even crucifixion

perhaps it was a case of time overflowing

future can alter your past too perhaps no wise man has told this before

love comes and goes pitching its mansion and on the circular track of days it appears that dread is gaining on devotion every second

time is clock of the universe

he was hoping that things would work out well

there are no particles there are only moments in time

a memory is a ledge on the mountainside of the mind there we are drinking and chatting and on the ledge below us my dad sits in his chair dead his face smeared with blood

this is time time laid bare coming slowly

into existence keeping us waiting and when it does come making us sick because we realise its been there for a long time

when we see the reality which can’t be explained by our existing faith and beliefs we drop or modify our beliefs and try to understand the world by using our renewed beliefs our faith is not hardcoded but changes with time like a living entity

when your kids have school summer holidays and you can match your schedule to meet their time demands for the entire holiday period that is your money at work for you  aka financial freedom

the hardest part of the end of each month is last thirty days

the hardest thing about the end of the month is the last  days

time changes so does bae

whenever i’m not writing time trudges forward with the maddening mortifying miserable morose moribund pace of a funeral procession

now and then the passage of time seems acutely apparent physical pain always sharpens the awareness

if you are not happy today it is because you have not performed the right actions at the right time in the past

dont be afraid of the future as its always uncertain your mind and hands together can make your future better so dont spend time thinking while doing nothing

time wipes successes that easily achieved and cheap

red white love the love of liverpool fc

time will sweep us away but our words will remain long after we settle into the dark

and once youve got clocks youve got death and dead people because time as we know runs on and then it runs out and dead people are situated outside of time whereas living people are still immersed in it

there can’t be any formula for happiness because happiness is an effect and not a cause the same activity which at one time gave you happiness may now become a source of suffering or often a great suffering ends up becoming a source of joy

when we close our options at some point of time we learn to be happy with what we have however when we keep our options open we are rarely happy with what we have as we find the grass greener on the other side of the fence

warning if you do it right the first time theyll ask you to do it again

isnt it suffocating to keep waiting for life to get better all the time

the truth is somewhere in the middle of each thing which you read in its in the middle to find it you need time but time in its the essence right now

i am neither in time nor out of time

red white love the love of liverpool fc

moving forward is not always easy or pleasantbuttime marches onand we have no choice but to march with itwhether we want to or not

times onward march is just another spoke in the wheel of life

in time they have lost their personalities and begun to resemble each other

red white love the love of liverpool fc

time is a remedy for all troubles and it cures all wounds with its kind hands

red white love the love of liverpool fc

a trustworthy person will not promise what he can’t deliver however you can’t deliver what you promise unless you know yourself know others know the rules of the world and take the right action at the right time

only forever

and nothing

time is all messed up forevers are seconds words come too soon or too late some stories last forever others seem to come only yesterday… or tomorrow strange isn’t it time has gone mad

mindful is remembering that being alive is the ultimate gift when we know we have a limited amount of time were more careful how we spend it

all goals take time to be accomplished think a hundred times before setting up your goals however once you decide don’t change the goal in a hurry don’t abandon goals after you have travelled a long distance on them

ive climbed up here holding the hilt of times sword by driving it into my tender heart

may i discard the outer cover of time from the layers of poetry by immersing the poet in its entirety within me

i survived something i shouldnt have final thoughts its about time ive made mistake but im gonna go out right rufus emeterio

time was dead in the air

time trailed off into death and over this dead time a silent snow was falling

i cant interfere with my own past because that would mean id be interfering with my own past to stop myself from interfering with my own past then where would we be  th doctor

if we begin to die when we live and long life be but a prolongation of death our life is a sad composition we live with death and die not in a moment

to be nameless in worthy deeds exceeds an infamous history the canaanitish woman lives more happily without a name than herodias with one and who had not rather have been the good thief than pilate

it took me a long time to learn how to love myself but i cant go about convincing others to do the same

read to go

getting up means leaving i say

nah leaving means living before you die lets bounce

step by step inch by inch time paced around my mangled body it circled me slowly inspecting the scene taking inventory

a person made time for people and things they cared about

an unfortunate reality is that most people are unhappy most of the time unhappiness is so widely

pervasive in the modern world that if you tell someone that you are happy people are unlikely to

believe you it is because we have stopped accepting that it is possible to achieve happiness

i know time doesnt heal thats the silliest idea of all

we all are sailing in the same boat called time which is heading towards death

the minotaur comes and goes he has for centuries and there have been many bridges

it will take your lifes time to realize if the love is true or not

when time changes the law also changes to suit the new rulers often the same people who were being accused of heinous crimes like treason according to the then laws become the martyrs and messiahs when the laws are changed

live in peace and be free

when possessions own your heart

you are enslaved to money and to corporations

your time is owned by the moneylenders

and they will not let you spend it freely

they will tell you what to buy but not

what it will truly cost you

you will be held ransom

what is your heart worth

what about your time

what holds your heart holds your attention

what holds your attention holds your time

what holds your time holds your life

and if its possessions that holds these things

it will demand it all

for the morning glory eternity is a day for the redwood a thousand years

time marches on but

torturing silenty the rest

of our days

just as the invention of air travel had made it easy to go but no easier to leave the invention of time travel made time easy to pass but no easier to endure

no estimo

please god whatever i was i am no longer…all is forgotten if not forgiven—it could have come to that but i don’t trust the thought i don’t know if it’s because it would be too easy or too terrible to imagine no one cares anymore

time creates nothing and everything

i had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised

that look on his face could break the hands off a clock turning time into something weightless and slow

and what happens when all the threads of the tapestry have been traveled do you then go over them again and again in an attempt to relive the best parts because nothing will be like that first experience nothing

the science of decorating time with harmony and art that will leave a mark to be forever embraced by philosophers of every century is the penultimate of a mans inner peace and eternal happiness

theres a time for taking yourself seriously its just usually never the right time

life is short but the days are long so move slowly and take your time

time is not necessary for healing but it is generally inevitable

gravity and time are local and they are maintaining the balance in the bubbles however anomalies in the local gravity fields and times can destroy complete planetary systems and civilizations

you may have a million reasons not to get started now in a month or a year or five years from now you may have only one regret  that you didnt start now

life is an argument with the world over time

all motion is time in motion

we dont really grow up our toys change with time

when something moves you can tell that time has passed not till then until something moves time is eternal  thats why time doesnt pass for the hanged man because even if the childs hand moves he doesnt know it

the only way a man could defy time was to leave behind buildings that would not die

death distance and time shall each one of them dig graves for your affections but this pi do not know nor can know until the story of your life is ended

death distance and time shall each one of them dig graves for your affections but this you do not know nor can know until the story of your life is ended

by fate by destiny said the vermonter by the fact that time runs in only one direction and we are borne along by it influenced precisely as we are to do just the things that we do the bass lisper said

and i still walk the sidewalk mumbling

something about how it will all be fine

fine is its own crazy village on the rhine

fine is the name of the cuckooclock maker

fine is the word the cuckoo cries

every hour after hour on the hour—

scrambling out of its dark little hole

like something being chased with a knife by time

time is made for dying in a thousand ways so why be afraid of dying when a kind of dying could come all the time live every day like youre terminal because you are live every day like your soul is eternal because it is

your time is limited  so dont limit your life by wanting someone elses

it seems to me that one of the great luxuries of life at this point is to do one thing at a time one thing to which you give yourself wholeheartedly unitasking

hours hours and hours snap up our pleasures

many things may face extinction with the passage of time but some things will never go extinct for instance the printed books and the classrooms

today is a hard day sometimes there are hard days days stretched so tight with pain that they seem as if they can allow no room for hope

saturday morning and i am at the old game of catching time between my fingers as it is running forever running away

time is nothing but everything

wait for now

distrust everything if you have to

but trust the hours haven’t they

carried you everywhere up to now

personal events will become interesting again

hair will become interesting

pain will become interesting

buds that open out of season will become interesting

secondhand gloves will become lovely again

their memories are what give them

the need for other hands the desolation

of lovers is the same that enormous emptiness

carved out of such tiny beings as we are

asks to be filled the need

for the new love is faithfulness to the old

don’t go too early

you’re tired but everyone’s tired

but no one is tired enough

only wait a little and listen

music of looms weaving our loves again

be there to hear it it will be the only time

most of all to hear your whole existence

rehearsed by the sorrows play itself into total exhaustion

time passed turning everything to ice

under the ice the future stirred

if you fell into it you died

it was a time

i lived in the present which was

that part of the future you could see

the past floated above my head

like the sun and moon visible but never reachable

it was a time

governed by contradictions as in

i felt nothing and

i was afraid

i was young i said to myself i have life in front of me

as i got older i said to myself i have life behind me

sick i said to myself i do not care as long as i have life with me

since then life is always with me

neither in front nor behind nor before nor after

i stopped offering it on the altar of time i brought life back to life

scientists had always doubted the accuracy of measuring time and thus they had never confirmed the correct time with a hundred percent accuracy philosophers however always knew what the correct time was now

i am now convinced that nothing or nothingness is actually time

time exists beyond the standard model

the stars move still time runs the clock will strike the devil will come and faustus must be damned

winter is nearly gone time flows on to a spring of little hope

we learned that we should not count the birthdays after the age of  after that time is not the highest priority for learning

here we do not believe in wasting time simply for the purpose of impressing others

inside me the taste

of things unspoken dries my mouth

slow as lean cattle in some long drouth

the pleasure is unique and the one that reaches its effect will remembers it later joy is proper to being it does not cease its durability and has no time to end

say my daughter and her boyfriend meet again if they have a child will it be lucas the odds are astronomically against it if it doesn’t happen lucas will die without ever being born

patience is a virtue for who knows its time

ignorance is a waste of time love and money to live

like a twentiethcentury dream of europe—all

horrors and pastries—some part of me for all time

stands in a short skirt in a hospital cafeteria line with a tray while

for the worlds richest man

my mother who is dying never dies

time was a face on the water  like the great river before them it did nothing but flow  the wind through the keyhole

time is not like a chewing gum that you can chew and throw away time is dedicated to being being vigilant the one who rules the nations the one who is triumphant

the tuning of a good singer can be compared to the timing of a classic ballet presentation

our time on earth is a temporary residence

happiness requires us to be better than we are that’s why it lasts for such a short time

there some people who says that games can’t always be played and those who challenge their own limits who has the time to play freely

your start time is based on the things that hold you back

there is time to receive but not time for a decision to get time for the persistent but to make the decision it makes the undecided ones go by

there is so much to do at the moment when we stop and ask for time at the same time we connect the energy that exists within us and we go forward time is not for when you dream change is an incredible opportunity that you really should enjoy

lonely time is the time for a genie to be born into the world it is where truths come to the surface and change becomes their biography

the longer it takes to take a step the less time youll have to enjoy whatever you conquer

quality time is a very well procrastinated time

today yesterday and tomorrow i will live my quality time said the orgasm

they are pleased to deceive themselves as if they deceived fate at the same time

your start time is based on the things that hold you back

what the point of crying over the things you dont have be patience and make the best of what you have in time great things will come

we are all guilty time is the executioner

it seems unforgiving when a good thing ends

but you and i will always be back then

when the time comes youll fall in love sweeties dont rush

he had never seen anyone live so magically and yet leave no trace of it until he met her

relationships develop best in the absence of a previously stated goal and a strict timetable but relationship management means setting goals and creating a plan

as the poetic vision is timeless so the poetic product tends to be so

the poet after all belongs himself to an age and country shakespeare must attempt to present the universal in terms of elizabethan england

gret works of literature are always developed and enriched from age to age with the growth of thought

the lord said time death i am the destroyer of the worlds who has come to annihilate everyone even without your taking part all those arrayed in the two opposing ranks will be slain

our conception of time is based intirely upon our ordinary conscious thought

time has no present or future it is always the past

the dreamer while he is dreaming certainly does not question his dream it is the same with the matter of time

to do nothing is sometimes the best course of action

the time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic the passions expand it those that we inspire contract it and habit fills up what remains

time the critic for whom nothing is ever good enough

write as if time will erase every word

things changing is what defines time atoms vibrate clocks tick the earth circles the sun the universe expands

muscles relax the mind expands the vastness enters into the skin like a shot ‘our’ time dissolves

energy is variation per unit of time at a particular scale

dimensions and scale are not static dimensions could be virtual like the idea of virtual particles but are a form of wave propagation

the mountains stand as if they have been there since the beginning of time

taking time to relax every day spending quality time with friends and practicing mindfulness are some of the tried and tested ways of developing selfcompassion

just as it takes time for the mud in muddy water to settle meditation only yields fruit if it is practiced regularly for a long time

anything that makes you feel alive is worth devoting time to

we should always be ready to explore our positive and negative traits by evaluating our real self from time to time

take all the time you need to analyze your priorities and accordingly decide what is good for you

it is the nature of trauma that when left untreated it deepens over time

all human power is a compound of time and patience powerful beings will and wait

suddenly it occurred to me that maybe the point of writing wasnt just to record something past but also to prolong the present like in one thousand and one nights to stretch out the time until the next thing happened

time is one of the greatest gifts to humankind

we often

• heal with time

• forget with time

• adapt with time

• learn with time

• and even improve with time

so please… take your time

the gift

be still my soul and steadfast

earth and heaven both are still watching

though time is draining from the clock

and your walk that was confident and quick

has become slow

so be slow if you must but let

the heart still play its true part

love still as once you loved deeply

and without patience let god and the world

know you are grateful

that the gift has been given

nostalgia will kill the good girl

the truth is you should not waste your time on being good

time is fractal the density if time is a nested hierarchy of possibility

miranda waited then said but what will i do for a whole year

neither of them answered her she supposed the answer was get better the thought of a slow and measured crawl back to health filled her with black sand

till the time the chains of organized religion remain intact the slavery of mind  soul will reign supreme

accept it rakturan said i am different than the man you first met

so quickly

what is time a thousand years can pass in a single day

do you spend more time looking at your watch than living in the moment

it’s not ‘time’ for god for there was never a time that was not a time for him what it’s ‘time’ for is our realization that we’ve needed him all the time and we just never took the time to realize that

there are  seconds in a day and how you use these

are critical what you do today is to show who you are

nobodys gonna talk about what you did last week

you have given this opportunity to be alive

in your life time it means absolutely nothing

if you dont take advantage of it

this impression is a glimpse not of timelessness but timefulness an acute consciousness of how the world is made by  indeed made of  time

antipathy toward time clouds personal and collective thinking

time is the one thing we can all agree to call supernatural

i saw the priest take note of the time what time was it then i felt his finger on my forehead and i realized whatever time it was that it was the last moment of my life as an episcopalian

time a magic wand i need

to live again that moment when

i was a child and i was sure

that happiness is just a game

that when tomorrow i will wake

just a few things i will need

sun some laughs and enough time

to play to stay forever young

no time to worry no time to crave

i must now enjoy the game

when you find yourself lonely when you’re with them it is time to leave

just give it time time is the only thing i dont have

your addiction is not you but it feels like you because you’ve spent so much intimate time together

some details are lost to time and in fact it’s for the best to ever feel that you understand anything only means that your mind has turned rigid

please remind them that none of us have all the time we think we have in this troubled but still beautiful world

time is the study of god

words like wistfully and sublime are penned into prose and rhyme as night gives way to dawn life gives way to time

time never dies it just changes dimensions

if your mind is working you always have no time

no greater thing is created suddenly any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig if you tell me that you desire a fig i answer you that there must be time let it first blossom then bear fruit then ripen

time makes you therefore be careful with what you do with your time

rewriting time in the orange sky

i wrote you from emptiness i wrote you from nothing when it is there it does not only loneliness dreams of silence desire to perpetuate your face in my memory

i want to read you once more like reading myself once again rewriting time going home to longing when you was still asleep in the folds of memories inside the frame of memory a silent pain was as tight as a moons face

youre crying in time of pain however you might smile in me and the orange sky like to spell your name read poetry in the glint of my eyes

time heals they say

but it’s not true

time does not heal

there is only

the flow of thoughts

maybe time is as fundamental or even more fundamental than material reality

yes you have been away a very long time

oh centuries and centuries so long she said that i’m sure i’m dead and buried and this dear old place is heaven

wednesday makes my world beautiful

time and space are just illusions as such they can be overcome by a focused intention exercised by the power of the mind

back before there was time i lived with my father on an island tucked away in an endless archipelago that reached up out of the cold salt water hungry for air

send not to know

for whom the bell tolls

it tolls for thee

remember the only evidence of time is life and growth

i am one of those who came in search of light but fell in love with darkness

time is the ultimate reality

for very minute you spend worrying about things in life

you lose a precious minute of your life

create a space in life and business for the person you want to become not the person you were⁣

i refuse to achieve success at the expense of my life

once you understand the value of time constraints you life will suddenly be free with freedom you’ll be better enabled to provide joy to those you serve with intentional attention

what will you do with all your newly found available time

but time moves in only one direction not everything that breaks can be repaired

and you and i know that we were lovers since the beginning of time

lions dont worry about what lambs think

invest your time and money in connecting yourself and others

avoid arguing with cynics and pessimists as they will only drain your energy and time

minutes foolish mortal are the base mineral

that you must not let go of without extracting their gold

time is the most powerful healer that heals almost every wound just trust the process take your time and let the healing begin

one touch can say more than all the world’s words that’s true but the touch fades with the years and then we need words again they’re our weapons against time death forgetfulness unhappiness

do you invest your time or spend it

it requires neither time nor money to be kind

since the beginning there has been no wiser sage than father time

because time is not something to be measured with the eyes but by the heart its never too late to go and change

there was never a better time to change than now

if we will not change now then we may not be able to change all

the secret is to enjoy life now and don’t wish away days waiting for better ones in the future

time well spent is like a whetstone it sharpens our minds and refines our imperfections

it costs no money to be kind

it takes no extra time to be kind

i dont want to rot

i dont want time

hold onto your miracle

its just a spark right now

guard it from the wind that blows

ignore the tongues that wag and the clock that drags so slow

day you day the spark to a flame will grow

on a day unexpected the miracle in life will show

did time really flow in such a steady and linear way couldnt this be a mistaken way of thinking an error of major proportions

tomorrow never comes so do it today

we keep waiting for the right time to do what we want to do but time is a complicated thing its never right

they say life is short but that is not true

life is endless and so is time

both are in gods hands immeasurable and wait for no man

it is actually living and timing both measured by a clock and a calendar that are short and will pass away a man may live for  years but that is still short compared to the endless life and time

like the path of a snake on the rock so is living without having life and timing without understanding times  seasons

in living and timing always remember that we will not always be here so let’s make the best use of what we have when we still have it

cursed be the immortal that believed time was more precious than love

what immortal ever knew what it was like to number his days

yet i can feel the hours passing when she is near

time is an illusion that passes way too fast

the moon rose and the moon set

and the stars rushed up and whirled and set

and again they swarmed after a shaft of sunlight

and the dark blue dusk closed above him like an ocean of regret

the present is the merest flicker between the long long time past and the things that havent yet happened but most assuredly will

there is no way of wasting time because what is time for except to be wasted

oh great another weak minded spending time here…

and when you died

i took you down to the river

and when i died

you waited for me by the shore

so it was that time passed between us

i have no regrets in my life but this that we did not have time

some people would not waste any part of today if they knew that by this time tomorrow they will be dead

if something has to be done one might as well do it when one has a lot of free time

time is like a bucking bull staying on top of it requires maintaining focus while riding out the ups and downs of life and work

all things when measured in spans of years seem simple but human lives do not occur in years but slowly day by day a year may be easy but its days are hard indeed

i wasted time and memories on waves

with sleepy eyes

and a sleepy lens

its time to breakfast

as the night time ends

may i take a moment

time is a great healer and a great killer anyone wasting time suffers a lot

relativity in our case means that success is relative to the time frame you choose to measure it with an hour a month a year a decade a lifetime

the less time you have the more you have to take

the world was not ready for their wisdom yet they achieved great things in the invisible universe and their impact would be understood later in the fullness of time

time well spent adds to life well lived

accepting peoples quirks or flaws doesnt just take changing them off your todo list—it also gives you the time and energy to change the things you can

time is the greatest gift that god has given us its free

an instant realization sees endless time

endless time is as one moment

when one comprehends the endless moment

they realize the person who is seeing it

were as old as weve ever been as young as well ever be the time is now

time itself is the best and the only timekeeper

all motion is time in action

we all need quiet time to create the life that we want to live that quiet time nurtures our creativity and helps us deal with the chaos that surrounds us

there’s no time besides now do not waste time in thinking about timetravel

and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont do a thing i ask its always six oclock now

times of mourning displace us from ordinary life

time moved in two directions because every step into the future carried a memory of the past

some stories are written by time and not with a pen

and while all people were bound together by the common space they shared their journeys through time were all different which meant that each person lived in a slightly different world from everyone else

i don’t prove what i had made promises with you time has

taken the responsibilities for this

time you see can be measured in means other than the ticking of the clock

the thing about today is

its monday

no other day could get the week off to such a great start

and my death comes when every soul has loved each other at least once sang the universe

i think i owe you the time you wasted in ignoring me

find me as time is a luxury

for i wait under this naïve moon

you do it one last time and keep doing it forever that

i wish time had better things to do than making me wait

good relationships dont just happen they take time patience and two people getting through all the hard times together

when everything else is right the timing will be wrong such is life

and what has gone forward can’t go back to where it came from

there is no logical necessity for the existence of a unique direction of total time whether there is only one time direction or whether time directions alternate depends on the shape of the entropy curve plotted by the universe

what occupied his full mind was time itself time passing he was concentrating

time goes through all times

time existed before creation

time now seemed to have receded to be an enormous empty room which she must furnish like any other aimless woman with celluloid shadows of other peoples happiness with music that worked one up for nothing

i take another look at the stone run my fingertip over the meticulous brushstrokes and realize that nothing ever returns to time unless it is stored in mute voiceless objects rocks do tell tales after all

a young ticket should never be envied they queue for the bus the same as us

time is money they that value money more than time eventually lose both

you can tell me i’m dead until the words lose their meaning but it won’t change that i’m not and i don’t want to waste the time i have

if time cant heal them nothing can

time went by so fast these days there was some sort of malfunctioning going on with how fast earth was spinning decades went by as quick as years once did

id moved enough times now to know that time was a fleeting exhaustible thing i didnt want to waste it

time is a strange and powerful beast it has a habit of making the impossible possible

it’s  easier to increase your time and freedom by eliminating the dumb things you do every day than to try to be  more productive doing more dumb things

the true fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles but moments in time

i cannot find anywhere in my life a time or a kind of time that is unoccupied i am free but my time is not my time is fully and vitally occupied none of this is spare time i cant spare it  i have no time to spare

time has a way of eternally looping us in the same configurations like fruit flies we are unable to register the patterns just because we are the crest of the wave does not mean the ocean does not exist what has been before will be again

has my life been cheated by the shortness of the time afforded me or is it possible that the greater part of my life has been saved for a time where there is no time

time heals all wounds but waitings a bitch

time makes the carbon a diamond

the phone was laid on a desk thousands of miles away once more with that clear familiarity the footsteps the pause and at last the raising of the window

listen whispered the old man to himself

and he heard a thousand people in another sunlight and the faint tinkling music of an organ grinder playing la marimba— oh a lovely dancing tune

with eyes tight the old man put up his hand as if to click pictures of an old cathedral and his body was heavier with flesh younger and he felt the hot pavement underfoot

he wanted to say youre still there arent you all of you people in that city in the time of the early siesta the shops closing the little boys crying loteria nacional para hoy to sell lottery tickets you are all there the

go labour on while it is day

the worlds dark night is hastening on

it is not thus that souls are won

i have wasted most of the time on social media in doing unnecessary but i dont regret because i know one day i will return to my originality i am me i am me

life is a time journey

when the time is ripened

grace you shall receive

i am not smart i just got the time

most people master the art of wasting a life

time is everyone’s most valuable resource you’re never going to have more of it than you do right now why are you wasting it

i confess i do not believe in time i like to fold my magic carpet after use in such a way as to superimpose one part of the pattern upon another let visitors trip

the faster you move the slower time passes the longer you live

the iced tea was nonalcoholic and the faux cola entirely devoid of cocaine or opiates

there is no speedy advance except at its proper time

every second is a step away from our mothers’ wombs towards our own tombs

in eternity everything is happening for the first time

unless we have good reason to think otherwise it seems that our best guide to the future is a mirror image of the past the nearest thing to clairvoyance is to assume that history repeats itself — backward

doing one thing at a time is a recipe for a life that wont keep up with your dreams

i value my time so much that undressing is the only thing i am willing to do for sex

for we die every day oblivion thrives

not on dry thighbones but on bloodripe lives

and our best yesterdays are now foul piles

of crumpled names phone numbers and foxed files

i have learned how to make time pass but i never stop thinking of you

doing unnecessary things waste time

doing both cause poverty

lonely cries and she was lonely not for friends but for a time that hadnt been violated

time is life imam hasan albanna said whoever knows the real value of time knows life itself for time is life

i had thought that if i kept myself busy time would move faster but no matter what i did every second felt like an hour

unlike the animals who knew only the present man had acquired a past and he was beginning to grope toward a future

without those weapons often though he had used them against himself man would never have conquered his world into them he had put his heart and soul and for ages they had served him well

but now as long as they existed he was living on borrowed time

time heals wounds but when the wound is big time is its oxygen

when time all spare

the burden of war

who wants to bear

cowards what we are

you don’t need more time you need to act on creative intentbased ideas

time spent with family shouldnt be the stuff of big dreams and here was a man savoring the moment when what we were about to share was so natural and such a basic component of who he was

i kill myself every time i have to stop myself from writing more and focus into something else

didnt paintings lie also they showed hours instead of minutes

the universe is a puzzle

life is a problem to be solved

its not what it appears to be

there are doors

there are locks and keys

there are levels

if you get it right somehow it will give way to something extremely unexpected

each day includes one tone of creation that corresponds to one of the  energetic forces and indicates the role and significance of our activity in the manifestation process

god has prepared a path for each of us to go through

you just have to be able to read the signs he has left

the ultimate extreme level of a moment in time is the singularity of a black hole

december  power of free will and wisdom understand how can you use your creativity to empower yourself and make wiser choices

we take life so serious at times worrying about the little things until we get to the end of our lives and wonder why we did

december rd power of adventure and exploring which beautiful adventures do you enjoy that help you to restore balance

your work goals should leave the space and time you need to enjoy your personal pursuits

leave time for your soul to breathe the breath of god today

time as far as my father was concerned was a gift you gave to other people

beneath the stars

your eyes

fragment from beatitude chapter hope

sands of time released my ancient image

to awaken you to the artistry and splendour

of egypt’s camelot

no mystery am i

a modern woman trapped in an old time

go forward beautiful ladies and create

new worlds of artistry and beauty

out of the sands of time

rome fell silently to ruins a new city rose in its place and it was too erased by emptiness like phantom giants cities kingdoms and countries swiftly fell and disappeared into emptiness swallowed up in the black maw of the infinite

from age sixteen to age twenty a womans body is a temple from twentyone to fortyfive its an amusement park from fortyfive on its a terrarium

there is a correlation between how foolish a man is and how tolerant he is of people who waste his time

i chose to

explore the senses of this delightful universe

breathe the sensations of my body with every move

abandon myself in flow and feel compassion

become aware of my existence

and thank lord for his blessings on me…

excerpted from mindfulness chapter resilience

its weird to have him paying attention after years of not paying attention

and i pondered this curiously crazy life

and the things i failed to grasp as a girl

but thought i understood now

as a softer  wiser woman

i thought about life and death

i thought about tonights dinner menu too

time is long death is patient and the ghosts will always outlive the grieving

it doesnt matter how you aim it it cant reach the tree

one who cares only its time not others surely cannot be sincere and trusted

all our yesterdays neatly shelved time cataloged in drawers news grows brittle and yellow under the library in catacombs of paper

i hope time travel doesnt become a reality time would lose its own charm and importance

most of us love timesavers because they give us more time to waste

no matter what the fing time gifts you with

no matter what happens in life make sure there is grace under pressure

what indeed if you look from a mountaintop down the long wastes of the ages the very stone one kicks with ones boot will outlast shakespeare

i have not the time to fight with others i am already in the war against my evil desires that can cause the pain to the entire humanity

eternity is not the inexhaustible sum of all the centuries quite the contrary —it must surely be this absence of time absolute calm which can be more than a little dull

and that’s when i realize that at the end we’d all wish for the same thing just a little more time

telling some people not to waste time is a waste of time

quantum physics tells us that no matter how thorough our observation of the present the unobserved past like the future is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities

the universe according to quantum physics has no single past or history the fact that the past takes no definite form means that observations you make on a system in the present affect its past

life was so short and books so countlessly many

is this my dream or the truth

o would that we had met

when i had my burning youth

but i grow old among dreams

among the streams

the more you do something the easier it gets dont expect it to get easier if youre not putting in the time and energy to make that happen

the realization that time can behave like another direction of space means one can get rid of the problem of time having a beginning in a similar way in which we got rid of the edge of the world

suppose the beginning of the universe was like the south pole of the earth with degrees of latitude playing the role of time

as one moves north the circles of constant latitude representing the size of the universe would expand the universe would start as a point at the south pole but the south pole is much like any other point

to ask what happened before the beginning of the universe would become a meaningless question because there is nothing south of the south pole

how can you even know what you want if you dont know who you are invest the time and energy into getting to know yourself get real with yourself

we have to get through the summer

finn didnt want to get through the summer he wanted to fall into it hunker down and stay for a while

happiness can be found inside our own hearts and not in some shallow relationships people with integrity know how precious time is and they refuse to waste it on people who dont bother to respect it

they lied to her every day saying that she cant fly and the most painful thing about it was she believed it till the end

without truth time is merely the kingdom of the animals time brings progress and humanitarian glory only if truth walks the nerves of our mind as we walk the alleys of space  in that walk we relinquish the space between the self and the other

how can i sing

time tells me what i am i change and i am the same

i empty myself of my life and my life remains

success is built overtime not overnight

time and the wind carry us away we have to leave everything behind

last night we spun dreams from the cobwebs of time

maybe this is life this is happiness and this is everything that ever really matters …

if haunting is anything perhaps thats what it is time in the wrong place

we were meant to find each other here celes he agrees i can feel it like we’ve lived a lifetime together knowing each other loving each other time can’t separate us fade by kailin gow

to measure time one must begin to grow futureward one must root deep into the ground with blood

are you prepared to put in the time and energy to create change in your life are you prepared to make and keep that commitment if not you then who invest in yourself

but oh — time has become such a torture a slow torture one tries to capture a piece of time that lies ahead and is full of light    but thinking about that just makes this awful black time even blacker

our encounter with the moment is also an encounter with eternity

i counted the seconds passing time could go on forever like this i thought again time would infinity loomed consistently and all at once forever with or without me amen

there is no ‘back’ for me my home is gone

what do you mean ‘gone’

changed time makes us all homeless —eventually

in the blink of an eye

youre gone

do you miss me

we were on

grab your chin

with my palm

kiss your cheek

every second that passes is another grain of sand in your hourglass that is gone forever lost in time

time is not a line

and spirals

and is gone

in the oneness

of the infinite

we have all the time in the world we once complained about being overscheduled now were thrilled to bits if theres something to jot down other than a doctors appointment

always take time to cherish every single moment you get and always take a second to remind yourself how special that moment truly is and just how lucky you are to have it remember that there is someone somewhere wishing it was their moment

to a young nun

this undemanding love

that our staggered births

you in your generation

i am not the one

you are looking for

you are not the one

ive stopped looking for

how sweetly time

as we go arm in arm

over the bridge of details

your turn to chop

my turn to cook

your turn to die for love

my turn to resurrect

was that what it was really like to be alive the feeling of darkness dragging you forward

if it is time that you are talking to

don’t forget the path you are walking through

sudden flare of past might stalk you

never allow moments to mock you

clocks are as pointless on the tennessee as poets are on earth

we only think of days and months to keep track of times that arent now fuck days fuck months this was how it was going to be from now on forever

time doesnt rewind it only heals

so much space such silence so much time to drift to think to let your mind roam anywhere it pleases to dream perhaps the true luxury of our age is not the piles of goods we endlessly accumulate but time

with every passing time technology moves one step forward

time is ephemeral but we keep drifting back into it whenever it exhibits its tyranny

when seeking forgiveness remember that forgiveness includes change dont just ask for forgiveness because you are sorry ask because you are willing to put the time and effort in to change

bad memories of the past are like quicksand the more you struggle with them the deeper you sink suffocating in the sands of time

time is a curious dimension  habit of the preconceived notion can easily reverse the hand of a clock and yet the clock is still in perfect working order

o time it may be pitiless or sad

and now and it brutally shakes the earth

if time intends to annihilate you my lad

go boldly forward and fight for all youre worth

is a particle really a wave packet

could something like a phase transition involve dimensions that are more transitory then we imagined

example a photon as a two dimensional sheet is absorbed by an electron so that the photon becomes a part of the geometry of the electron in which the electrons dimensions change in some manner

could scale have more variation and influence on space and time that our models currently predict

time flies when you get what you want and doesnt when you dont

time flies when you dont get what you need and doesnt when you do

time feels interminable when youre mired in regrets ramsey is my diversion

it is never too late to make a change and taking some much needed alone time for yourself to reflect is not selfish

don’t spend major time doing minor things

ruins are more beautiful than adorned castles for ruins are the cathedrals of time

in headaches and in worry

and time will have his fancy

tomorrow or today

concocted by caffeine

a ferociousness that sucks you in

even as it wears you down

we are all migrants through time

time keeps moving forward no matter what youre feeling

in a world of chaos and ticking clocks

live for the moments that keep you still

today is nonrefundable therefore i’d better live it in a manner that a refund is unnecessary

shortlived are both the praiser and the praised and the rememberer and the remembered and all this in a nook of this part of the world and not even here do all agree no not anyone with himself and the whole earth too is a point

they sat in silence watching the river flow in the same direction it always had a ribbon connecting the past with the present and a reminder that time moved on regardless of whether you wanted it too

sometimes what we need the most is the strength to survive in this world which forces us to pay to watch the demons destroy the paradises we built and dance on its ruins

when you do exams always remember the order in which to do the questions

if you do it in any other order you run the risk of running out of time

the time is short twixt now and then

and is never ours to share again

peace happiness and love are a daily practice give time and energy to that which you want more of in your life invest in yourself for a higher quality of life youre worth it

right now is the time of repentance

and today is what i’m living

he isnt a codebase he is a human being and bugs are harder to spot and fix in humans you cant just deploy a fix immediately it takes time to identify the problem and foster and grow a change

time can’t stop the love of moss with a stonesaqib abraham

there is a deep foundation of my being which knows not of time and change and is still and ever with hartley in that good place where we once were

put a little soul in everything you say in everything you do

we still need the old to tell the young that in time they will learn

there was also closeness for the end of a couple is like a death and the notion of death of temporariness can remind us of the value of things

are you happy asked shane without judgement not wanting to make any assumptions

i’m sorry for your losses… offered shane genuinely

the passage of time was relentless and capricious and one would lose the battle with it in the end the only resistance a man could offer was to make the most of time exploit it without trying to prevent its progress

whenever we buy something we do not need we waste not only money but also time

let time move you in love

im writing about the impact of greek sculpture on the french impressionists he said attempting liveliness but it landed like a brick p

truth is that when all is said and done the only thing we end up fearing is time

your time is the most valuable asset with you invest it where you get best returns

god or the universe or whatever one chooses to label the great systems of balance and order does not recognize earthtime to the universe four days is no different than four billion light years i try to keep that in mind

we stand on the edge the fall

into depth the ascent

of light revelatory the canyon walls moving

up out of

colors of the layers cutting

down through darkness sunrise as it

precipitate of the river its burnt tangerine

bleeding above the far rim for a split

you here with me watching day’s onslaught

standing in your bonesthey seem

implied in the record almost

by chance fossil remains held

in abundance in the walls exposed

by freeze and thaw beautiful like a theory stating

who we are is

carried forward by the x

chromosome down the matrilineal line

recessive and riverine you like

me aberrant and bittersweet

riding the high

colorado plateau as the opposing

continental plates force it over

tensed muscular fundament your bones

yet to be wrapped around mine

this will come later when i return

to your place and time

the geologic cross section

of the canyon

from where i stand hundreds

manganese and rust the many varieties of stone

silt sand and slate even green

river rockmy body voicing its immense

into a

depth i am still unprepared for

the canyon cutting down to

the great unconformity a layer

so named by the lack

of any fossil evidence to hypothesize

about and date such

a remote time by at last no possible

you can scotty – you have to bennie said with his usual calm but through his thinning silver hair alex caught a shimmer of sweat on his crown times a goon right you gonna let that goon push you around

scotty shook his head the goon won p

now he turned to her grinning her hair and face were aflame with orange light

see sasha muttered eyeing the sun its mine p

he had to find her

its so easy to take time for granted without thinking about its value and yet here i am on the racetrack where the whistle was blown long time ago

stop blaming other people for your own behavior own the truth if you dont like it then invest the time and energy to change it

most criminals in prison can trace their crime to their first murderous act—that of killing time

i will give you time—and then i will claim your forever

i have no time to love myself since i stay showering love towards others and that breezes and fragrances in my heart and mind

what the clock reads is the measure you set

president trump’s people are merely demonstrating to the world what has been known to fraud researchers for a very long time engaging in lies and fraud is a normal aspect of corporate government

when each minute of consciousness is a burden an extra fortyfive of them constitutes an almost insurmountable tragedy

by time or theft everything you love and value now will eventually be taken from you

i see the string of time surrendered on the wings of neptunes birth where the halfmoon proclaims the divinity’s song with the rise of maghrib

you cannot respect someone but disrespect their time

but we spent almost all our free time together  when we werent in school  and it turns out that who you spend time with ends up mattering more than what you do with that time

time spent in anger is a double edged sword not only is it a phenomenal waste of time it also damages your health and thus shortens the time you have left

love isnt a feeling or emotion that changes timely its everlasting

we often give painkillers the credit that ought to be given to the passage of time the belief that they would kill the pain or the water that accompanied them

forgive people when they laugh at your dreams i assure you

in a matter of time they soon will start dreaming

the tuesday seamstress said

our souls were sewn apart

his days swelled with the monotony of hours piling up in colossal heaps before and after him the used the same as the new

the exploration of self is only enhanced by your expeditions  innumerable odysseys that nurture the mind and soul if finding a purpose is your goal then travelling lies at the heart of it

there is peace in the present when ones aware of how to manage what works for them and what drains them with a calm mind

one cannot skip time but only transcend it through innumerable memories that exemplifies human understanding

the hours in expanded pleasures

i wondered where those roads in which the world diverged

became the promises of another life

the hilly embankment that touched the horizon in

tranquil virescent spikes splattered with hazel lines

that conquered truth and candour

who knew those detached words

bethany winston once told me that time was like a closet no matter what you do or how good your intentions are you will always fill your time and closets with things that dont matter

thats why funerals are so important shed said they force you to clean out closets and reevaluate how you spend your time

you wrapped your wings against my soul

calmly cascaded tears into eternal waters

where i sat in solitude waiting ephemerally

for those hours of lost comfort once again

how long ago did sleep become such an end

we are wasting time

time wastes itself who are we to float in its way

the best investment one can make with ones time is to spend it on happiness

stealing someone’s money is not nearly as bad as wasting their time

its humbling to think how different you would be if you were born in a different time

my childhood love affair didnt die it just vanished women had stopped wearing hats

an oil owner is someone who has claimed ownership of something that has been there for millions of years

everything was changing nothing remained the same space had expanded yet merely rearranged time was stretching far too fast and waiting now to snap if found there is no answer can the quest be taken back

growing up takes time and effort

why do you chop your life into bits and give the bits names hours days it is like a rabbit if i kill a rabbit i eat a rabbit when you have a rabbit you chop it up and call it bones and meat and fur and guts and so you never have enough

the speed of time varied fast or slow depending on the depth of my sleep my favorite days were the ones that barely registered

self discipline punctuality and time management are very important  for life is short and every resource you have must be well utilized so that you find enlightenment and liberation  your ultimate goal

time was a blind rider nobody could unsaddle as he galloped he ravaged all that seemed enduring transformed landscapes reduced dreams to ashes

people are not cactuses they need plenty of water and when talking about friendship the water is our time

what’s wrong with knowing what you know now and not knowing what you don’t know now until later

—winnie the pooh

time is a variable continuum

life would not seem short if we valued time as much as we value money

many millions of people have lost their lives while trying to save a few minutes

there has never been a better time in history to be an environmental radiation researcher

the scarcest resource of all senior managers’ time and attention

if you wait for the right time to come it will never come begin where you are and with what you have

we need to move beyond time management to life leadership

consider what difference would a clear vision of my principles values and ultimate objectives make in the way i spend my time

if you had all the money in the world you couldn’t buy an extra minute

a person can influence a situation or the situation can influence a person

the days since then have been a timeless fuzz i feel time pass but nothing actually seems to happen

do not despair we will glimpse another track we fill find another route the day that is not this will come the time that is not this will be

she was lost time she smelled of dusty libraries and unwound clocks salted sand and rain riding on the first rays of dawn

the fact that the world exists in time and not only in space means that the world is not completed that its creation has not yet reached its crowning consummation that it continues to be created

abortive time unwilling to tarry

daylight begins to hide into the heat

his moonless night desires to be starry

those lame knees want to break down on his feet

from the poem sonnet for a man part i

they refused to live in these moments right now and they got busy in turning everything they come across into a memory which they could visit in the future

we spend so long trying to get what everyone else has that we dont even realize that we all ready have it all

if you want the game you must stalk it that is all you cannot say to stalk this takes too long i wish to simply eat it is all one the stalking is the beginning of the eating

i love you too but my time with you has passed

she wasted my heart my time

time is not just the hands of a clock it isnt just a change of seasons either it is a treasure trove of precious moments infinite little joys and blessings precious smiles tears and heartbeats

all her life she believed that carrying so many things is what made her heart always heavier but there came a day when she finally realized that what really makes it heavier is not having anything there

heroes hate wasting time youre wasting my time theyll say yet they devote very little time to time management and rarely consult a diary

the man or woman you really love will never grow old to you through the wrinkles of time through the bowed frame of years you will always see the dear face and feel the warm heart union of your eternal love

if you live long enough you realise that every proven fact is later disproved and then proven again

overworking is the black plague of the st century

music is the only place where time does not exist

without a calendar where would the week go

time changes our appearancesand our addressesbuttime can never steal from us the memories that shape our lives and our destinies

and last the rending pain of reenactment

of all that you have done and been the shame

of things ill done and done to others harm

which once you took for exercise of virtue

then fools approval stings and honour stains

the oceans the skies and time bow down at the sound of his voice god is so great he deserves all praise

life is a storybook our stories depend on what happens and what doesnt what we know and what we dont what we forget and why thats what makes telling the truth so tricky because the past never stays still it keeps changing into the future

love is pretty much always confusing and it doesnt ever show up at a convenient time

time went on whatever happened nothing happened because she was so beautifully out of contact    time went on as the clock does halfpast eight instead of halfpast seven

time has told me

yourre a rare rare find

for a troubled mind

he held out his right hand in the moonlight from the cut on his wrist the blood was still oozing every few seconds a drop fell dark almost colourless in the dead light drop drop drop tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow

he had discovered time and death and god

giving your time to someone who does not itit will kill you emotionally  kill your happiness and leaving you with regrets

these wheels within wheels

these leaves folded in leaves

these wheeling winds

and winding leaves

those sprockets

from those seeds

this spiral shooting

from that rainfall

what does a turning earth

say to its axis

how should a melon say thanks

or a squash utter blessings

she followed slowly and she needed time

as though some long ascent were not yet by

and yet as though when she had ceased to climb

she would no longer merely walk but fly

what is wrong and heartbreakingly foolish and wonderfully avoidable is to live a life with more craziness than we want because we have less jesus than we need

be patient my little wild one wondrous things take time a pearl is hidden before it’s refined a diamond’s luster is dull before revealing brilliant magnificent breathtaking shine

he did not use these things anymore and yet the thought of letting them go made him sad he felt they represented times in his life he could not recall without their presence they represented stories

the instant passed so fast and when that happens it goes for good and all you have is a slow lifetime to speculate on revisions except time flows one way and drags us with it no matter how hard we paddle upstream

time is a healer time is god

time will take your happiness away

time will give you a reason to live

the wind is stormy

tomorrow it will be placid

but eventually time itself will create a new pathway

what if we fan the

while we get to play

in the dappled sunlight

at the edge of time

the day your souls see their faces or smell their memories in someone elses stories and doesnt bleed anymore you know you have healed

being in a hurry does not slow down time

though shakespeare and his writings did not get much value during his age ‘time’ has aptly given him his due respect later

just wake up and see that all the past is only a memory in the flow of time all events are dissolving

many times a moment can turn your soul waves to welcoming sunny shores

and in that moment all you have to do is to let yourself in the arms of the destiny carried away of the endless time feeling without more other searches

when time is remote enough nobody amounts to much

time and distance

both illusions of the mind

no beginnings no ends

as it has been since the dawn of time the light and dark are linked as one

time is life if i give you a minute of my time im giving you a minute of my life value the time i give you and make good use of it

time is the most valuable currency that we have and yet it is the one that we waste the most

ive lost you again time i will never win this game of hide and seek

time is an illusion say the scientists it is molecular it is bendable or liquid it is soldered metal or it is droplets of memory i imagine it looks like mercury silver and elusiveburn all the clocks i am free

solving some problems requires less than half the energy or time it took to complain about them

sunday owes its existence to the other days in the week

time doesn’t change things it’s how we use our time that makes the difference

who among us dares to assert that our memories are not tainted by time sweetest poison and bitterest antidote untrustworthy ally and reliable annihilator

what do you say that we forget the past forget all that we have been before forget the future even and we simply look to the here and now isnt that all we ever have in the end

we would rarely waste time if it were earned

does it really take a full – to get our tasks done or … do we just push paper masquerading as being productive while we are merely just running down the clock

to kill time  an english phrase that still chills me time can be killed but only by frivolous matters and purposeless activities no one thinks of suicide as a courageous endeavor to kill time

i’ve realized people can live in a world they’ve personally constructed through a distorted lens of guilt and shame whether they deserve it or not

time will tell sweetheart

time is flowing away just like sand in hand

the job of a dream is to set you free

i dont think the human mind can comprehend the past and the future they are both just illusions that can manipulate you into thinking theres some kind of change

if we think a magic fairy named time is finally going to make all things right in the world we’re dreaming

you are what you do so you have to do what you want to be we are how we spend our time

if you want to be super good at texting and watching netflix you should text and watch netflix all day—cause youll get really good at it

if in your dreams you would rather be good at something else then you should spend your time doing that thing dont wait for it to come to you

you are how you spend your time

dream up ways to allow your freedom to not be anchored to a job

in order to minimize regret maximize your respect of time and it’s limitations

time is only one which never stop for anyone

we are swept on by the torrent of things grown so familiar that they cast no shadow we float we float

altogether the task of estimating the lenght of human life is beyond our capacity for directly we say that it is ages long we are reminded that it is briefer than the fall of a rose leaf to the ground

we crave someone to love chase someone to hate and demand someone else decide who receives which fate

if now is said it would instantly be in the past

once now is said its already in the past

make time while you can take time cause time will soon take it all away

be the ‘i’ and ‘i’m’ in time

you cannot continue to hate someone without repeatedly wasting on them some of your precious time and mental energy

when i was young i lived a constant storm

though now and then the brilliant suns shot through

so in my garden few red fruits were born

the rain and thunder had so much to do

the enemy

when the time draws close the buzzing of the bees will be continuous

when i was shooting with collodion i wasn’t just snapping a picture i was fashioning with fetishistic ceremony an object whose ragged black edges gave it the appearance of having been torn from time itself

that doubleheaded monster of damnation and salvation—time

i wish i couldve

done for you what

time has

if you want to be useful dont waste time on that which is useless

you stopped out of fear or the subconscious assumption that you are immortal that there will always be time you promised yourself later

night has fallen and it will last for a very long time

what had old joe hunt answered when i knowingly claimed that history was the lies of the victors as long as you remember that it is also the selfdelusions of the defeated do we remember that enough when it comes to our private lives

she had nothing to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass so swiftly

time has a funny way of helping us come to terms with any event no matter how horrible

they grow up so quickly don’t they when all you really mean is time goes faster for me nowadays

they grow up so quickly don’t they when all you really mean is time goes faster for me nowadays margaret’s

take time to feed your soul and keep the mindbodyspirit connection strong

the strata of time will usually be buried above the foundation of bedrock

if you want to know how valuable you are in life spend your valuable time doing what adds value

yes change can be scary and yes change takes time but with a firm foundation of positive life change in place all possibilities and hopes can turn your life in a positive direction

if you knew how much time you had you would be  following your souls callingand it would definitely manifest

this is time for us memory a nostalgia the pain of absence but it isnt absence that causes sorrow it is affection and love without affection without love such absences would cause us no pain

for this reason even the pain caused by absence is in the end something good and even beautiful because it feeds on that which gives meaning to life

life  time allotted to us

lets not waste it on hatredjealousyanger

not money not skills but time is the biggest lever for massive wealth creation

monotony is the most beautiful or the most atrocious thing the most beautiful if it is a reflection of eternitythe most atrocious if it is the sign of an unvarying perpetuity it is time surpassed or time sterilized

considering the general context of the flow of time it is very disappointing that human life lasts such a short time

live a little or die a lot the choice is hours

getting to know experienced people is the best leisure time you can have

pain indeed makes the time seem to go on very slowly an hour seems like a day and a day like a week

make time to relax you are legally entitled to take a break so what’s stopping you

when the moon is at its best and the sun at its worst you have a hard time finding wheres the nest and wheres the bird

its a small fraction of world population  about  percent  but it seems like plenty to you

you begin to complain about all the people you could be meeting but one one listens or symphathizes with you because this is what you chose when you where alive

you choice to slide down the intelligence ladder is irreversible

sometimes we listen and pay attention to the plot of the dream more often we talk among ourselves and wait for our shift to end

much of your existence took place in the eyes ears and fingertips of others the mirrors are held up in front of you

she why do i feel this deep pain in my heart

he it is natural for a human being to feel the pain of a broken heart

she will i ever come out of this pain

he absolutely yes

she are you sure

he yes be patient time will one fine day mend your broken heart

she why do i feel this deep pain in my heart

he it is natural for a human being to feel the pain of a broken heart

she will i ever come out of this pain

he absolutely yes

she are you sure

he yes be patient one fine day time will mend your broken heart

one must not borrow a long white beard and tie it on

and threaten with the scythe of time the casually curious

time was time will be again

its proved by time  that if you ever add a ego in any relation suddenly that relation will disappear form your life for forever

peter has learned the difficult animal skill of doing nothing hes learned to unshackle himself of the race of time and contemplate time itself  its a lesson hard learned just to sit there and be

but time is a cruel mistress and it was not until much years later that she would learn the truth that there is no such thing as salvation an escape is only ever an illusion conjured up by the hopeful

all these openings for closenessall these humans with their disappointments and their desperate hearts but its so much easier so convenient to blame emotional distance on a lack of time

time tends to pass you by more quickly when you take no notice of it my dear in that its remarkably similar to most women i know

sun benches at the curb bespeak

that having served for shade

served also later for the fire

theres a reason we live in time we are too small a flask  to tolerate too much knowing instead truth must drip through us as through a pipette to allow only moments of apprehension moments diffuse and miniature enough to be survived

if you knew how much time you had you would be  following your souls callingand it would definitely manifest

take a break from the stresses of life and use that time to rediscover the important things that matter to you most we all deserve an antistress day to recharge our batteries

it was not hansu that she missed or even isak what she was seeing again in her dreams was her youth her beginning and her wishesso this is how she became a woman

its just a memory of another time and place memories cant hurt anyone unless they are shared

a true romance is not something that happens between the skins it is something that burns our souls beautifully and leaves us craving to be destroyed even more

to feel that empty again again i listen to my heart wave upon wave salty and red continuing on and on marking time

life is greater than time

trauma is a time traveller an ouroboros that reaches back and devours everything that came before

this thing im doing can hardly be called living instead im lying dormant like a bacterium in a glacier getting time over with thats all

time says let there be

every moment and instantly

there is space and the radiance

of each bright galaxy

and eyes beholding radiance

and the gnats’ flickering dance

and the seas’ expanse

and death and chance

its all about time demand  change so be the demand with change in time

he’d scorned the earth but she kept spinning anyway

i lose the grip of time when i search for its delusional existence

for a long time i have been fascinated by the idea that the world as i experience it only exists in my mind it is the sum of the sensory inputs made real by my brain and experienced by my mind your world is entirely different

time is the essence of words

if you start killing time in the end time will kill you

sometimes i just sit outside of my house in the middle of the night i just sit maybe i’ll even grab a smoke or two before entering again

time sometimes becomes very merciless heartless  it switches off the brightness of the eyes that you once loved

time is always chipping away at our dreams at the moment of death loss becomes complete

rami  why do we have time and times passage

dayah  in this material realm you have been counting and keeping track of the number of turns your beloved little planet takes around its star calling these circulating passages names like days months or years

you have numerically segmented down these days into units such as seconds minutes or hours

and there you have it you have created what you think of as time

but please remember beloved one it is you mortals who created this concept of time and time is much smaller than you are

you are limitless this dear beloved little planet is merely spinning round and round through the infinity of the divine oneness of which you are the microcosm

your heart cannot feel

nothing it cannot heal

if you keep yourself still

steal no time its no real

think twice and cut once

so

cut  ways and think zero times

i dont know how long all of that lasted because time was like rubber it stretched out like a long long elastic rope or a huge piece of chewing gum then it snapped shut into a tiny black square and i passed out

on the forever days in the forever dark eli’s voice had held adrian together

well let time knit these gentle ties between us

malachite eyes sparkled pale green in the light of the setting sun

i think you loved me

and i loved you

but we never really did

at the same time

we do not lack devices for measuring these miserable days of ours in which it should be our pleasure that they be not frittered away without leaving behind any memory of ourselves in the mind of men

i saw all things rosy

oh the thrill the excitement

the newfound energy

and the bounce in my steps

how so easy to make myself believe

that i was in love true love

from where came this jealousy

this anger this bitterness

my loved one is hurting me

i told myself repeatedly

days passed my negativity grew

they need to pay for toying with me

curses to make them realise what they lost

i saw all things black

found solace in quotes about karma

from where came this calm

this blissful indifference

i dont know i dont care

all i want to say is thank you time

time drags time is a monster with a neck bloated with blood

karma’s not a bitch she’s a whore acting like i’ve stolen her pimp

you basically get paid according to the amount of time you invest

time time why worry about something that takes care of itself so well you were born with the habit of consuming time be satisfied with that

the past may not last but it leaves behind endless scars

in the age of social media there is no such thing as just an ordinary human being every time you post in social media you harness the power to speak across time place and race and that makes you extraordinary

he was unrelenting unmerciful and singularly focused nothing stood in his way or hindered his journey until his end itself

i can’t imagine living in a different time estelle said not in the future and certainly not in the past can you

we are not using time time is using us so lets sagely enjoy it before it completely consumes us

school the sum of  years of productivity which have went in state of getting lost

he was a sharpshooter like that bullet straight to the heart

i find that romance is for readers i want adventures they are for the living

abuse could be a slope as slick as ice after a shower of freezing rain

here i built the ruin in

my voice on either side of me

in the temple the ocean could

not be a crowd i mined

the shore with fog the sun dries

these bricks i built the vision in

the cinder block that is the city

wall this grave

tone i speak with a picture

of myself in my wallet

don’t be fooled by grass and these words

because they are real they are

ruinous here the gossip is in the dust

not the sea cloud enters the open

child’s window dimming the silver

flute’s sheen where is he

who hears inside the brick those notes

there is a rumor in the city we’ll exist

if he plays his song no one knows

follow that shadow don’t tell me it’s mine

here there is no being alone

here are my hands which tore the leaves so

quietly in the temple the god

emerging from marble points at the chisel

at the base of his stone did i tell you

where i’m going to the old man

who sings the margin

where on wavetip swords turn edge over edge

wound us and the shore with foam

my face on either side of my face i tore

my picture in half to show the gate

you must climb inside your breath to leave

as fog the wind will bear you—

if you’re lovely—away in the spare clouds

the children’s chorus do you hear—

where were you and where are you going

here i built the ruin in the stonecrushed

sage leaves my hands scented as long ago

when i liked to press the desert against my head to think

despite its ferocious name or perhaps because of it it was the head of the pack of six bars in town the sweet smell of cider and dank cigarette smoke wafted up her nostrils better than lucy’s sweaty armpits at emberswick bar  grill

the language of a river inscribes

over eyes of moths and flies

the navel of the land is a lake

maybe time is like that insect blink said trapped beneath the crystal of your watch

and so anayas story begins with her last thought would i have done this if i had any option but the grave

death can’t be cheated but there are endless ways that life can be lived

you were right barryevery second was a gift

even a broken watch is correct twice a day

she watched him from afar and gave him the time and space to travel the emotional rollercoaster commencing at stunned progressing to upset and lurking at angry then he brooded and grieved for the end of his life as he knew it

regrets it seems are easy to realise when youre dying

stop thinking in the box its time to think out of the box

but what if after one small change her life would become much worse than it was or unthinkable disasters result from a single step off her path

the years passed and with her days nothing was expensive

silvery is the mirror of time

if you look at it with mind unruffled

each experience made you stronger

each defeat made you enamelled

but night falls again

but night falls again

the apprentice gave him a bleary look it was too early in the morning for it to be early int he morning that was hte only thing that he currently knew for sure

erwhat does master want for breakfast he said

wen looked down from their camp and across the snowfields and purple mountains to the golden daylight creating the world and mused upon certain aspects of humanity

ah he said one of the difficult ones

the words and phrases had so much more gravitas in her adult mind she felt a sharp pang of guilt as she realized the extent of what she hadn’t been aware of and how little compassion she’d had as an actual teen

the day she was going to tell her aunts about the boy she had met

her regularly squared and frenchtipped nails were dangerously chipped and jagged and she touched her platinum hair so often that it had started to look like the kinked bristles of an overused toothbrush

the stainedglass window on the front door shatters into tiny pieces behind her as it slams shut when he gets to it at last it sounds like a musical cadence heightening some eerie psycho movie score

and then they came upon it it was painted in the most catretch shade of beige you ever beheld

anaya inhaled the rich scent of soil along with the sharp citric smell of thriving vegetation and the sweetness of fresh dew her eyes drifted shut and she pricked up her ears the gushing sound of the nearby waterfalls enveloping her

abstract white cirrus clouds streaked across the sky the cool breeze rustled the leaves in the trees and disturbed the ones settled on the ground anaya couldn’t help but see a metaphor in that

i once took all my journals

from  years and burned them

watching the past disintegrate

reminded me of life and time the present

is all i had time slowly burning

away each moment

if you could go back in time and redo one thing in your life what would it be

when they invented the car they invented the collision and the darkness of what time leads the willing body to do

parent time is magic downtempo and supersonic all at once witch’s time sorcerer hours suddenly while you aren’t paying attention everything’s changed

planning ahead can be tough but start with a daily work planthen you move to weeklymonthly and boom yearly get organized have ordermoney likes order

we’re meant for each other for a moment but no one knows how long the moment lasts except the moment itself

eternity is awful long time especially towards the end

nobody knows better than a portrait artist that time marks us it nicks us up and leaves us looking used like a welltraveled suitcase or a favourite book

the moment is an inch long and a mile deep

i told you i loved you but i said it a little too late you move in time and sometimes our timing is against one another

time stands still when purpose and passion are the present

let not time deceive you

you cannot conquer time

the longer you live the harder it becomes to grab them each little moment as it arrives to be living in something other than the past or the future to be actually here

when its write time its the right time

you get to a point where even the bad time flies

start early to reach on time because deciding to start just on time will be late starting just on time will only guarantee some desperate efforts but not the expected results make sure your timing leaves you with some time inhand to try again

eternity takes forever the infinite expanse of time just does not know when to quit

my phone’s dead and i have to find the microwave to read the time  only bad news comes this early

everyone measures time some in moments some in years and some in centuries but it is a part of life

intuition is the organ that senses when eternity breaks into time – when gold shines through the mud

but the movement of time seemed not to be fixed properly the bloody weight of desire and the rusty anchor of remorse were blocking its normal flow time was not an arrow flying in a straight line

you die in time to realize somethings aren’t worthwhile

clocks will always have different sized hands but not feet

let me say goodbye again

a minute more

a chance to see

the distinction between the past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion

your dreams are never lost they are merely waiting for your attention passion and action to return to them

sitting here i glance over my right shoulder at the little row of books red and green and blue which stand waiting for my hand offering their accumulated riches i think of the years that may be in store for me and of all the pages i may turn

i suppose you could say these images present a glimpse of the world around me during the last  years as well as moments in time for the creatures and nature sharing the same space as me

wheels will always turn full circle

times up for modern society

it had already passed an hour and he knew it without even needing to check a watch although he did not have one

a student does not need her school or university she never needed one teacher

he would have liked spending a little time with one of the girls himself instead he had to settle for sleeping in a room with a bunch of guys it was a total sausage fest he thought

all events and people you have cherished in the past and all events and people that are yet to happen to you exist at all times this for sure beats the traditional concept of heaven

palmira she’s like an apparition floating unknowingly into her future i said here for too brief a time

give its time to its time too time to time

passages in time shall leave timeless evidence in their wake

only a master changed an old structure faster than half a second

indeed men who manage to defeat time by anxiously safeguarding their tomorrow by not allowing it to stray anywhere from the past have in effect conquered death itself

the fate of everything we see is hidden in time only when the time moves we shall see what fate the things we see have

in former times i watched the time of times now in my early ages i love to protect my destiny my testimony and my great reward

memories are aches they are the laughter

smiles of time flee to seize the hereafter

you remembered she said surprised that this thing called time had happened to us after all

we are the ghost of the choices we didnt make and shredded skin of the ones we did

i have a feeling we’re going to have a lot of time to read in the next few days or weeks she thought about it and said jesus how long do you think things will go on like this

history was is a oneway street you have to keep walking forwards but you dont always need to look ahead sometimes you can just look around and be happy right where you are

she was his favorite sin she was not a habit for him anymore she was an obsession

its easy to write history all the eyewitnesses are dead

ben hanscom feels the wall of time grow suddenly thin some terriblewonderful peristalsis has begun to take place he thinks my god i am being digested by my own past

so many authors so little time to disqualify them

time is not meant to be spent it is meant to be experienced

i limp along through my mourning

time did indeed heal all wounds but it left a nasty unforgiving scar

money is a replaceable resource when youre out of it you can earn it back you cant say the same for time dont spend too much time thinking about money

don’t wait for someone to come along and change your life only you have the ability to change yourself

you can become talented at anything if you are willing to put in the time and effort if you want results you must put in the effort

the distance of time’s separation brings us remnants of memories so ancient that most are lost in the mists of illusion…

you should understand the value of time and use it accordingly in a constructive manner so that you can be blessed with time

laugh i tell you

and you will turn back

the hands of time

smile i tell you

and you will reflect

the face of the divine

sing i tell you

and all the angels will sing with you

cry i tell you

and the reflections found in your pool of tears

will remind you of the lessons of today and yesterday

to guide you through the fears of tomorrow

love is a powerful thing it transcends time and place if youre looking for immortality love long and love well the rest will take care of itself

everything in this world changes according to time

i don’t like to spend money i like to spend time

within was given i gave the best i ever could

time never waits for you so reach before to ring it

he fed himself to the demons he had inside him every single day just to save her from being consumed by them

let time be a motivator to start living your dreams now

you are not made from your past you simply exist in this time and only this time enjoy the moment experience

time is communal marya morevna the most purely communal of all commodities it belongs to us all equally

i remember when youll be a month old and ill stumble out of bed to give you your  am feeding

three things have a limited threshold

time pain and death

while truth love and knowledge

are boundless

three things are needed

for humanity to coexist

truth peace and basic needs

you should use every moment of your life properly and meaningfully without wasting time

even such is time that takes in trust

our youth our joys our all we have

and pays us but with earth and dust

who in the dark and silent grave

when we have wandered all our ways

shuts up the story of our days

but from this earth this grave this dust

my god shall raise me up i trust

even such is time from petition to anne of denmark

time is more than money and other precious things in the universe

stop thinking that you have got another day to do what you should do today because you may not

the more you add value to yourself the more you discover that you could be much more creative than you are

there is nothing that anyone can do to increase or reduce time

there is so much about yourself that you are yet to discover

the more you add value to yourself the more you discover that you could be better than you are

the more you add value to yourself the more you discover that you could be greater than you are

work is the first step out of a life of mediocrity and irrelevance

time is not something you give back the very next moment may be an answer to your prayer to deny that is to deny the most important part of the future

what’s that

when you are measuring life you are not living it

you need to understand that for you time is not forever

a time will come when either by reason of frailty or death you will not be able to do the things that you can do now

apply yourself to maximizing each day now that you can

when you work it reveals your gifts it helps to discover your potentials

time unlike all other assets that a person freely possesses a truly limited resource

there is more to discover about you

time is a person’s most inflexible asset

time is an asset that is automatically consumed

three things you cannot recover in life the word after its said the moment after its missed and the time after its gone be careful

the only way to redeem your time is to effectively engage in the conversation of every second every minute every hour and every day

go ahead and reign in life by converting your time into concrete values product and services

time runs only in the forward direction and it can never be regained

if we destroy our time time also destroys us very badly

time only gives one chance if you lose it once you can never get it back

time has no beginning or ending

time has no limitation and boundary and it moves continuously at its own pace

time never stops for anybody and never shows kindness to anyone

once time is lost it can never be earned by any means

when you work you exercise your mental potentials

the reason why god cannot stop the working is because through work he unveils himself

work is a blessing and makes us a blessing to others

a goal completed is a goal completed regardless of the time it takes to complete do not focus on the time it will take to complete your goals but rather focus on how to complete your goal

when you work you discover yourself

when god created time he also created work as an instrument to convert that time into concrete and physical wealth

there is a huge difference between work and job

apart from time work it one of the greatest gift god gave to mankind

work gives god the possibility and opportunity to unveil himself in a new dimension each time he works

every time god works he is revealing himself

work allows god to renew himself

work unveils a new layer it unveils a new dimension of god you’ve never experienced before

we should be motivated to give our best

work allows you to discover a new you every time

work is one of god’s instruments for you to discover yourself

work is the thing that should get you excited the most in life

work is a medium through which you will discover the depth of wealth that god has planted in you

it is only through work that you will discover that there is a seed of greatness in you

it is only through work that you will discover that you are not ordinary

it is only through work that you will discover that you are not ordinary

excellence is meant to be our motivation and attitude toward work

it is only through work that you will know that you are greater than what you see

it is only through work that you can effectively maximize the wealth of time

work reveals our creative ability

work makes us a cocreator with god

work increases and improves your skills and abilities

work is meant to allow us exercise dominion over all the gods creation

work gives us money to pay for our basic needs

work gives us dignity and respect
