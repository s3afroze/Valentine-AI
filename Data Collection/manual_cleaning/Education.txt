the person must utilize adequate quantitative andor qualitative reasoning in order to solve both ill and well defined problems for his or her assigned tasks

one of the most important parts of education is learning to get along with other people

there is no merit in being born in a country where there is a developed educational system or a favorable environment

to know – thats true happiness

yes’ i say ‘it’s my first actual day of high school ever i moved from the country i was homeschooled via distance ed before now’

‘incredible’ he shakes my free hand while lying in that peculiar position ‘you’ve managed to evade formal education for a signifcant period of your life congratulations and well done’

‘are you taking the piss’

‘good god no

there is no knowledge like kindness

one of the problems with having time to read all that you want is that your interests become so eclectic its hard to focus

i am completely uneducated not going to university did give me an incredible driving force because it leaves you with a slight chip on your shoulder it makes me feel i am going to read absolutely everything so i can prove i am not stupid

you are the answer that the world has been waiting for in education sector

don’t delay god’s agenda to deliver quality education to your sphere of influence

don’t be the reason why the educational system is still crawling because you don’t believe you are good enough to add value to the educational system

our world needs more white flags – in relationships friendships political agendas and education – because we are now endorsed with countless capacities to spot red flags but too often we forget about reconciliation

thinking calls for facts facts are found by digging but he who has gathered this wealth is well equipped for life

normal is a concept formed by averages but it changes with education and tolerance

books were my church but even more my native land my place of refuge my dp camp i was an exile early on but exile welcomed me it was were i belonged

learn about yourself then teach others to learn about their true self let them see the wonders of the world in there true colors

civilization as well as education takes a downward spiral when it ceases to ask what is truth and concerns itself primarily with what is measurable

in india there are thousands of girls who kill their true loves just because of their family respect but we still don’t value their feelings dreams and emotions

it is difficult to learn anything worthwhile if you only listen to those who share your views

education is the resistance to everything that is bad today

i am very sorry but i am infinitely more intelligent than these three professors and i therefore refuse to be examined by them i know more about raphael than all of you altogether

now when i read constantly about the way in which library funds are being cut and cut i can only think that the door is closing and that american society has found one more way to destroy itself

roll the paper stick and shape it after that roll another paper strip stick and shape it do that again and again these are three simple steps which define the technique named quilling

real education is the key to change anything your desire

educated beyond the point considered wise for females

a particular concept would not exist in everyday communication from a persons perspective if he or she does not know how to represent his or her theory with valid meaning and reasoning

you have to have the fight to win to win the fight  g swiss

though i have lived most of my life with

educationalists i have little interest in educa¬

tion i dislike schools both for boys and

girls a child between the ages of eight and

eighteen the normal school years is too young

to form a collective opinion children only

set up foolish savage taboos i dislike also

all plans for developing a child’s mind

and all conscious forms of personal influence

of the younger by the elder let children

let them browse freely in a good library see

all they can of the firstrate in nature art

and literature—above all give them a chance

of knowing what science and scientific method

means and then leave them to sink or swim

above all things do not cultivate in them a

you teach them very litter

why should we it only leads to trouble and discontent we amuse them

if we take pride of our responsibility completing tasks it will create an good impression among others about our commitment to fulfill their needs andor wants

when a person opens his or her mouth the dialogue must contain a purpose that sounds sensible towards his or her surroundings if the person uses this strategy he or she can earn self respect from others

high self respect is a characteristic that we earn from our environment by showing courtesy and naturally exhibiting behaviors that can praise others about the output of our intellectual accomplishments instead of chasing them for attention

your love can be stolen away from you but knowledge is eternal

send your child to school for education not for attendance

whatever happens to us was a useful education

serious students are always serious and it is not as if they just want to be serious but because they want to achieve something distinctive with their seriousness

reason restrains but imagination evolve

i was an ordinary person who studied hard there are no miracle people it happens they get interested in this thing and they learn all this stuff but they’re just people

know what you’re working toward and eliminate debt so that if you change your mind later it doesn’t kill you to know you have a hundred thousand dollar biology degree hanging in the kitchen of the tapas restaurant you just opened

how many of us have read history and shook our heads and puffed our chest and said if i were alive during that period i would never have done those things to those people yet here we are doing those things to those people

there is no direct relationship between iq and economic opportunity in the supposed interests of fairness and social justice the natural relationship has been all but obliterated

sorry folks but this is not your grandfather’s meritocracy any more

i’m sure if socrates were alive today and had to sit through even a single meeting discussing how to use data to inform instruction he’d kill himself all over again

i am here to help her learn tansy said not to keep her from it

going to school is rarely a choice at all but rather just the thing you do because everyone else does it

to teachers education is just a duty but to students its their right

the proper concern of a primary school is not education in a narrow sense and still less preparation for later life but the present lives of the children

a dreamer with high self esteem would start his or her life aiming for high ambitions and end his or her life with successful accomplishments that can remain as a legacy forever

if students merely recite academic concepts from books and their instructors verbal lectures it will not help them to clearly understand course material contents because there was no application of critical thinking strategies

education is the most powerful weapon

self learners kindled their own fire

well we cant teach em better pass em

let those eradicate who can

mans inhumanity to man

through teaching boys to kiss the flag

keep their rooms tidy kick a fag

follow the leader mind the rules

blunt and ignore the only tools

that interest the halfmature

its not in the will to prove an idea to be true but in the utmost desire to disprove it that the absolute truth emerges

being lawful and following the rules means allowing their reality to become your reality and their reality includes you pledging your allegiance to their republic before you’re old enough know what the words allegiance or republic mean

school exams are memory tests in realworld no one is going to stop you from referring a book to solve a problem

the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is the very root of judgment character and will  an education which should improve this faculty would be the education par excellence

the aim of education is the condition of suspended judgment on everything

a fool will always rely on what someone else says however an intelligent person would use critical thinking to justify the rationality of statements made by others before embracing their influence

by some need to appear intellectual nonthinkers will instantly and without question subscribe to the opinions of those they feel other people think are educated

work hard you can be millionaire

work hard and smart you can be billionaire

get ready to beat capitalism in its own game

create war among countries be merciless and cruel

but there is a problem  trillionaire doesnt know what happens after death

but if we get education right it would acknowledge that the path to true learning begins nowhere else but in delight and the words on the signpost say once upon a time …  isis lecture

learning how to be at peace with oneself and others that would be a real education

we mathematicians understand that without the education of children the economy cannot grow and the world would starve from ignorance

how could you be alone when you can find company in reading books

i think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have whether it’s on booze or women or movies

i have seen the waitress working the overnight shift at a diner to give her children a better life  yes maybe even take them to a movie once in awhile  and in her i see america

i have seen the public school teachers spending extra time with students who need help  who get no extra pay for their efforts  in them i see america

i have seen parents sitting around kitchen tables with stacks of pressing bills  wondering if they can afford a christmas gift for their children  in them i see america

i have seen the young diplomat in a distant foreign capital  the young soldier in a battlefield foxhole  in them i see america

i have seen the brilliant graduates of the best law schools who forgo the riches of a corporate firm for the often thankless slog of a district attorney or public defenders office  in them i see america

i have seen the librarian reshelving books the firefighter police officer  paramedic in service in trying times the social worker helping the elderly  infirm the youth sports coaches the pta presidents  in them i see america

i have seen the immigrants working a cash register at a gas station or trimming hedges in the frost of an early fall morning or driving a cab through rush hour traffic to make better lives for their families  in them i see america

i have seen the science students unlocking the mysteries of life late at night in university laboratories for little or no pay  in them i see america

i have seen the families struggling with a cancer diagnosis or dementia in a parent or spouse amid the struggles of mortality  dignity in them i see america

when your underwear costs more than your childs education then you are in serious trouble

to sustain the value of education students should be respected as much as the teachers

the industrialized mass nature of school goes back to the very beginning to the common

school and the normal school and the idea of universal schooling all of which were invented at

precisely the same time we were perfecting mass production and interchangeable parts and then

the common school now called a public school was a brand new concept created shortly after

the civil war common because it was for everyone for the kids of the farmer the kids of

the potter and the kids of the local shopkeeper horace mann is generally regarded as the

father of the institution but he didn’t have to fight nearly as hard as you would imagine—

because industrialists were on his side the two biggest challenges of a newly industrial

economy were finding enough compliant workers and finding enough eager customers the

common school solved both problems

the normal school now called a teacher’s college was developed to indoctrinate teachers into

the system of the common school ensuring that there would be a coherent approach to the

processing of students if this sounds parallel to the notion of factories producing items in bulk

of interchangeable parts of the notion of measurement and quality it’s not an accident

the world has changed of course it has changed into a culture fueled by a market that knows

how to masscustomize to find the edges and the weird and to cater to what the individual

mass customization of school isn’t easy do we have any choice though if mass production

and mass markets are falling apart we really don’t have the right to insist that the schools we

designed for a different era will function well now

respect for all reward for the worthy reservation for none

universities are reluctant to update their syllabus as per industry requirement not because their students will have to take the trouble to learn new things but because their professors will have to take the trouble to teach new things

to delight in literature is to desire to learn

the more i read the more i fought against the assumption that literature is for the minority  of a particular education or class books were my birthright too

in a country like nigeria people have been made to believe that you need prayer to do what god has given men power to achieve

one of the more difficult questions i used to find myself being asked as a united nations official especially when i had been addressing a generalist audience was what is the single most important thing that can be done to improve the world

if i had to pick one thing we must do above all else i now offer a twoword mantra educate girls

when education is free and available instantaneously innovation comes from valuable transformational relationships not transactions

i asked what we must do about intolerance and fanaticism which was flaring all around the world education and wider contacts are really the only solutions the dalai lama replied

pure anecdotal statements would not convince others about the actual societal problems and solutions without providing reliable empirical evidence

when the racism involves in education the learning outcome will be like the torch without light

the poorly sophisticated since many of us are as presumed to be lacking in good arguments we are then prone to being wellversed in insults

whoever desire to learn shall delight to listen

wisdom accumulates in the cracks of personal experience and the crevices of bad judgments

the universal mission of all educators is to let the torch of knowledge illuminate the world

stupidity arise for unwillingness to study

all the gifts which fortune bestows she can easily take away but education when combined with intelligence never fails but abides steadily on to the very end of life

gracious spirit kindled the fire to search for the sacred knowledge

in this life one of the greatest lessons ive learned is that i still have a lot to learn

we must learn as long as we live

do you ever hear a study can strengthen you against the violence get enrollment the course at academy for social emotional learning school sel learn the online and offline courses to reduce the physical violence in new jersey

sacred knowledge is the spirit of kindness

practical experience can coney a persons actual fundemental understanding of a specific idea with the inclusion of supporting  reliable evidence rather than only using his or her pure ancedotal beliefs

you have to teach yourself to be free they dont teach that in school

there is no such thing as primitive in the way western education has traditionally conditioned people to perceive it

a job should be given to those who deserve it not those who demand it

a man without regrets cannot be cured

experience is the teacher of true education

to get a true education going to school is not enough school helps students gain knowledge however true education is in gaining wisdom which can only be earned with experience

religion culture education are all things that sound wonderful in theory in practice however they are not so wonderful

wonder begets culture which begets yet more wonder and the end of wonder is wisdom which is the state of perpetual wonder

i dont have anything to give you except to show you a way to better yourself

the educational policy he considers the most important isnt what river you live in but how you swim in the river you live in

understanding also comes in different ways according to beliefs and misbeliefs

if you are open to life’s lessons and do not feed on beliefs and prejudices you are like a blank sheet of paper on which god writes his messages to you in holy ink

a man can be rich as long as he reads

consciousness is reflected in the word like the sun in a drop of water

lev vygotskythought and language

the real plague is willful ignorance and education cant cure that

ah heavens and earth friend if you had made the acquiring of ignorance the study of your life you could not have graduated with higher honor than you could today

the teacher is of course an artist but being an artist does not mean that he or she can make the profile can shape the students what an educator does in teaching is to make it possible for the students to become themselves

learning empowering studying practicing and not repeating the same mistakes will help you move forward move up and move on to where you want to be

if you don’t know your tendencies and can’t analyze when you are most effective then how can you get the most done in the least amount of time with the best results

when the true history fades ask education and the unbiased story tellers

it’s quite possible that mortality is simply the result of poor education

if we do not fix education in africa we are heading for monumental economic disaster

learning is the process of making ideas while studying is the process of using those ideas

experience is a sacred education

if you stop learning you forget what you ready know

your education is your life

you can only write well what you have experienced

a primitive education can only create primitive generations an outdated mentality will produce merely an outdated minds the door of the future is closed for such archaic residuals from the premodern time of social evolution

the question must be asked have we been the beneficiaries or the victims of our education

step into the light and create your own shadow

knowledge is just a foundation the whole point of a foundation is to build on it

everyone is pretty good at learning very few are good at doing

when she asked george what way she could best apply it for him he answered give me an education emily that has always been my hearts desire then i can do all the rest

based on the physiological researches there is a connection between self confidence and the person’s professional efficiency and his ability to fix his mistakes and failures

and pedagogical studies suggest to teachers to deal with their students as partners in the educational process and not only as the part targeted to be educated

like playing cards in the hands of an unprofessional player the school activities papers are scattered lacking the connection between them and the upper educational goals

let your only graduation be in the grave

the trouble with being educated is that it takes a long time it uses up the better part of your life and when you are finished what you know is that you would have benefited more by going into banking

how could you renew your mind if you never read

i always returned from my travels with new books

without failure there is no success

what you read renew your mind

you can learn to write by writing

every great endeavour is fueled by great enthusiasm

ignorance is the deepest sin of dark doom

if education is the key then the teacher is the hand that holds the key how can the key alone open a door we must always care for teachers

education leans on teaching teaching cannot be without the teacher

death has been said to be the leveller in that it does not recognize one’s class race

ethnicity or nationality death does not look at the face before it strikes it pays no

attention to one’s beliefs or outlook to issues in life death has often been said to be

inevitable so it is glaring that for as long as people are born people are bound to die

someday but how man dies is a huge mystery

i always return from my travels with new books

the establishment of a universal system of public education inevitably changed the relations of education to the state

the more widely we extend the range of education the more necessary it is to provide some principle of cohesion to counterbalance the centrifugal tendencies of specialization and utilitarianism

education has always meant the initiation of the young into the social and spiritual inheritance of the community in other words education has meant the transmission of culture

imagination is a sacred intuition

nothing gets easy it is just that you understand how it is and how it works nothing its difficult its just that you dont understand it and dont know how it works understanding something it means taking time to learn it and practising it

imagination is the sacred intuition

catholic education and law schools provide me with a lot of miserable people as psychotherapy clients i should be grateful these people are looking for rescue from their education

if you want to be an educated person follow nobody but learn from everybody

never justify someones wrong action without them apologizing first  admitting their wrongs if you do you are not making them better but you are making them worse on the bad things they do

not everyone in school is learning not everyone learning is in school

in this day and age nobody can learn more than a sliver of all there is to know why force everyone to learn the same sliver

man rejection of the truth is the root of his rebellion

education is a means not an end we dont enroll in formal education ad nauseam as a way of escaping life rather we educate ourselves in order to become equipped to respond wisely to gods calling

experience is the only subject worthwhile of study

the greatest knowledge is the knowledge of god

the truest knowledge is the fear of god

suddenly i was plunged back into an avid learning environment starting at the bottom and working my way painstakingly up the mountain the thrill of learning and accomplishing stimulated me so much that the work was pleasurable

i do not consider my deeds or my knowledge to be a great thing the only fact is — and i can say this honestly — that i love learning and a solitary life

in chaos is where learning happens the most

knowledge perpetuates luck and luck perpetuates knowledge

the only good knowledge is the knowledge of god

solution to every long term problem is education

solution to every short term problem is a smile

you can only learn to read by reading

children are no longer being parented but are raised thats why they dont have morals ethicshumanity and manners because their parents neglected them we now live in a

society that doesnt care about right or wrong

we awaken by asking the right questions

when people support you when you have done something wrong it doesnt mean you are right but it means those people are promoting their hate  bad behavior or living their bad lives through you

among other possibilities money was invented to make it possible for a foolish man to control wise men a weak man strong men a child old men an ignorant man knowledgeable men and for a dwarf to control giants

you are just

you are not just for the right or left

but for what is right over the wrong

you are not just rich or poor

but always wealthy in the mind and heart

you are not perfect but flawed

you are flawed but you are just

you may just be conscious human

but you are also a magnificent

it is impossible for an uneducated man to rebel

i dont celebrate any friendship that was build on hate because we share the common enemy

education is the realization of hope for the future

the greatest innovators and history makers of our world were not great because of the formal school system but because of selfdevelopment through the proper investment and conversation of time

another distraction that deviates people from their god given purpose and calling is the distraction of job and formal education

but if im useless only because i havent been properly educated is that my fault

we do many things carelessly or unwillingly but nothing studiously unless we are willing and apply ourselves

there is only one holy knowledge the excellent knowledge of god

if you have influence on other people dont be influenced by their hate money jealousy anger and popularity

one act of a kind deed is better than thousand words of knowledge

what matter most is to complete the journey

daily reading is vital for own self development

let us reason according to the scriptures

there is far far more to being human than any of us can become on our own

the real certificate is to know jesus christ

all thought is a feat of association

if you dont read books and if you dont get consumed by the physical and moral life of men and women in fiction and history too many facets of yourself may never come into being

a student should not be taught more than he can think about

a library is treasure chamber of knowledge

the act of reading is skill that can be cultivated

if there is knowledge we shall seek we must search for the excellent knowledge of christ jesus

whoever holds the keys to house of knowledge must open the door for those who search for light of knowledge to enter

the key to knowledge is the kingdom of god

what i must know only the master teaches

a library is chamber of treasures

the joy of reading is grace of renewal of mind

the real education never ends

education is a cycle of reading thinking and writing

the wisdom of god is what we ought to seek

a person who has clean ears can act and communicate with people more maturely than others who use their big mouth all the time because he or she can thouroughly understand other peoples perspectives unlike people with big mouths

my education taught me a lot but nothing i needed to learn

every now and then im lucky enough to teach a kindergarten or firstgrade class many of these children are naturalborn scientists

speaking is like conducting an orchestra but instead of music you are directing emotions

in large states public education will always be extremely mediocre for the same reason that in large kitchens the cooking is at best only mediocre

an uncorked kid to me is an expression as to who they truly are and isnt it that that as adults we strive to achieve throughout our whole lives

it is better to be kind than to seek much knowledge

real education doesnt make your life easy it complicates things and makes everything messy and disturbing but the alternative elloren gardner is to live your life based on injustice and lies

let them learn at school whatever they learn to pass the examinations but at home let the education that you provide be the kind that widens their perceptions and takes away the germs of prejudices that infect them while they are out in the world

higher educationi wonder how much longer the deception can go on

always choose the most difficult way there you will not meet competitors

but as we all know rock ‘n’ roll will never die and education too as henry adams always sez keeps going on forever

i finally understood that i didn’t lack pen and paper but my own

memorizing mind it had been given away with a hundred poems called

rote learning oldfashioned backward an enemy of creative thinking

education attainment is a kind of achievement that nobody can seize from us as the assets we own in our regular lives because we earned it with the use of our own knowledge and creativity

over a hundred german scientists arrived here huntsville at eleven o’clock on an april morning and by nightfall more than sixty had applied for cards at the free library

proper education is the key for us to posses strong civic values refined knowledge and career readiness

creativity is a unique characteristics that a person can posses from his or her own knowledge when he or she is creating changes in society that can benefit a vast amount of people

training is a necessary tool

a child today an adult tomorrow

what is worth to knowcan only be experienced

what is essence of knowledge if it does not change the way we act

the knowledge of god is a sacred pursuit

the god is our greatest teacher

a person is a scholar as long as he seeks knowledge once he thinks he knows only then he becomes an ignorant

ignorance is the root of many ills knowledge must be the fundamental ally of nations that aspire despite all their tragedies and problems to become truly emancipated to build a better world

for the sole true end of education is simply this to teach men how to learn for themselves and whatever instruction fails to do this is effort spent in vain

true the school admin decided that a girls clothes were more important than her education

what we ought to know we never be taught in the classroom

to learn we must first listen

real education is never acquisition of knowledge but training of character

my mother watched and learned getting good at the ways of this new world she dressed beautifully our quarters were always handsomely fitted out she and dad were gracious wellspoken

they were far from rich but there were books and there was music and sometimes conversations about the world we even listened to the metropolitan opera broadcasts on saturdays

the world of books is the only paradise there is

too much study depletes the soul of its strength

history is the hallmark of humanity

meditation is the energy of the mind

we as ambitious human beings can maintain self respect by influencing ourselves to behave as civil human beings and focus on our long term goals by not allowing others to take advantage of our lives

you must do much work to fulfill your dream

the real education is the reality of how well you live life

we must cultivate our heads but nurture our hearts

life is education it only end in death

the one thing no one can ever take from you is your education…

you can only write well what you have lived

god is the greatest teacher of all times

life is always just to learn

history displays the events of time

when you feel confident to take huge risks in life and consistently learn from your mistakes you will eventually pursue your educational financial relationship or physical fitness goals successfully

doctors of ancient times used to recommend reading to their patients as a physical exercise on an equal level as walking running or ballplaying

a woman today who has no goal no purpose no ambition patterning her days into the future making her stretch and grow beyond that small score of years in which her body can fill its biological function is committing a kind of suicide

what shapes the best in us dies when the best education dies the best in us shall always be undermined when they that are responsible for shaping the best in us are always undermined

i stand for a different education a different education where students will not just learn books but life

i stand for a different education a different education where students will not just learn moral principles but they shall be living examples of moral principles

womans sexual problems are in this sense byproducts of the suppression of her basic need to grow and fulfill her potentialities as a human being potentialities which the mystique of feminine fulfillment ignores

you cannot know what i do not tell you yet you will be judged harshly for not knowing

but for someone who wants to be an artist a creator an architect of an original vision the best book to read on screenwriting is no book on screenwriting the best seminar is no seminar at all

the truth is you don’t

if you love and want to make movies about issues of social import get your hands on paddy chayefsky’s screenplay for network read it then watch the movie then read it again

if you love and want to make big blockbusters that also have great artistic merit do the same thing with lawrence kasdan’s raiders of the lost ark screenplay and the movie made from it

most people who were educated have become the problems instead of problem solvers

make your education valuable apply what you learnt refuse to take the back seat and watch things happen join the change and be part of the change

education is a system designed to make you feel inferior yet they encourage you to accept it in order to be superior

education is not merely meant for you to write and pass exams get a good job and a good spouse and settle down for survival

what shapes the best in us dies when the best education dies the best in us shall always be undermined when they that are responsible for shaping the best in us are always undermined

to do nothing is always easy ferbin did not try to keep the bitterness out of his voice

to do nothing when you are so tempted to do something and entirely have the means to do so is harder it grows easier only when you know you do nothing for the active betterment of others

effect of a true teacher goes up to eternity through his students

ah well it stands for freedom from morality we dont think healthy amorality happens naturally

there shall be confusion also in many places and the fire shall be oft sent out again and the wild beasts shall change their places and menstruate women shall bring forth monsters

salt waters shall be found in the sweet and all friends shall destroy one another then shall wit hide itself and understanding withdraw itself into his secret chamber

one land also shall ask another and say ‘is righteousness that makes a man righteous gone through thee’ and it shall say ‘no

at the same time shall men hope but nothing obtain they shall labor but their ways shall not prosper

to shew thee such tokens i have leave and if thou wilt pray again and weep as now and fast even days thou shall hear yet greater things

an extreme fearfulness moves through all your body and your mind is troubled more

after seven days of fasten so it was that the thoughts of my heart were very grievous unto me and my soul recovered the spirit of understanding

hear me and i will instruct thee hearken to the thing that i say and i shall tell thee more

thou art sore troubled in mind for the people in the world’s sake loves thou that people better than he that made them

o lord that bear rule who may know these things but he that had not his dwelling with men

as for you youre unwise how may you then speak of these things whereof thou ask you

he shall rule whom they look not for that dwell upon the earth and the fowls shall take their flight away together

rules are rules was stuffed into him from the crib like he was a thanksgiving turkey

i will liken my judgment unto a ring like as there is no slackness of the last even so there is no swiftness of the first

could thou not make those that have been made and be now and that are for to come at once that thou might shew thy judgement the sooner

the creature may not haste above the maker neither may the world hold them at once that shall be created therein

thou hast given a right judgment but why judge thou not thyself also

i beseech thee o lord let me have understanding for it was not my mind to be curious of the high things but of such as pass by us daily

wherefore the present age is given up as a reproach to the heathen and for what cause the people whom thou hast loved is given over unto ungodly nations

why the law of our forefathers are brought to nought and the written covenants come to none effect

we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers and our life is astonishment and fear and we are not worthy to obtain mercy

what will he then do unto his name whereby we are called of these things have i asked

i went into a forest into a plain and the trees took counsel and said come let us go and make war against the sea that it may depart away before us and that we may make us more woods

the floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel and said come let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain that there also we may make us another country

the thought of the wood was in vain for the fire came and consumed it

the thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought for the sand stood up and stopped them

if thou wart judge now betwixt these two whom would thou begin to justify or whom would thou condemn

the more thou search the more thou shall marvel for the world hast fast to pass away

the world hast fast to pass away and cannot comprehend the things that are promised to the righteous in time to come for this world is full of unrighteousness and infirmities

do not thou hasten above the most highest for thy haste is in vain to be above him for thou hast much exceeded

did not the souls also of the righteous ask question of these things in their chambers saying how long shall i hope on this fashion when cometh the fruit of the floor of our reward

o lord that bear rule even we all are full of impiety and for our sakes peradventure it is that the floors of the righteous are not filled because of the sins of them that dwell upon the earth

go thy way to a woman with child and ask of her when she had fulfilled her nine months if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her

in the grave the chambers of souls are like the womb of a woman for like as a woman that travails make haste to escape the necessity of the travail even so do these places haste to deliver those things that are committed unto them

from the beginning look what thou desires to see it shall be shew thee

if i have found favor in thy sight and if it be possible and if i be meet therefore shew me then whether there be more to come than is past or more past than is to come

stand up upon the right side and i shall expound the similitude unto thee

consider with thyself as the rain is more than the drops and as the fire is greater than the smoke but the drops and the smoke remain behind so the quantity which is past did more exceed

as for the tokens whereof thou ask me i may tell thee of them in part but as touching thy life i am not sent to shew thee

iniquity shall be increased above that which now thou see or that thou hast heard long ago

the land that thou see now to have root shall thou see wasted suddenly

if the most high grant thee to live thou shall see after the third trumpet that the sun shall suddenly shine again in the night and the moon thrice in the day

it were better that we were not at all than that we should live still in wickedness and to suffer and not to know wherefore

what man is able to do that that thou should ask such things of me

the poor man whom the law does not allow to take an ear of corn when starving nor a pair of shoes for his freezing feet is allowed to put his hand into the pocket of the rich and say you shall educate me not as you will but as i will

nevertheless now have i asked thee but only of the fire and wind and of the day wherethrough thou hast passed and of things from which thou canst not be separated and yet canst thou give me no answer of them

in the end you will realize most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly

the greatest futility says the congregator the greatest futility everything is futile what does a person gain from all his hard work at which he toils under the sun a generation goes and another cometh forth but the earth remains the same

go thy way weigh me the weight of the fire or measure me the blast of the wind or call me again the day that is past

in the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold not thine hand for thou know not whether shall prosper either this or that or whether they both shall be alike good

truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun but if a man live many years and rejoice in them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be many and all that cometh is vanity

these be they that have put off the mortal clothing and put on the immortal and have confessed the name of god now are they crowned and receive palms

go thy way and tell my people the people of thy lord god what manner of things and how great wonders of the lord thy god thou hast seen

and yet their reward appear not and their labor had no fruit for i have gone here and there through the heathen and i see that they flow in wealth and think not upon thy commandments

weigh thou therefore their wickedness now in the balance and theirs also that dwell the world and so shall thy name no where be found anymore

when was it that they who dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight or what people have so kept thy commandments thou shall find that you all by name had kept thy precepts but not the heathen

thy heart had gone too far in this world and think thou to comprehend the way of the most high

as thou know not what is the way of the spirit nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou know not the works of what makes all

god is the greatest teacher

an enthusiastic person who is very logical with his or her own thinking process he or she can eventually express his or her thought with delight and humor to educate and entertain his or her audiences

qualification sans quality is no qualification at all

when you plan something that is unpragmatic it proves that you do not have a lot of knowledge about your topic that you are mentioning to others

if something traumatizes you please do not think that your life is coming to an end you will still have opportunities to resume with your life by speaking up and seeking for assistance

my mothers gifts of courage to me were both large and small the latter are woven so subtly into the fabric of my psyche that i can hardly distinguish where she stops and i begin

whenever i ask a question and the pain comes i know i have asked a really good question

education isn’t something your professors make for you it’s something you make for yourself

this is not education it is a process of manufacturing computation devices that look like homo sapiens

education means nourishing the mind and make it develop in order to see beyond the limitations of current social perception

the problem with studying is that it gets in the way of education

there is nothing to be gained by pretending that academic involvement is necessary or even always desirable in the quest for truth and knowledge

your world needs you so use your education to become endowed with muscles of iron and nerves of steel do not exploit the means of education to become a man or a woman use it to become a human being in the pursuit of excellence

all the good things on this earth are trophy cups the strong win them the weak lose them

from a speech by the nazi minister of education

this saturday as in tomorrow saturday we have to give lectures in twelve hours were not prepared for that i cant just pull a cybercrimes lecture out of my ass he could but it was the principle of the thing

the flow of knowledge towards the mind should be moderated by the faculties of the mind itself based on the acceptability of nothing but the mind

a carefully constructed structure of education is supposed to smoothen the pursuit of knowledge instead of restricting the flow of knowledge

there is a system alright but the actual element of education has long gone

knowledge is not power the correct application of knowledge is power

the way we can replenish our memories is to look back at textual information that we have either written or read before if that method is accomplished we can comprehend and complete tasks that require us to use more critical thinking

all systems of the society are meant to serve the mind not the mind to serve the systems

the known is finite the unknown is infinite intellectually we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability our business in every generation is to claim a little more land

learn japanese fast with our free podcasts and audio lessons our unique methods make learning japanese super easy download our mp files to listen and learn

indoctrination is not just demeaning to the human conscience it is lethal for the flourishing psychology of the hungry young mind

i want to learn i deserve to read and write thoughts for company and a pen for a voice who is more entitled to those privileges than i

the topics we learn from our four core subjects during our childhood and adolescent stage of our lives help us to understand the norms of common knowledge and take pride of our citizenship

its like a malicious person lifting a photograph from the developing chemicals too early and then pronouncing the photographer incompetent

uniform of a soldier and uniform of a student both are equally needed for the nation

the world needs the kind of education by means of which character is formed strength of the mind is increased and the human intellect is expanded beyond its own limits

education makes your maths better not necessarily your manners

i read the more you read the more the world opens up to you and the happier you are and more comforted you feel its up to you no you is educated who cannot educate himself

if you could arrange to avoid that routine jobworld you were an intellectual or an artist too restless tremorous agitated too mad to sit at a desk eight hours a day you needed an institution  a higher institution

education aims at solving problems but some educators are problems to be solved

so it is our request that you try to study bhagavadgītā as it is dont try to distort it by your socalled education try to understand kṛiṣṇa as he is saying then you will be benefited your life will be successful

to a lot of children school is currently mostly a place to learn what you aren’t any good at

religiousity is unself glory not purity

biting the hand that feeds you thats what youre doing mary logan biting the hand that feeds you

again mama laughed if thats the case daisy i dont think i need that little bit of food

with the second book finished she stared at a small pile of second grade books on her desk

well i just think youre spoiling those children mary theyve got to learn how things are sometime

maybe so said mama but that doesnt mean they have to accept them and maybe we dont either

you dont have to be the most educated or the most experienced to start the journey but the most willing to outlearn and outwork everyone around you

education and knowledge are no longer values of truth and beauty that make life worth living they are reduced to an economic means to the ends of greater pay and more consumption

the paradox of education is that any man only educated by others is an uneducated man without selfeducation you cannot be educated one in strict sense of this term

there is nothing hidden in the hidden time know that this the hidden time is your everlasting and live

cleave to the common good we are all responsible for bringing about the time of great suffering for its continuing

act correctly incorrect action cannot be justified by incorrect action an incorrect action taken to cover an incorrect action is doubly incorrect

the starvation of a child has no justification even if the crops have failed or the population is too large

the murder of a child has no justification even if the bombs have missed their mark

we have the power to move mountain if we have faith that the mountain can be moved

those of little understanding say the world will soon end it is the current age that is coming to an end the end of this age is the beginning of the next

all the truth of god are discoverable through every day life

the inner dimension and the hidden time have already been discovered

there is no truth without faith nothing is proven except to the heart of one who believes

the great lie that science has given us is that reality is material

science has given us a great lie it is this lie that ends the current age of faith in god

the great lie is like a sword that has been thrust into the heart of humankind

god is the one subject of reality take away the one subject and there is nothing real

the truths of the one subject have already been discovered but have not been accepted because they spell the death of the faith in the lie

humankind must no longer permit the lie to be taught to its children

the great lie can only be defeated by the new world order the sooner the new world order is established by the institutions of the world the sooner the suffering caused by the lie will end

the new world order is established by degrees the first degree is truth of the one subject which follows from the existence and the oneness of the universe and from the ancient belief that god is allknowing

it is far easier to move mountain than to move science by this one degree we have the power to move mountain if we have faith that the mountain can be moved it is now that our faith is tested the future of humankind hangs in the balance

focus on the end not the beginning on the beginning not the end the process proceeds in the inner dimension

there is no greater crime than a crime against humanity there is no greater crime against humanity than usury the greatest violence and the greatest threat to humanity is the growth of money

there is no greater crime against humanity than usury

the greatest violence and the greatest threat to humanity is the growth of money

in the new faith there is only one commandment it is this commandment and this commandment alone that must be followed to end the times of suffering which are soon to come forsake usury

those who have assets must withdraw them from the markets of loans do not accept notes of loan on speculation the time will soon come when you will gain no profits from the market of loans and your wealth will be taken by the very few

now hear of the new judgement you are judged many times more by what you do in groups than for what you do as individuals

you are judged many times more by what you do in groups than for what you do as individuals

you are judged many times more by what you give assent to others doing than what you do yourself

you are judged more by what you do passively than by what you do actively

if one billion of you watch and do not intercede as one million of you assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child then one billion of you are a billion times guilty

you are judged many times more by what you do in groups than for what you do as individuals if one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty

you are judged many times more by what you give assent to others doing than what you do yourself if one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child then one million of you are a million times guilty

justice is paramount the new judgement is the justice of the hidden time

the harder you search the more troubled you become

faith is the substance of things hoped for evidence of things not seen

hear about the hidden time some think the hidden time is yet to come the kingdom of god does not come by observation it is hidden in the inner dimension

justice is about harmony revenge is about you making yourself feel better

death is not considerate or fair

purity serenity solitude what you ought to uphold but the important thing is whether you believe it

you have strength born of years of grief and anger the strength of a man denied revenge

you have not escaped his notice either you are here by a call not by choice

patience it is not how quickly you run but how slowly

you are created invisible spiritually and invisibility is largely a matter of patience

we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places

anger does not change the fact the will to take control is everything

to conquer fear you must become fear

to conquer fear you must become fear  you must bask in the fear of the book and men fear most what they cannot see the power of the book is spiritual

death does not wait for you to be ready

it is right that one must come so far to see the world as it is meant to be

today death is your opponent

it is not enough to be a man

it is not enough to be a man you have to become an idea a terrible thought a wraith indeed become one with the darkness

by studying understanding and do the wills of the book you renounce your mortal life

to be a great warrior is not enough flesh and blood however skilled can be destroyed you must be more than just a man in minds of your opponents

dedicate your life to solitude and mortify your members which are upon the earth

you have purged your way you are ready to lead sons of men

you should assume the mantle of your birthright

when the pyramid falls the other cities will follow in short order natures balance will be restored and man will finally return to solitude

your maker has rescued you from the darkest corner of your own heart what he asks in return is obedience and the courage to do what is necessary

throughout the ages the wisdom has been taught now the language has changed and truth is given in the language of science

you are alone but you seems not afraid though you weary with your groaning wandering far off in the wilderness and your eyes consumed because of your grief waxed old while youre still young

the kingdom of god does not come by observation it is hidden in the inner dimension

the hidden time is an eternity that runs through every moment it is alltime the hidden time is a thread and moments are the beads on the thread

get your knowledge quickly and then use it if you can use it you will retain it

i see youve confused what youre learning in school with actual education

i learned how to argue they called it ‘debate’ i learned how to worship i learned how to become an eager worker and a passive consumer

but i didn’t learn anything practical like how to purify water build a home start a fire grow food or survive without the help of corporations

the purpose of education should be characterbuilding

civilization is not inherited it has to be learned and earned by each generation anew…

our state of mind defines our character whether it is or not socially acceptable toward othersthis is the way it can part of our identities when we communicate with our surroundings in our everyday life

a person who has proper guidance from his or her early childhood can himself or herself expanding his or her horizons living in a well established environment with great level of knowledge and being financially stable

a phd does not automatically denote wisdom merely perseverance

knowledge is worth nothing until it is put to practice

growing up i knew where the world ended i could see it at the horizon where the sky touched the corn my life was bounded and known i knew the edges of the world and then i went to college

my grief were thoroughly weighed and my calamity laid in the balances together for now it would be heavier than the sand of the desert

what is my strength that i should hope is my strength the strength of stone or is my flesh of brass is not my help in me

wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life unto the bitter in soul which long for death but it cometh not and dig for it more than for hid treasures which rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave

one generation passes away and another generation cometh forth but the earth abides for ever

all things are full of labour man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing

the thing that had been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done

there is no new thing under the sun is there any thing whereof it may be said see this is new it had been already of old time which was before us

all the labour of man is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not filled

all this have i proved by wisdom i said i will be wise but it was far from me that which is far off exceeding deep who can find it out

your whole being is deeply troubled personified the vision of a childs purity lost in the wilderness of an everunchanging and imperfect world

loneliness is your only companion

only dead surpasses the sufferings

you havent rewarded evil unto them who were at peace with you nor you have delivered them that without cause is your enemy but they want to tread down your soul upon the earth and lay your honour in the dust

many are they that rise up against you many there be which say of your soul ‘’there is no help for you’’ but the instruments of death is prepared for your cause

every once in a while you need to challenge yourself and learn new things

unless there is some kind of spiritual revolution that can keep abreast of our technological genius it is unlikely that we will save our planet a purely rational education will not suffice

everything has changed   except the way we think the aim of education must be the training of independently acting and thinking individuals who however see in the service of community their highest life problems

a genuine education must somehow serve the wings of spirit and imagination that each child brings to life

the biological equipment of a man rigidly restricts the field in which he can serve

if people institute wrong institutions wrong institutions do not just produce wrong people but wrong people who understand and accept mediocrity as an institution

education is not only filling the mind with knowledge but it is igniting the candle that enlightens the mind

if you have knowledge then use it for educating not for degrading

the best thing that can happen to anyone is for them to gain an education that is aligned to their purpose in life

children who once looked to their parents for leadership now turn to their teachers for knowledge their peers for wisdom and their music and televisions for entertainment

i am not a books warm but i like books too much

what youre saying i clarify through clenched teeth is that call boys dont make it far in government

teaching is not only a profession but it a is a purpose of a great life

a persons practical experience can attribute him or her to teach his or her fellow learners the value of real life responsibilities and its consequences

it is possible to find the passion to read

no one was born a reader we learn to build the habit of reading

a teacher can change a life just with appreciation and love

irinistic motivation can help people attain academic success and possess themselves with great depth of knowledge

a great teacher is one that helps their students to become great in return the students appreciate the teacher for their success

being fatigued and restless about challenging responsibilities could not lead you to a situation of yourself being highly respected about your dignity and accomplishments

education is a relentless voyage of discovery

if we throw blankets over our childrens dreams we darken their world and extinguish their desire to live

there is a miracle in your mess dont let the mess make you miss the miracle

for those of you who may be homeschooled high school is that fouryear asylum where they put teenagers because we have no idea what else to do with them

the real flight of this hawk is impending

stillthis bird is yet to be tested for real

though i have leaped over the seas

wellthe entire sky is still remaining to fly

and make sure that i am gonna do it with all my heart and all my soul

god is not interested in helping you finding out why you are in a mess he is interested in fixing it

arleen thanked pana getting off the phone she thanked jesus she smiled when she smiled she looked like a different person the press had loosened its grip from landlords she had heard eightynine nos but one yes

education being a change of behavior as a result of experience brings about wisdom and knowledge while knowledge comes from what we read or study wisdom comes from what we observe and experience

the purpose of education is not to affect negatively but to positively affect when i see people using whatever wisdom or knowledge they have to cheat i see an abuse of education all borne out of ignorance

i do not have any trust fund i have always trusted god for all my funds

god always sees me with no makeups on because he knew how we started

it is our responsibility to discover our talents to accept them as from god to develop them through education and training and to use them for his glory

many contemporary critics of higher education similarly posit a golden age but no one knows when it was supposed to exist

my advice for those of you who felt being marginalised undervalued and taken for granted guess what that is the arena where god creates leaders

it’s when your plans look dead that god’s resurrection power begins to operate in your life in greater measure

i would rather have a man chasing jesus than a house full of stuffs and garrage filled with big cars

raise your children with right values and education you may end up living frugal but you will die rich else you will live rich but die poor

of what use is my going to church every day and still come home and remain the same of what use is my attending the mosques and the next day i enter the mall with knives and start slaughtering people in the name of religion

god is a god of variety he was not stupid creating all of us different with our uniqueness

can we forgive those who have offended us yes and some will say no but never forget that you are not worthy but god still forgives you even till the last hour of your life

if god can love us against all our atrocities why cant we learn to love one another

if you ask mei will say lets go back to our source he has never lost any battle i am a living witness

education without discipline and integrity is a waste

a man who acquires school certificates but lacks self discipline and integrity is not educated

there must always be an opposition because the enemy always opposes what the lord has declared

there is a skill to learning it is all about what is and what is not while science is knowing what is art is creating what is not

study for knowledge not for marks if you have the knowledge you will get the marks

education gives you the ability to know it intelligence gives you the capacity to fix it wisdom lets you know when to do it

those who do not continuously seek knowledge are content to settle for mediocrity

i didnt come from a success lineage but i am so glad that my earthly lineage is not my final story because when i gave my life to jesus twelve years back god interrupted my story

never let your education interfere with your learning

all the failures in my life freed me from all my fears so that i can succeed

be careful because gods gifts alone are not able to give you joy gods gift can only bring you joy when they are joined with your gratitude

sometimes what not to do is more important than what to do sometimes when you are in crisis when frustration are high or when you are under pressure what you dont do is more important than what you do dont be afraid

whenever you are in transition it is always important to choose the words that you use you call it crises in your life and i call it transition

be careful the mistake of yesterday always lives with tomorrow

if you never listen you cant see the devil has got so many people so disconnected that they cannot even listen or even sense when the lord is speaking

christians we cannot be allowed to be fractured at a time like this there are more of us there are more of light in us than in the agents of darkness

i dont want to settle down because god has satisfied me and heard my prayers i want to stay hungry and thirsty for the things of god

this is not the first time that the world has been in a mess but you are still god you left us on the earth not only to preach in a building but to be the church beyond the buildings

before we can fix the situation we have to first see the situation the world cant see straight right now some are blinded by hatred rage fear scepticism some are blinded by their pains

we need to praypray that god open our eyes to see the problem from the source and not from the surface

you cannot solve a situation that you cannot see correctly

the agenda of the media is not to inform you they dont care about you they are trying to show you the truth there are some intelligent christians but they cant find them and put on the air for instance me

what do we do

my answer stop looking for practical advice dont be afraid  those who are with us are more than those who are with them

god always wants us to see things from heavens prospective you may not be doing much to your community but what you are is so important you are significant

mans panic does not produce gods powersometimes you need to pray before you post on social media

five minutes after something happened might not be the best time for you to get into your facebook and tell everybody mens panic does not produce gods power

conflict is much the same injustice and inequality is nothing new to our generation only the contest has changed because not only that everyone has opinion but they also have an opportunity to voice it and that is a bit dangerous

the conflict hasnt gotten worst but the contest has really changed

all of my life god has allowed me to share prospectives with people who are different you cannot lead people whose prospective you are not willing to understand

surrounded by enemies surrounded by evil surrounded by darkness injusticedont be afraid  those who are with us are more than those who are with them

whenever someone is a threat to the enemy there will be an attack dispatched against that person to try to minimise their effectiveness

there is power in the word of god if used properly

there is a remedy and there is a hope but the remedy is not in the political party or in places that will take you away from hope you better run to god that is the only place you can find both

gratitude without practicing maybe like practicing a faith without good work a grateful heart is not enough without a grateful habit because your joy is not produced by what you put in your heart but by habit you put in your life

education at a deep level means to ‘lead out’ what is trying to be born from within the job of a true teacher is to help awaken the inner pupil that has its own way of being and unique way of perceiving

the world

all my pains has always increased my sense of purpose

esmenda jenkins dube the first was all about fair

and saw her house as an oasis in the middle

of corruption saw herself as a missionary

converting stupidity into reason she thought

that was much more useful than a miracle

its a most serious mistake to think that learning is an activity separate from the rest of life that people do it best when they are not doing anything else and best of all in places where nothing else is done p

when you do away with god you become your own god because you recognise no greater power in the universe than yourself

christian education places its emphasis on unity in relationships between people

we wonder why we get credits only to be indebted

words are great but actions speak louder

try one behavior strategy and be consistent watch what happens

but the attitude reading and writing

gives you

pisa was developed by a kind of think tank for the developed world called the organization for economic cooperation and development and the scientist at the center of the experiment was andreas schleicher

the whole purpose of education is to create a window of the mind through which you can see the world look through that window with your own profound love joy harmony and gratitude

i have graduated to the extent of not asking what is happening in my life because i trust the makergod

i have my priorities and i know my purpose i do not praise god because of my pain but i praise him because of what the pain is producing

if you can feed in the presence of your enemies if you can be blessed under the weight of burdens when you praise god in pain it is preparation for provision

when you praise god in pain it is preparing you for provision

the things i call crisis and all the things that were coming after me are all coming to serve the purpose of god in my life

god made my enemies to serve me in my absence god made the things that conspired to destroy me feed me into the place that he was preparing for me i am a big girl and i can handle trouble and my enemies

learn to eat with your enemies all around you but most of all thank god for his presence keep your eyes fixed to the presence of god in the presence of your enemies

i have learned to thank god for what i cannot see i have learned to trust god with what i cannot

thank god even though in bad times not only in your good this is a graduated form of gratitude

education ignites the lights in the darkness of life

intelligence and perserverance cannot defeat the purpose of popularity because it can describe a trait of a successful person who is prominent

the one great art is that of making a complete human being of oneself

only the foolish would think that wisdom is something to keep locked in a drawer only the fearful would feel empowerment is something best kept to oneself or the few and not shared with all

we are born we get names we get educated we get values we get job and money but all this is not life life is love found in friendship friendship found in love and in love sacrifice vijay

everyone is an idiot not just the people with low sat scores the only differences among us is that were idiots about different things at different times no matter how smart you are you spend much of your day being an idiot

punctuation was it is sad to say invented a very long time ago even more frustrating it has remained with us ever since

i dont just have only the peace of god i do also have a god who gives peace not just resources but the revelation of his presence

what wasting time means at the time we glorify self instead of glorify god at that time we are wasting our time as god is time

you will always end up in frustration whenever you try to produce outside your purpose

some people are disappointed in their life because they are trying to use the tools that god did not authorised them to use in their life trying to build on a purpose that is not even attached in their personality

i am so glad that gods disappointment in me is not greater than his love and i still have a destiny i am growing in grace and mercy because that is the only soil that can produce the kind of life that god desires

in gods presence i find peace that is much deeper than any disappointment i will grow and i understand i cant grow myself that is why i need god and his grace

in god’s kingdom there are no overnight sensations or flashinthepan successes

if you cant see the assets in you it will be hard for you to export it to the world recognise who you are and the world will recognise you

a calamity can horrify an individual who is obsessed about life destruction and that particular individual could not indulge the beauty of living for the rest of his or her natural life

you cant disappoint what god has appointed

sometimes we want god to use us to do big things when we would not even want to do the basics

some people want to kill goliath but they do not want to attend to sheep how can god use you to kill giants if you cannot follow simple instructions

young teachers are forced to go through possibly the most rigorous courses of indoctrination available in any universities

whoever trains the children controls the future a chain is only as strong as its weakest link and a society will only ever be as strong as the families in it

god wants to use you right where you are with what you have not what you do not have

dont think because you cant affect something at a great level that god cant use you in a great way david didnt even train one day with the armies but he won the war he didnt even have a weapon but he killed a giant

a persons reputation can be appealing towards others if he or she understands the great values of ethical behavior

freedom comes from focus focus brings freedom focus on fear you will always be in prison focus on faith and is nothing the world can keep you knocked down

the forgiveness of god flows through me and because i am forgiven i can forgive

if you ask me i think the greatest breakthrough each and everyone of us need is not on finance marriage work relationship own house car but self the first breakthrough should start from being selfish

in dealing with us god always starts with our motives what do you want for the people what does god wants for his people what do you want him to do for you thats is a starting place

sometimes the fact that you cant sense god isnt an indication that he is not there it is just an indication that you are hanging out in the wrong placethe cave is not a physical location it is a state of mind

what is your motive when you go to church to feed or to be fed to serve or to be served to worship or to be worshipped to praise or to be praised to teach or to learn to give or to receive

remember the woman with the issue of blood did not met jesus in the church blind barthimus was blind though he could hear did not see jesus but heard about jesus passing i am just wondering how many people have heard about jesus through you

who was this man interested in your answer might be jesus of course but definitely not the man loves himself and so was seeking healing even when the crowd could not allow him see jesus

let the crowd in the church not deceive you because god usually speak to one a bit deep

dear lord please show me what really matters so that i may be able to determine what is distraction and gods direction in my life

before marriage opposite attracts after marriage opposite attacks☺ just telling you the truth

long before something happens in our life it happened in our heart

why do people go to church on sundays a question that is very complicated because i know what the answer is supposed to be but i do not really know the answer

i think people go because it is a kind of tradition

i think some goes because someone told them if tgey do not they might go to hell

maybe some go to look for a wife or husband ☺

maybe some go to church to display their latest designer shoes or handbags

some goes just to please their pastor

some people go to church because they love the music or the preaching

some goes because of some social reasons and friendship

some have it in their mind that they will experience the presence of god in the church

some goes to church because of miracle

some goes to church when they are expecting something maybe child comfort marriage work etc

some felt it is an obligation to give god a day out of the seven days he created

let me tell you that church is not there to entertain you ephesians  there are things going on in the church that some people barely know about

ask yourself today why do i go to church i am sure a sincere answer will help you

the enemies agenda is destruction his strategy is division and his tactics is on little differences mind you he is not going to be happy until he sees you divided

what starts in the heart doesnt stay in the heart it either turn into action or words

god takes two and make them one but satan takes one and make it two

if god can help us locate demands he can also help us locate the leaks

being married or being in a close relationship is not based on how quickly you can get offended but on how you are ready to drop the offences get over it and move ahead

if i should be available to everyone i will eventually end up with nothing to give to anyone so the greatest gift you can receive from me is my time count yourself lucky if i give you a minute of my hour

gods voice will be heard in the cave but only his visions will be revealed to you on the mountain a bit deep god will always love you and will always speak to you but when you lose your perspective you wont see his plan

offence is an event offended is a decision offence and offended we have to live through it but to stay offended to live in that place denies the very nature of the salvation that you claimed to have received

real faith looks beneath the surface real faith knows that faith works sometimes in dark places real faith knows that sometimes in order to see a change you will have to steer through your situation to really see it

gods perspectives requires persistence to have gods perspective in the world we live in requires persistence

have you ever make out time to ask god if there is anything or anybody you need to drop in your life are you still holding on to offences when is the right time to drop it

i am sure once you make this attempt he will show you

i declare that god is going to set some captives free

have you ever asked yourself this question what can god do through me the preacher has no platform if the people has no sense of mission

it is weird to me on how people will come to church frequently and have absolutely no desire or intention to change anything about their life based on what they experienced in the church

stop praying to god to change your marriage or your finances because you might end up seeing that you are the one that need the change not your marriage or finances

your past days are behind you and what god has for you is in front of you just pay attention

being graded for memorizing male accomplishments with the deep message that we can learn what others do but never do it ourselves

what you see and what you listen to will determine how high you will go

the more desperate the situation the more opportunity for miracle if you need something from god you need to be at the right place the right position and at the right time

knowledge and education are the key to this human tragedy which is a bonfire of hate fueled by ignorance

knowledge is a unique kind of property indeed you can share it with others while still possessing it

there is a throne up there and someone is sitting on it it is not you the economy or your government my god is still on the throne and i shall not worry

my faith gives me the ability to say whatever is next im ready if it is hillary or trump i am ready because they might sit on the desk but they do not sit on the throne

you dont have to feel grateful in order to be grateful

the size of a plane does not change the weather but it will get you above it the size of your faith may not change your situation but it will get you over it

learning is easy misunderstanding makes it complex

if doctor means master teacher then i think teaching in k for  years deserves said title our practicum is potent and our expertise is in the service of children in fact i might start calling myself dr vilson on principle

a wiz does not only rely on his or her peers for assistance however he or she will unleash his or her exceptional accomplishments by working wisely and independently

there is no where that life problem can take you that gods presence cannot reach you there is nothing that people can do to you that can keep god from getting to you

disposal of thoughts would diminish your intelligence level and you would not be able to fulfill critical responsibilities that would revolve throughout your life

you have a standing invitation to experience gods presence but you have to pay attention because attention creates access

sometimes we are asking god to reveal his presence provisions and purpose in our lives and we pray like we are trying to get gods attention but i think prayer has less with getting gods attention but he getting mine

evil is real but god is greater

god always have a perfect way for every imperfect situations
