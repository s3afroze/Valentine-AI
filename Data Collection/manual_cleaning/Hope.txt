when we love we always strive to become better than we are when we strive to become better than we are everything around us becomes better too

hold fast to dreams

for if dreams die

life is a brokenwinged bird

that cannot fly

i like the night without the dark wed never see the stars

its really a wonder that i havent dropped all my ideals because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out yet i keep them because in spite of everything i still believe that people are really good at heart

hope is the thing with feathers

that perches in the soul

and sings the tune without the words

and never stops at all

they say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world someone to love something to do and something to hope for

live then and be happy beloved children of my heart and never forget that until the day god will deign to reveal the future to man all human wisdom is contained in these two words wait and hope

if youre reading this

congratulations youre alive

if thats not something to smile about

then i dont know what is

the world is indeed full of peril and in it there are many dark places but still there is much that is fair and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief it grows perhaps the greater

you cannot swim for new horizons until you have courage to lose sight of the shore

and now these three remain faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love

lifes under no obligation to give us what we expect

but i know somehow that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars

if pain must come may it come quickly because i have a life to live and i need to live it in the best way possible if he has to make a choice may he make it now then i will either wait for him or forget him

blessed is he who expects nothing for he shall never be disappointed

the things you do for yourself are gone when you are gone but the things you do for others remain as your legacy

smiles from the threshold of the year to come

whispering it will be happier

the very least you can do in your life is figure out what you hope for and the most you can do is live inside that hope not admire it from a distance but live right in it under its roof

maybe everyone can live beyond what theyre capable of

its amazing how a little tomorrow can make up for a whole lot of yesterday

tears shed for another person are not a sign of weakness they are a sign of a pure heart

strange as it may seem i still hope for the best even though the best like an interesting piece of mail so rarely arrives and even when it does it can be lost so easily

i dont think of all the misery but of the beauty that still remains

when you have lost hope you have lost everything and when you think all is lost when all is dire and bleak there is always hope

its going to be all right sir harry said over and over again more worried by dumbledores silence than he had been by his weakened voice were nearly there  i can apparate us both back  dont worry

i am not worried harry said dumbledore his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water i am with you

there is a crack in everything

thats how the light gets in

never lose hope storms make people stronger and never last forever

we dream to give ourselves hope to stop dreaming  well that’s like saying you can never change your fate

to love life to love it even

when you have no stomach for it

and everything youve held dear

crumbles like burnt paper in your hands

your throat filled with the silt of it

when grief sits with you its tropical heat

thickening the air heavy as water

more fit for gills than lungs

when grief weights you like your own flesh

only more of it an obesity of grief

you think how can a body withstand this

then you hold life like a face

between your palms a plain face

no charming smile no violet eyes

and you say yes i will take you

i will love you again

hope is a waking dream

this is where it all begins everything starts here today

do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for

the best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something don’t wait for good things to happen to you if you go out and make some good things happen you will fill the world with hope you will fill yourself with hope

there is a saying in tibetan tragedy should be utilized as a source of strength

no matter what sort of difficulties how painful experience is if we lose our hope thats our real disaster

it is often in the darkest

skies that we see the

i used to think i was the strangest person in the world

but then i thought there are so many people in the world there must be someone just like me who feels bizarre and flawed in the same ways i do

i would imagine her and imagine that she must be out there thinking of me too

well i hope that if you are out there you read this and know that yes it’s true i’m here and i’m just as strange as you

fairy tales do not tell children the dragons exist children already know that dragons exist fairy tales tell children the dragons can be killed

if you can love someone with your whole heart even one person then theres salvation in life even if you cant get together with that person

hope is a good breakfast but it is a bad supper

when it was dark you always carried the sun in your hand for me

my life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes

shoot for the moon even if you fail youll land among the stars

remember hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies

the road that is built in hope is more pleasant to the traveler than the road built in despair even though they both lead to the same destination

we are all the pieces of what we remember we hold in ourselves the hopes and fears of those who love us as long as there is love and memory there is no true loss

one lives in the hope of becoming a memory

a baby is gods opinion that the world should go on

we need never be hopeless because we can never be irreperably broken

the first duty of a man is to think for himself

for like a shaft clear and cold the thought pierced him that in the end the shadow was only a small and passing thing there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach

to be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic it is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty but also of compassion sacrifice courage kindness

we must accept finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope

keep your best wishes close to your heart and watch what happens

books are finite sexual encounters are finite but the desire to read and to fuck is infinite it surpasses our own deaths our fears our hopes for peace

when youre at the end of your rope tie a knot and hold on

since i was young i have always known this life damages us every one we can’t escape that damage but now i am also learning this we can be mended we mend each other

write it on your heart

that every day is the best day in the year

he is rich who owns the day and no one owns the day

who allows it to be invaded with fret and anxiety

finish every day and be done with it

you have done what you could

some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in

forget them as soon as you can tomorrow is a new day

begin it well and serenely with too high a spirit

to be cumbered with your old nonsense

this new day is too dear

with its hopes and invitations

to waste a moment on the yesterdays

the heart dies a slow death shedding each hope like leaves until one day there are none no hopes nothing remains

i mean at the end of the day what the hell does it matter who i end up with if it cant be you

oft hope is born when all is forlorn

four be the things i am wiser to know

idleness sorrow a friend and a foe

four be the things id been better without

love curiosity freckles and doubt

three be the things i shall never attain

envy content and sufficient champagne

three be the things i shall have till i die

laughter and hope and a sock in the eye

to love means loving the unlovable to forgive means pardoning the unpardonable faith means believing the unbelievable hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless

in a world filled with hate we must still dare to hope in a world filled with anger we must still dare to comfort in a world filled with despair we must still dare to dream and in a world filled with distrust we must still dare to believe

its the children the world almost breaks who grow up to save it

the very existence of libraries affords the best evidence that we may yet have hope for the future of man

to hear the phrase our only hope always makes one anxious because it means that if the only hope doesnt work there is nothing left

it is not despair for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt we do not

walk on with hope in your heart

and youll never walk alone

you do not need to know precisely what is happening or exactly where it is all going what you need is to recognize the possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment and to embrace them with courage faith and hope

how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive

its like a drop of honey a field of tulips blooming in the springtime its a fresh rain a whispered promise a cloudless sky the perfect punctuation mark at the end of a sentence and its the only thing in the world keeping me afloat

though nothing can bring back the hour

of splendor in the grass of glory in the flower

we will grieve not rather find

strength in what remains behind

in the primal sympathy

which having been must ever be

one child one teacher one book one pen can change the world

we need hope or else we cannot endure

you may choose to look the other way but you can never say again that you did not know

yesterday is but a dream

tomorrow is only a vision

but today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope

take this kiss upon the brow

and in parting from you now

you are not wrong who deem

that my days have been a dream

yet if hope has flown away

in a night or in a day

in a vision or in none

is it therefore the less gone

all that we see or seem

is but a dream within a dream

i stand amid the roar

and i hold within my hand

grains of the golden sand

how few yet how they creep

through my fingers to the deep

while i weep while i weep

o god can i not grasp

them with a tighter clasp

o god can i not save

one from the pitiless wave

is all that we see or seem

but a dream within a dream

do not lose hope — what you seek will be found trust ghosts trust those that you have helped to help you in their turn trust dreams trust your heart and trust your story from instructions

i turned in my seat will’s face was in shadow and i couldn’t quite make it out

‘just hold on just for a minute’

‘are you all right’ i found my gaze dropping towards his chair afraid some part of him was pinched or trapped that i had got something wrong

‘i’m fine i just    ’

i could see his pale collar his dark suit jacket a contrast against it

‘i don’t want to go in just yet i just want to sit and not have to think about    ’ he swallowed

even in the halfdark it seemed effortful

‘i just    want to be a man who has been to a concert with a girl in a red dress just for a few minutes more’

i released the door handle

i closed my eyes and lay my head against the headrest and we sat there together for a while longer two people lost in remembered music half hidden in the shadow of a castle on a moonlit hill

if you choose

it may not be very useful but it is beautiful

and sometimes it is enough

it all counts adam said again and the bottom line is what defines you isnt how many times you crash but the number of times you get back on the bike as long as its one more youre all goodpg  along for the ride

everything is relative in this world where change alone endures

if you lose hope somehow you lose the vitality that keeps moving you lose that courage to be that quality that helps you go on in spite of it all and so today i still have a dream

tell me there is still good in the world tell me there is still hope for all of us

so i take my past experiences and try to regret nothing

drizzt dourden

stop trying to be less of who you are let this time in your life cut you open and drain all of the things that are holding you back

things will get easier peoples minds will change and you should be alive to see it

when you have a great and difficult task something perhaps almost impossible if you only work a little at a time every day a little suddenly the work will finish itself

rules for happiness something to do someone to love something to hope for

i am heartbroken but i have been heartbroken before and this might be the best for which i can hope

hope does not leave without being given permission

there is nothing more majestic than the determined courage of individuals willing to suffer and sacrifice for their freedom and dignity

hed do what he always did find the sweet among the bitter

work until your eyes are tired and head is heavy and keep working even after that

i’m doing just fine

there is strange comfort in knowing that no matter what happens today the sun will rise again tomorrow

it was never about the world being too big it was more like she was too much for the world to handle

a child who does not think about what happens around him and is content with living without wondering whether he lives honestly is like a man who lives from a scoundrels work and is on the road to being a scoundrel

dont despair despair suggests you are in total control and know what is coming you dont  surrender to events with hope

theres a taste in the air sweet and vaguely antiseptic that reminds him of his teenage years in these streets and of a general state of longing a hunger for life to begin that from this distance seems like happiness

maybe i hope too much maybe i dream too much or maybe i love too much to just give up on you

once you choose hope anythings possible

love doesnt come with an onoff switch its made of too many threads of memory and hope and heartache that weave themselves into the very core of who you are

religion n a daughter of hope and fear explaining to ignorance the nature of the unknowable

blind broke jobless and frustrated kevin found it difficult to get through the following few months but he had one big thing going for him

he was sober

it was a new beginning

the struggles we endure today will be the ‘good old days’ we laugh about tomorrow

but what is hope nothing but the paint on the face of existence the least touch of truth rubs it off and then we see what a hollowcheeked harlot we have got hold of

sober gainfully employed and physically secure once again kevin began to relax his confidence slowly returned for the first time since the onset of his blindness he let his guard down and a crack in his carefully constructed veneer formed

and with it hope

you couldnt erase the past you couldnt even change it but sometimes life offered you the opportunity to put it right

you never really know whats coming a small wave or maybe a big one all you can really do is hope that when it comes you can surf over it instead of drown in its monstrosity

to plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow

in the midst of winter i find within me the invisible summer

i inhale hope with every breath i take

sometimes its easy to lose faith in people and sometimes one act of kindness is all it takes to give you hope again

the sun shall always rise upon a new day and there shall always be a rose garden within me yes there is a part of me that is broken but my broken soil gives way to my wild roses

hope keeps you alive

nikolai had been told that hope was dangerous had been warned of it many times but he’d never believed that hope was the wind that came from nowhere to fill your sails and carry you home

then i choose to drown in hope rather than float into nothing

faith is the very first thing you should pack in a hope chest

it will get easier each time i think i hope i just have to keep trying

to hope for nothing to expect nothing to demand nothing this is analytical despair

we must pass through the darkness to reach the light

where does the rainbow end

in your soul or on the horizon

hope is a passion for the possible

and remember you must never under any circumstances despair to hope and to act these are our duties in misfortune

when you get ill do not get nervous about it and try as much as possible to be hopeful

even if you find him even if he didnt leave you on purpose he cant possibly live up to the person youve built him into

the human soul has still greater need of the ideal than of the real it is by the real that we exist it is by the ideal that we live

a call to action had been born

she was a ray of sunshine a warm summer rain a bright fire on a cold winter’s day and now she could be dead because she had tried to save the man she loved

hope is a dangerous thing raisa thought once kindled its hard to put out it makes wise people into fools

you didnt think i really liked you do you think i really like you now

he turned toward her uncertainty in his faceyou did go quite a lot of effort to be having this conversation but i dont want to read too much of what i hope into that

val stretched out beside him resting her head in the crook of his arm what do you hope

he pulled her close hands careful not to touch her wounds as they wrapped around her i hope that you feel for me as i do for you he said his voice like a sigh against her throat

and how is that she asked her lips so close to his jaw that she could taste the salt of his skin when she moved them

you carried my heart in your hands tonight he said but i have felt as if you carried it long before that

she smiled and let her eyes drift closed they lay there together under the bridge city lights burning outside the windows like a sky full of falling stars as they slid off into sleep

let my body dwell in poverty and my hands be as the hands of the toiler but let my soul be as a temple of remembrance where the treasures of knowledge enter and the inner sanctuary is hope

i can do this… i can start over i can save my own life and i’m never going to be alone as long as i have stars to wish on and people to still love

fear is the glue that keeps you stuck faith is the solvent that sets you free

hope was tricky like water somehow it always found a way in

i know now after fifty years that the findinglosing forgettingremembering leavingreturning never stops the whole of life is about another chance and while we are alive till the very end there is always another chance

i’ll make a swing so i can reach the places i can’t reach yet

i am and always will be the optimist the hoper of farflung hopes and the dreamer of improbable dreams

i am not afraid to die i am only afraid of saying goodbye to you forever

well and good if all things change o lord god provided i am rooted in you

because hope comes from in you and wishes are just magic

it felt like id been living underground and for a moment id been given this glimpse of the sky once youve seen that how can you go back where you came from

is there a chance

a fragment of light at the end of the tunnel

a reason to fight

is there a chance you may change your mind

or are we ashes and wine

i thought hope cannot be said to exist nor can it be said not to exist it is just like roads across the earth for actually the earth had no roads to begin with but when many men pass one way a road is made

you’re not a bad person you’re just a little bit different and i’m a sucker for that

you are where you need to be just take a deep breath

she wildly burned for the one she loved and he stood there watching hoping he too would catch a blaze from the violence stirring in her heart

maybe love was meant to save us from ourselves

but human beings are not machines and however powerful the pressure to conform they sometimes are so moved by what they see as injustice that they dare to declare their independence in that historical possibility lies hope

the rest is just wishes and hope the most fragile of things

but she loves me me just the way i am

dead my old fine hopes

and dry my dreaming but still

iris blue each spring

perhaps it takes a purer faith to praise god for unrealized blessings than for those we once enjoyed or those we enjoy now

but dear don’t be afraid of love it’s only magic

i could recognise his soul in mine as much as he could find me in his our sole existences seemed to have been for this very moment when nothing else mattered

believe it is possible to solve your problem tremendous things happen to the believer so believe the answer will come it will

read this to yourself read it silently

dont move your lips dont make a sound

listen to yourself listen without hearing anything

what a wonderfully weird thing huh

now make this part loud

scream it in your mind

drown everything out

now hear a whisper a tiny whisper

now read this next line in your best crotchety

hello there sonny does your town have a post office

awesome who was that whose voice was that

it sure wasnt yours

how do you do that

how

it mustve been magic

i looked for that which is not nor can be

and hope deferred made my heart sick in truth

but years must pass before a hope of youth

i watched and waited with a steadfast will

and though the object seemed to flee away

that i so longed for ever day by day

i watched and waited still

sometimes i said this thing shall be no more

my expectation wearies and shall cease

i will resign it now and be at peace

yet never gave it oer

sometimes i said it is an empty name

i long for to a name why should i give

the peace of all the days i have to live

yet gave it all the same

for healthy joy and salutary pain

thou knowest the chase useless and again

turnest to follow it

i embraced a cloud

but when i soared

it rained

a weak but steady throb lay beneath kevs searching fingertips wins heartbeatthe pulse that sustained his universe

but hope rises like water trapped by a dam higher and higher in increments that mean nothing until you face the flood

how fortunate we were who still had hope i did not then realise i could not know how soon the time would come when we should have no more hope and yet be unable to die

my pride shut me up my hurt shut me down and together they ganged up on my hope and let her get away

truly that is what it feels like but that feeling is a trial that wont last forever  never give up

it was time to let go of the mad desire to remember it was time to start living whatever life would come in the present not the past

i knew i was alone in a way that no earthling has ever been before

i need you because i know i deserve you but let me fall in love with you one last time before i let go so i can remember the beautiful imperfection that rattled my bones

there is always a part of my mind that is preparing for the worst and another part of my mind that believes if i prepare enough for it the worst won’t happen

let this time in your life cut you open and drain all of the things that are holding you back i’m going to help you forgive the things that you won’t let yourself forget

she was completely whole

and yet never fully complete

a person can do incredible things if he or she has enough hope

it is not as much about who you used to be as it is about who you choose to be

you spend your whole life looking for answers because you think the next answer will solve all your problems make you a little less miserable because when you run out of questions you dont just run out of answers you run out hope

nothing is predestined the obstacles of your past can become the gateways that lead to new beginnings

he leaned her back against the tub setting her head on the edge then washed her shoulders

i know i left you once

she opened her mouth wanting to say it didnt matter it was forgotten but it wasnt

i know i hurt you

again she wanted to argue but she couldnt

i know i said i wont leave you again but i also know thats not enough and that the only way youre going to trust that i wont leave is if i dont

he slid the cloth over her arms

if this ends hope it wont be me that ends it i think you know that

right now were living in an ugly chapter of our lives but books always get better

hang in there it is astonishing how short a time it can take for very wonderful things to happen

hope in the shadow of fear is the worlds most powerful motivator

the difference between hope and despair is a different way of telling stories from the same facts

dont die on me she ordered you are not dying on me

yes maam he felt lightheaded but she was about the most beautiful thing hed ever seen her hair was smoldering her face was smudged with soot she had a cut on her arm her dress was torn and she was missing a boot beautiful

look he said the point is there’s no way to be a hundred percent sure about anyone or anything so you’re left with a choice either hope for the best or just expect the worst

if you expect the worst you’re never disappointed i pointed out

yeah but who lives like that

therefore since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us be thankful and so worship god acceptably with reverence and awe for our god is a consuming fire

we look into each others eyes as we shake his are still full of death and horror but in them i see my face reflected and inside my tiny eyes inside his i think i see some hope

i am hope

that’s when it counts that’s when it matters the most

to have faith is to be sure of the things we hope for to be certain of the things we cannot see

there had to be dark and muddy waters so that the sun could have something to background its flashing glory

some day soon lance said youll walk out of here and have to decide how youre going to live the rest of your lives will you be defined by what other people see or by the essence of your soul

be sure to notice when youre happy

if it were not for hopes the heart would break

jayden laughed grimly press the attack and hope for the best

hope is not a strategy said kira

its not plan a said jayden and it shouldnt be plan b but it is every plan c that has ever been made

my grandpa had a saying before he died you can hope in one hand shit in the other and see which is filled first

lifes trials will test you and shape you but don’t let them change who you are

a brief for the defense

sorrow everywhere slaughter everywhere if babies

are not starving someplace they are starving

somewhere else with flies in their nostrils

but we enjoy our lives because thats what god wants

otherwise the mornings before summer dawn would not

be made so fine the bengal tiger would not

be fashioned so miraculously well the poor women

at the fountain are laughing together between

the suffering they have known and the awfulness

in their future smiling and laughing while somebody

in the village is very sick there is laughter

every day in the terrible streets of calcutta

and the women laugh in the cages of bombay

if we deny our happiness resist our satisfaction

we lessen the importance of their deprivation

we must risk delight we can do without pleasure

but not delight not enjoyment we must have

the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless

furnace of this world to make injustice the only

measure of our attention is to praise the devil

if the locomotive of the lord runs us down

we should give thanks that the end had magnitude

we must admit there will be music despite everything

we stand at the prow again of a small ship

anchored late at night in the tiny port

looking over to the sleeping island the waterfront

is three shuttered cafés and one naked light burning

to hear the faint sound of oars in the silence as a rowboat

comes slowly out and then goes back is truly worth

all the years of sorrow that are to come

there is nothing new under the sun but there are new suns

when by my solitary hearth i sit

when no fair dreams before my mind’s eye flit

and the bare heath of life presents no bloom

and wave thy silver pinions o’er my head

trump’s america is not america not today’s or tomorrow’s but yesterday’s

trump’s america is brutal perverse regressive insular and afraid there is no hope in it there is no light in it it is a vast expanse of darkness and desolation

and that is a vision of america that most of the people in this country cannot and will not abide

the problem with hope anne finds through the years is that it gets your hopes up but hopelessness is worse

every moment has its pleasures and its hope

courage will now be your best defence against the storm that is at hand—that and such hope as i bring

the way to screw up somebodys life is to give them what they want

i have come said a deep voice behind them they turned and saw the lion himself so bright and real and strong that everything else began at once to look pale and shadowy compared with him

you call it hope — that fire of fire

it is but agony of desire

look the trees exist the houses

we dwell in stand there stalwartly

only we

pass by it all like a rush of air

and everything conspires to keep quiet

about us

half out of shame perhaps half out of

some secret hope

everybody’s damaged it’s just a question of how badly and whether you’re healing or still bleeding

aura im really patient but im not a bloody saint

carry the fire

iris squeezed his hand dont lose hope frank rainbows always stand for hope

there are three lessons i would write

three words as with a burning pen

and gladness hides her face in scorn

put thou the shadow from thy brow

no night but hath its morn

have love not love alone for one

but man as man thy brother call

and scatter like the circling sun

thy charities on all

only those who still have hope can benefit from tears

in joined hands there is still some token of hope in the clinched fist none

i remember being scared that something must surely go wrong if we were this happy her and me in the early days when our love was settling into the shape of our lives like cake mixture reaching the corners of the tin as it swells and bakes

its in those quiet little towns at the edge of the world that you will find the salt of the earth people who make you feel right at home

go make your mark on the world be a world changer live bold for christ no matter the cost

and sometimes just sometimes

out of every hundred you are shinning

on the inside sometimes

sometimes on the same day

universe decides to reflect you on the

outside it decides to shine too so

you put a smile on your face take a

walk and watch it sharing your

happiness sharing your light breath

it all in take your boost and let the

world lift you up till you actually

believe that it has your back take the

gift and take your credit even if its

not your wings cause this universe

only reflects back it gifts back its

fair but it isnt an initiator and

maybe just maybe if you believe in it

it will believe in you too maybe then

when its raining on you when its too

dark when rock bottom gives you a

concussion you will look up with

faith and out of all the things

showering on your head you will find

your favorite one you will be gifted

with stars

ones that can reflect on your inside

ones that can light you up back

he believed in himself believed in his quixotic ambition letting the failures of the previous day disappear as each new day dawned yesterday was not today the past did not predict the future if he could learn from his mistakes

he hesitated remembering something finnikin had said to him on their journey that somehow even in the worst of times the tiniest fragments of good survive it was the grip in which one held those fragments that counted

believe in yourself your abilities and your own potential never let selfdoubt hold you captive you are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for

it is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature let any obstructing cause no matter what be removed in any way even by death and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment

remember red hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies i will be hoping that this letter finds you and finds you well

its just that right now i want to hear you promise me that if we do run out of time and i go mad like miranda it ends with me the curse ends here because our baby will be safe you will make that happen isnt that so

it took him a minute yes he said finnally its so although if were just going to talk about the baby i can think of an easier way to save her

oh what

id just lock her up from her sixteenth birthday on

lucy didnt laugh dont think i havent thought of that too love but heres the thing that parents try that in all the fairy tales it never works

i dont believe we shall ever again have any form of society in which men will be free one should not hope for it one should not hope for anything hope is invented by politicians to keep the electorate happy

the greatest act of faith some days is to simply get up and face another day

but what we call our despair is often only the painful eagerness of unfed hope

we need never be without hope because we can never be irreparably broken

people need stories child they bring us hope and that hope is real if thats the case what does it matter whether people in them actually lived

time has taught me not to lose hope yet not to trust too much in hope either

hope can get you through anything

no amount of me trying to explain myself was doing any good i didnt even know what was going on inside of me so how could i have explained it to them

hope was an instinct only the reasoning human mind could kill an animal never knew despair

but love like the sun that it is sets afire and melts everything what greed and privilege to build up over whole centuries the indignation of a pious spirit with its natural following of oppressed souls will cast down with a single shove

love without hope will not survive

love gives power to hope and faith

i came to the conclusion that unrealized hopes even small ones were always wrenching

god dances with the outcast

think big thoughts but relish small pleasures

i promise ill never tell

dont promise that he said in an ultraserious voice if they try to hurt you and the only way to protect yourself is to tell them what you know about me then you tell them straight off okay

no

no

i will possess your heart

heat flared along the back of my neck what did you say

my favorite song i will possess your heart

by death cab for cutie

he snorted no the little known ti hiphop remix yes death cab for cutie

why whats wrong with it

nothing but it doesnt seem to fit you its kind of a sad song

no its pure confident its not i want or i need none of that crap he slipped his hand over mine its i will

a nervous laugh bubbled up you will huh

his fingers brushed my cheek then slid into my hair i will

hope frank grumbled id rather have a few good weasels

it is difficult to say what is impossible for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow

being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope as long as despair could be postponed

your guardian angel never ever stops communicating with you

i feel that at times they should be frustrated with us but they seem to have endless patience and they never ever give up on us

let there be room left in your heart for the unimaginable  serendipity has a way of showing itself just when you feel like giving up

a great battle is a terrible thing the old knight said but in the midst of blood and carnage there is sometimes also beauty beauty that could break your heart

your hope is the most beautiful and the saddest in the world

we are mosaics  pieces of light love history stars  glued together with magic and music and words

tomorrow you promise yourself things will be different yet tomorrow is too often a repetition of today and you disappoint yourself again and again

i have hope for you if only because youre the only one left to hope for

in an age of hope men looked up at the night sky and saw the heavens in an age of hopelessness they call it simply space

as long as theres life theres hope

for what its worth its never too late to be whoever you want to be i hope you live a life youre proud of and if you find youre not i hope you have the strength to start over again

we truly believed in something back then and we knew we were the kind of people capable of believing in something  with all our hearts and that kind of hope will never simply vanish

love is only one fine star away

failure is a greater teacher than success

there is hope in forgiveness

anything seems possible at night when the rest of the world has gone to sleep

man can live about forty days without food about three days without water about eight minutes without airbut only for one second without hope

true hope is swift and flies with swallows wings

and as i watched him i knew that in every dark night there was somewhere a small light burning that could never be quenched

can i join you at lunch

she paused you have every other day

he laughed a sound as musical as the chiming song of the lupine fey when they ran yes but you resented it every other day

what makes you think i wont resent it today

hope its what i live on

one of the gravestones in the cemetery near the earliest church has an anchor on it and an hourglass and the words in hope

in hope why did they put that above a dead person was it the corpse hoping or those still alive

i was in love with everything i wanted to look with love at the angry people so that their eyes would be forced to respond and i wanted to bring gifts to the envious and tell them that i am worthless

fair as the moon and joyful as the light

tot wan with waiting not with sorrow dim not as she is but was when hope shone bright

not as she is but as she fills his dreams

self discovery is the most empowering time of your life you remember who you are and you become the best version of yourself but what they forget to tell you is to get to a point of pleasure you must face the pain

emma laughed darkly its a completely mad idea i know but my brain is a hopemaking engine

im so glad i said mine is a worstcasescenario generator

we need each other then

yes but we already knew that i think

i show my scars so that others know they can heal

with the need for the self in the time of another  i left my seaport grim and dear  knowing good work could be made  in the state governed by both hope and despair

stink bugs are temporary

i plead with younever ever give up on hope never doubt never tire and never become discouraged be not afraid

what hurts so bad about youth isnt the actual butt whippings the world delivers its the stupid hopes playacting like certainties

you make the rest of the beautiful things in the world cry for even trying at all you make it hard for me to breathe

all cannot be lost when there is still so much being found

i find peace when im confused i find hope when im let down not in me but in you

god grant me the courage not to give up what i think is right even though i think it is hopeless

she needed the chaos within her in order to discover the extraordinary no man could ever reach

and when all your faith is gone let it be me if its a friend you need let it be me

youll be okay no matter what shape reality takes you can handle it

no one knows for sure that that tomorrow wont come

but most people assume that tomorrow will still exist as usual

this is tobas paradox which means hope overcomes doubt

i wonder how youre supposed to know the exact moment when theres no more hope

we can be friends we can be anything we want to be

i want to reconcile the violence in your heart

i want to recognize your beautys not just a mask

i want to exorcise the demons from your past

i want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart

behind the veil of each night there is a smiling dawn

i have spoken words of hope but only of hope hope is not victory

god there must be a meaning fiercely he was certain that there must be a meaning

surely while we live we are not lost

oh janos janos my brother

surely we are not lostwhile we live

the restless spirit never loses its wings if sometimes it cannot fly it is because during those moments the sky vanishes

that was their way their heathenish hope deep in their hearts they remembered hell

im beginning to think that to hope isnt the same as to expect something to hope is to believe that life is an acceptable chaos

become your own soulmate then youll always have someone watching your back and youll always have someone who loves you

happiness will grow if you plant the seeds of love in the garden of hope with compassion and care

from this point forward you don’t even know how to quit in life

so odd a pair she and he a duet in code and electron age and youth and cynicism and hope

he is quicker than her  more learned by far but she she is unafraid too young to know failure and the fear it brings she takes him places he would not have explored by himself

she is catalyst she is chaos i can see why he loves her

why does a human body become deceased

the reason is that as long as the human body is not free from suffering mind cannot be happy

if a man lacks enthusiasm either his body or mind is in a deceased condition

now what saps the enthusiasm in man

if there is no enthusiasm life becomes drudgery  a mere burden to be dragged nothing can be achieved if there is no enthusiasm

the main reason for this lack of enthusiasm on the part of a man is that an individual looses the hope of getting an opportunity to elevate himself

hopelessness leads to lack of enthusiasm

the mind in such cases becomes deceased

when is enthusiasm created

when one breaths an atmosphere where one is sure of getting the legitimate reward for ones labor only then one feels enriched by enthusiasm and inspiration

sierra felt full of hope and confidence in god she knew who she was and she knew whose she was

you can tell people of the need to struggle but when the powerless start to see that they really can make a difference nothing can quench the fire

people who are too optimistic seem annoying this is an unfortunate misinterpretation of what an optimist really is

an idealist focuses only on the best aspects of all things sometimes in detriment to reality an optimist strives to find an effective solution a pessimist sees limited or no choices in dark times an optimist makes choices

when bobbing for apples an idealist endlessly reaches for the best apple a pessimist settles for the first one within reach while an optimist drains the barrel fishes out all the apples and makes pie

annoying yes but ohso tasty

the only hope for the doomed is no hope at all

its dark and i’m reading my scars because our moments remind me of where i should be

unity is a great thing and a great slogan but what the workers’ cause needs is the unity of marxists not unity between marxists and opponents and distorters of marxism

if you lose all hope you can always find it again

life isnt just about darkness or light rather its about finding light within the darkness

when it is dark enough you can see the stars

belief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul unbelief in denying them

if you hit bottom theres a whole lot of people here to help you up

the cruelest thing you can do to a person whos living in panic is to offer him or her hope that turns out false when the crash comes its intolerable

men and women are not limited by the place of their birth not by color of their skin but by the size of their hope

in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty

behind us the man laughed looks like we arent the only ones looking for a little diversion theres an empty office right over there guys

marsten raised his hand in thanks the couple moved on i let the kiss continue for five more seconds then pulled away

theyre gone i said

marsten frowned as if surprisedand disappointedthat id noticed i tugged my hair from his hands

okay coast clear i said lets go

he let out a small laugh i see i need to brush up on my kissing

no you have that down pat

she says with all the excitement of a teacher grading a math quiz

aplus now lets move before someone else comes along

to hope under the most extreme circumstances is an act of defiance that permits a person to live his life on his own terms it is part of the human spirit to endure and give a miracle a chance to happen

we know the battle ahead will be long but always remember that no matter what obstacles stand in our way nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change

we have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynicsthey will only grow louder and more dissonant  weve been asked to pause for a reality check weve been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope

but in the unlikely story that is america there has never been anything false about hope

hope can be everlasting

therefore do not give up hope

even in the sunset of your life

life isnt all grand but it isnt all miserable either  theres both sweet and sour in every day  so why focus on the ugly when you can gaze at whats beautiful  concentrate on the good

and i sometimes think that a moment of touching is the difference between complete utter despair and the ability to carry on

i like the immaterial world i like to live among thoughts and images of the past and the possible and even of the impossible now and then

with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible matthew

if youre reading this i hope god opens incredible doors for your life this year greatness is upon you you must believe it though

she knew then that white was more than a color it was a cold pale shade of understanding that seems to take all of your hope away

always it’s springand everyone’s in love and flowers pick themselves

hope for the best prepare for the worst

beware how you take away hope from another human being

concerned but not consumed

the voyager

we are all lonely voyagers sailing on lifes ebb tide

to a far off place were all stripling warriors have died

sometime at eve when the tide is low

the voices call us back to the rippling waters flow

even though our boat sailed with love in our hearts

neither our dreams or plans would keep heaven far apart

we drift through the hush of gods twilight pale

with no response to our friendly hail

we raise our sails and search for majestic light

while finding company on this journey to the brighten our night

then suddenly he pulls us through the reefs cutting sea

back to the place that he asked us to be

friendly barges that were anchored so sweetly near

in silent sorrow they drop their salted tears

shall our soul be a feast of kelp and brine

the wasted tales of wishful time

are we a fish on a line lured with bait

is life the grind a heartless fate

suddenly hush said the wind from afar

have you not looked to the heavens and seen the new star

it danced on the abyss of the evening sky

the sparkle of heaven shining on high

its whisper echoed on the oceans spray

from the bow to the mast they heard him say

hope is above not found in the deep

i am alive in your memories and dreams when you sleep

i will greet you at sunset and with the moons evening smile

i will light your path home every last lonely mile

my friends have no fear my work was done well

in this life i broke the waves and rode the swell

i found faith in those that i called my crew

my love will be the compass that will see you through

so dont look for me on the oceans floor to find

ive never left the weathered docks of your loving mind

for i am in the moon the wind and the whales evening song

i am the sailor of eternity whose voyage is not gone

what can i say about life do i praise it for letting you live or damn it for allowing the rest

hope means you keep on holding to things that wont ever be so again and so you bleed an inch at a time until theres nothing left

at the end of the day i went to this place where your memories left footsteps on my skin and the breath of your touch stained my desire yea it was one of those nights where i needed you the most

false hope is a terrible thing if its the only thing keeping you alive youll be dead by dawn

all my old loves will be returned to me

there is hope in dreams imagination and in the courage of those who wish to make those dreams a reality

i dont buy idea of second chance

with hope we make a lot of chances

things doesnt always start out the way we want them to its how they end thats important

stability was overrated crises and adventures on the other hand could actually teach you something

now hollow fires burn out to black

and lights are fluttering low

square your shoulders lift your pack

and leave your friends and go

o never fear lads naught’s to dread

look not left nor right

in all the endless road you tread

there’s nothing but the night

i’ve learned that no matter how inspired fired up and motivated you might be the dark clouds will always set in

he will not succeed in this taran said somehow we must find a way to escape we dare not lose hope

i agree absolutely fflewddur answered your general idea is excellent its only the details that are lacking

you will meet many opponents in your time that will come face to face with your flaws trust the chaos  pain  confusion is the pathway to break open and become free

i have found there to be little distance between the unlatching of a chain and the spreading of a woman’s legs as if they can never unbar only a single entrance it’s a disease called hope women suffer from it greatly

but a sanguine temper though for ever expecting more good than occurs does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression it soon flies over the present failure and begins to hope again

true friends dont come with conditions

i try to be rational and suppress the hope that this is for real but hope has a way of closing its eyes to reason and it just keeps growing

your mother sets you up blind dates with guys like that the corners of his mouth twitched she doesnt like you very much does she

but no matter how much evil i see i think it’s important for everyone to understand that there is much more light than darkness

i look in the mirror through the eyes of the child that was me

for every bad thing in life there are more good things to tip the balance

with all honesty somewhere between the hello and the dreams i saw you in i fell in love

you can break a man with hope

the fruit of empty hopes is more bitter than the saddest truth

she wasnt broken she was just bent over the chance of being ignored by the one she loved

the coming of light

even this late it happens

the coming of love the coming of light

you wake and the candles are lit as if by themselves

stars gather dreams pour into your pillows

sending up warm bouquets of air

even this late the bones of the body shine

and tomorrow’s dust flares into breath

i drink cup of sunlight every morning to brighten myself

all things even the deepest sorrow or the most profound happiness are all temporary hope is fuel for the soul without hope forward motion ceases

the world is round and the place which may seem like the end may also be only the beginning

a mouth of no distinction but well practiced before i entered my teens in irony for what is irony but the repository of hurt and what is hurt but the repository of hope

a loss of any kind is horrible not because it takes away but because it makes you believe in newspapers in tomatoes in empty whiskey bottles

books are precious things but more than that they are the strong backbone of civilization they are the thread upon which it all hangs and they can save us when all else is lost

denial it’s the only thing that keeps most of us from losing our sanity

grace will follow us even when we are going the wrong way

no one needed to say it but the room overflowed with that sort of blessing the combination of loss and abundance the abundance that has no guilt the loss that has no fix the simple tiredness that is not weary the hope not built on blindness

might is there any opiate more powerful than that word

hope could betray you—but if you had no hope life could actually

surprise you in the best of ways

he never had any real hope in the affair from the beginningbut being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hopeas long as despair could be postponed

great hope has no real footing unless one is willing to face into the doom that may also be on the way

never give up where theres life theres hope

but we believe – nay lord we only hope

that one day we shall thank thee perfectly

for pain and hope and all that led or drove

us back into the bosom of thy love

i guess this is a message for those of you who contemplate permanent solutions to temporary problems you never know what could be coming in the future there is so much music youve yet to hear

loss is only temporary when you believe in god

above all shadows rides the sun

and stars for ever dwell

i will not say the day is done

nor bid the stars farewell

but hope is no less realistic than despair it is still our choice whether to live in light or lie down in darkness

hope will lie to you but lust is what it is it never lies

i know too well how dangerous hope can be how it grows and sometimes dies taking its host with it its more powerful than anything drfibs keeps in his labs more precious than all the secrets inside sublevel two

it is by choice and not by chances that we change our circumstances

summertime it was a song it was a season i wondered if that season would ever live inside of me

the greatest joys in life are found not only in what we do and feel but also in our quiet hopes and labors for others

dont put off happiness you can have today tomorrow is a hope not a promise

i think hope is the worst thing in the world i really do it makes a fool of you while it lasts and then when its gone its like theres nothing left of you at all    except what you cant be rid of

you are only a prisoner when you surrender

i race to the square crossing it looking all around listening out

no

no

it’s empty

viola’s breathing heavy in my arms

and haven is empty

i reach the middle of the square

i don’t see nor hear a soul

i spin around again

but there’s no one

haven’s completely empty

there ain’t hope here after all

what we have at the moment isnt as the old liturgies used to say the sure and certain hope of the resurrection of the dead but a vague and fuzzy optimism that somehow things may work out in the end

and hope is like lovea ridiculous wonderful powerful thing

failure is just another way to learn how to do something right

suddenly i remembered that laugh it told a different story our story

and indeed it could be said that once the faintest stirring of hope became possible the dominion of plague was ended

there was no hope in death only an end

if you are seeking seek us with joy

for we live in the kingdom of joy

do not give your heart to anything else

but to the love of those who are clear joy

do not stray into the neighborhood of despair

for there are hopes they are real they exist –

do not go in the direction of darkness –

i tell you suns exist

brooklyn was a dream all the things that happened there just couldnt happen it was all dream stuff or was it all real and true and was it that she francie was the dreamer

i hope suffering dont exist

i think i should get love inked on my skin

maybe thats the only way i am destined to keep it

bond is stronger than blood the family grows stronger by bond

hope holds you fast like an anchor so you dont give way

great losses are great lessons

perhaps a wish was just a hope with better aim

to be truly radical is to make hope possible rather than despair convincing

bursts of hope make despair harder to live with

to be unbroken what would that be

if words that were spoken had not shattered me

and the quiet singing voice of the rose the song that promised all might be well all might be well that all manner of things might be well

it is better to dwell on the beautiful things in life than the negative

all beautiful distractions ignites from you

maybe what this is what we have is something that will save us from ourselves

may be its mine badluck

or yours not to get me

but i still have hope

of being yours

hope is for people who cant see the truth

the way i see it hard times arent only about money

or drought

or dust

hard times are about losing spirit

and hope

and what happens when dreams dry up

sometimes that

which we fear

strengthens our

spirit and gives

my sense of the holy is bound up with the hope that some day my remote descendants will live in a global civilization in which love is pretty much the only law

and now we step to the rhythm of miracles

from the light that never dies

for a flicker of a moment i imagined a world completely different from the one id always known a world in which i was treated with fairness even kindness a world in which fathers didnt sell their daughters

trust to some was placing all your insecurities and beliefs in one single person and hoping he or she wouldn’t squash them

when all else is lost the future still remains

there is magic in this sad hard world a magic stronger than fate stronger than chance and it is seen in the unlikeliest of places

by a hearth at night as girl leaves a bit of cheese for a hungry mouse

in a slaughter yard as the old and infirm the weak and discarded are made to matter more than money

in a poor carpenters small attic room where three sisters learned that the price of forgiveness is forgiving

and now on a battlefield as a mere girl tries to turn the red tide of war

it is the magic of a frail and fallible creature one capable of both unspeakable cruelty and immense kindness it lives inside every human being ready to redeem us to transform us to save us if we can only find the courage to listen to it

it is the magic of the human heart

hope is the most evil of all emotions

hope combined with action is the only thing that will bring you contentment

reality is hope and despair lie in the same places

and theyre just a matter of perspective

what changed my perspective was her

what can you do how much can you give to bring grace and salvation unto even one soul

what was it about not knowing a person that allowed you to wonder whether she might be the answer to all your problems

in a feast of fame and talks

scandal flashing raising tongue and brows

in a blast of bombing and power play

fear and death dig more revenge

famine and drought devour lives

in an unfortunate eye of a rebelling weather

crashing homes leaving many in devastation and desperation

in a country shaking with violence

innocent victims cry for justice and peace

in a home shaking with turmoil

humble patient hiding voice wants to be heard

to belong in this world

constantly changing decaying or improving

but felt in a slow long run

after all tomorrow is another day

love meant hope without love life held no promise

pray like it all depends on god but work like it all depends on you

history says don’t hope

on this side of the grave

but then once in a lifetime

the longedfor tidal wave

of justice can rise up

and hope and history rhyme

she cannot chain my soul yes she could hurt me shed already done soi would bleed or not scar or not live or not but she could not hurt my soul not unless i gave it to her

hope in the beginning feels like such a violation of the loss and yet without it we couldnt survive

rien ne va arrêter ma quête pour te trouver no one will stop my quest to find you

lifelines arent lines at all they are more like circles

its safe to start anywhere and the story will curve its way back to the starting point eventually

in other words it doesnt matter where i begin it doesnt change the end

maybe if you cant get someone out of your head they were never meant to leave perhaps they were meant to help change you into the person you have been waiting to become

even in darkness it is possible to create light and encourage compassion that it is possible to feel free inside a prison that even in exile friendship exists and can become an anchor that one instant before dying man is still immortal

joy is but the sign that creative emotion is fulfilling its purpose

this is what it means to live on when granted hope a person uses it as fuel as a guidepost to life it is impossible to live without hope

im pretty much looking for beauty all the time it just seems like some days the light is better to see it

you are happy when you are enthusiastic and actionoriented not when you are luxury and pleasure oriented

hope is the heartbeat of the soul

hope isnt destiny left passive its nothing more than disappointment deferred

i thought that the lighthouse looked lovely as hope

that star on lifes tremulous ocean

even if things arent going the way we want right now we will always get through it

dont you miss it i say being free

he laughs

i wear a necklace of hope with pearly beads when i met you it broke and the beads spilled all over the floor into the gutters

never mind those failures till yesterday each new day is a sequel of a wonderful life gifted with hopes to succeed

letter to his wife natalia sedova

mikey held tightly on to this shining truth as he and the golem sunk into the earth then with all the force of his heart his mind and his soul mikey mcgill began to dig

believe that you can make your way or dont either way you are right

a person whose head is bowed and whose eyes are heavy cannot look at the light

horses change lives they give out young people confidence and selfesteem they provide peace and tranquility to troubled souls they give us hope

it has been said that life has treated me harshly and sometimes i have complained in my heart because many pleasures of human experience have been withheld from me…if much has been denied me much very much has been given me…

time works so hard for us if only we can let it

i felt as if i were riding a pendulum just as i would swing into the abyss of hopelessness the pendulum would swing back with some small goodness

easily mistaken it is not about a love for adversity it is about knowing a strength and a faith so great that adversity in all its adverse manifestations hardly even exists

how i wish i was like the water

flowing so freely with every drop

let my every emotion wonder

no need to start nor even stop

how i wish i was like the fire

burning with every flame up

as a phoenix raises its wings up

how i wish i was like the earth

raising each flower from the ground

seeing the beauty of death and birth

and then returning to the ground

how i wish i was like the wind

hearing each whisper sound and thought

a lonesome and wandering little wind

shattering all that has been sought

oh how i wish i was where you are

not separated by empty space so far

it seems like were galaxies apart

but we find hope within our heart

and how i wish i was all of the above

so i can come below and yet forget

the beauty of angels which come down like a dove

and demons who love with no regret

part of her revolted against the insanity of the rules part of her was grateful in a world of chaos any guidelines helped and she knew that each day she remained alive she remained alive one plus one plus one the devils arithmetic

if you had hope maybe you could find a way to make things change because if you thought about it there were so many reasons to try

where there is a key there is yet hope

the universe never complains

when youre wrong or right

she always loves and cares

she always gives and shares

when you get lost she becomes the light

helps you to find what is right

but she never forgets

to show you the light

i kept loving and loving and loving every waking hour i marveled on how these moments would make made me feel i wanted to love the world and be the change it so deliciously craved

every beginner possesses a great potential to be an expert in his or her chosen field

to believe and yet to have no hope is to thirst beside a fountain

perhaps what matters when all is said and done is not who puts us down but who picks us up

without being push to the wall we will have remained in our comfortable zone but this circumstance challenges us to find the courage to move on

it was just like him she thought with him a happy ending was always a foregone conclusion but such was the power of his faith that when she was with him she found herself believing in happy endings too

every adversity brings new experiences and new lessons

the courage is light of one’s life

is the beauty of today

the hope of one’s soul

is the promise of a tomorrow

the times of our past

is a wisdom for anytime

the labour of our sacrifice and love

is a masterpiece of our moments

the voyage of one’s mind

is a journey towards discovery

the joy in one’s heart

is a gift for everyone

the faith of a soul

is a key to hope and to love

the true unconditional love of a heart

is a priceless treasure one can ever give

for our mind heart and soul

in any journey of rise or fall

let faith hope and love breathe

as you share it for whom your heart beats

the point is you have family and friends who love you you have a world out there just waiting for you to conquer it you have a life that will be anything you make it thats the point

excuse me i feel interrupted and i think ive overdose from the idea of loving you

though its cold and lonely in the deep dark night i can see paradise by the dashboard light

a winner is not someone who wins its someone who tries and isnt afraid to lose

he who plants a tree plants a hope

love mercy and grace sisters all attend your wounds of silence and hope

you were standing in the wake of devastation

and you were waiting on the edge of the unknown

and with the cataclysm raining down

insides crying save me now

you were there impossibly alone

the world is a goddamned evil place the strong prey on the weak the rich on the poor i’ve given up hope that there is a god that will save us all how am i supposed to believe that there’s a heaven and a hell when all i see now is hell

a thousand desperate wishes have been spoken on these shores and in the end they were all the same make me someone new

despair is a free man—hope is a slave

just above our terror the stars painted this story

in perfect silver calligraphy and our souls too often

abused by ignorance covered our eyes with mercy

this world’s anguish is no different

from the love we insist on holding back

miracles were just second chances if you really thought about itsecond chances when all hope was lost

broken hearts you can run you can hide and perhaps the earth is big enough to believe you’re safe so maybe for a moment you have escaped but hear me hear me well love will find you and it will leave nothing behind

in all my wanderings through this world of care

in all my griefs  and god has given my share

i still had hopes my latest hours to crown

amidst these humble bowers to lay me down

to husband out lifes taper at the close

and keep the flame from wasting by repose

i still had hopes for pride attends us still

amidst the swains to show my booklearnd skill

around my fire an evening group to draw

and tell of all i felt and all i saw

and as a hare whom hounds and horns pursue

pants to the place from whence at first she flew

i still had hopes my long vexations past

here to return  and die at home at last

everything happens for a reason just be patient

its true i live on hope why shouldnt i every day i see her beauty while you rot in hell you will tell me that im deluded but we are all deluded in some way the question is which is the best delusion

they want us to be afraid

they want us to be afraid of leaving our homes

they want us to barricade our doors

and hide our children

their aim is to make us fear life itself

they want us to hate

they want us to hate the other

they want us to practice aggression

and perfect antagonism

their aim is to divide us all

they want us to be inhuman

they want us to throw out our kindness

they want us to bury our love

and burn our hope

their aim is to take all our light

they think their bricked walls

will separate us

they think their damned bombs

will defeat us

they are so ignorant they don’t understand

that my soul and your soul are old friends

they are so ignorant they don’t understand

that when they cut you i bleed

they are so ignorant they don’t understand

that we will never be afraid

we will never hate

and we will never be silent

for life is ours

the moon is the reflection of your heart and moonlight is the twinkle of your love

his gut was stitched up good and tight but that didn’t prevent it from flopping he wiped his damp palms on the legs of his jeans and stood up shakily leaning heavily on his cane

he called himself a masochist for putting himself through this torture day after day

he braced himself for the disappointment of having to go home alone

he braced himself for happiness like he’d never known in his entire life

he watched the door they would come through

fear not the unknown it is a sea of possibilities

hope was but a timid friend

she sat without the grated den

watching how my fate would tend

she was cruel in her fear

through the bars one dreary day

i looked out to see her there

and she turned her face away

still in strife she whispered peace

she would sing while i was weeping

if i listened she would cease

false she was and unrelenting

when my last joys strewed the ground

those sad relics scattered round

balm to all my frenzied pain

stretched her wings and soared to heaven

went and neer returned again

no star is ever lost we once have seen

we always may be what we might have been

since good though only thought

has life and breath

gods life  can always be redeemed from death

and evil in its nature is decay

and any hour may blot it all away

the hope that lost in some far distance seems

may be the truer life and this the dream

in a more golden light

each little doubt and fear

each little discord here

you put a new heart in emma a long time ago it just wasn’t the kind you were thinking of he laughed to himself hope is an amazing thing i saw it in emma saw it with my own eyes

the visions we offer our children shape the future it matters what those visions are often they become selffulfilling prophecies dreams are maps

here the whole world stars water air

and field and forest as they were

like cast off clothes was left behind

in ashes yet with hopes that she

reborn from holy poverty

resume them on her easter day

i am hopeful though not full of hope and the only reason i dont believe in happy endings is because i dont believe in endings

for our people butterflies are a symbol of hope its said that if you capture one in your hands and whisper your dreams to it it will carry them up to the heavens so that the wish can be granted

be a craftsman in speech that thou mayest be strong for the strength of one is the tongue and speech is mightier than all fighting

if the fire in your heart is strong enough it will burn away any obstacles that come your way

stooping very low he engraves with care

his name indelible upon our dust

and from the ashes of our selfdespair

kindles a flame of hope and humble trust

he seeks no second site on which to build

but on the old foundation stone by stone

cementing sad experience with grace

fashions a stronger temple of his own

the day will bring hope for me said aragorn is it not said that no foe has ever taken the hornburg if men defended it

so the minstrels say said éomer

then let us defend it and hope

heres a funny question

what is your favorite word

think about it—maybe its a word that makes you absolutely happy or a word that sounds gloriously beautiful or a word that evokes awe and wonder maybe you are reminded of a great time when you hear it or maybe it represents your lifes dream

so what is it what is your favorite word of all words

thought about it yet

and now think why

heres another poem

like all others before and after

dedicated to you

there isnt anything left to be said

but i will spend my life

trying to put you into words

you who is every goodness

and hope

your love is a better fate for me

than anything i could wish for

if you are a part of me

then you’re the best part

and if youre separate from me

then you are my destination

but i’ve become a weary traveller

so please

let us never be apart

he cursed himself for having assumed the weather would be sunny perhaps it was the result of evolution he thoughtsome adaptive gene that allowed the english to go on making blithe outdoor plans in the face of almost certain rain

hope knows no fear

hope dares to blossom even inside the abysmal abyss

hope secretly feeds and strengthens promise

it is the privilege of the rich

to waste the time of the poor

to water with tears in secret

a tree that grows in secret

that bears fruit in secret

that ripened falls to the ground in secret

and manures the parent tree

oh the wicked tree of hatred and the secret

the sap rising and the tears falling

a man is a fool to live in hopes of a better tomorrow i have a thousand better ways today to spend what time remains ahead of me and i have brighter lighter and more pleasant places in which to spend it

do you know where your breakthrough begins your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends

somewhere fate laughs in her faroff country because now i am the human and it is grace i will lose again and again immer wieder always the same every winter losing more of her each year unless i find a cure

once a day has begun eventfully it generally carries on being every bit as lively

every dawn of our lives a heart is forged and

linked with lore to one so similar

born with blessed life dust

stored beneath its soul

to bless and pass onto its children

even though the wind may blow it all away

dont ever worry cos im your friend

do you believe theres hope at the end i ask

no she says simply looking away no i dont but im still going she eyes me you coming with

and when the dawn comes creeping in

myself to watch the daylight win

i’ve always seen this in you ever since you were a little girl — this hunger to love other people into their highest selves and it’s what has made me irreversibly and just so forever in love with you

unforgiveness denies the victim the possibility of parole and leaves them stuck in the prison of what was incarcerating them in their trauma and relinquishing the chance to escape beyond the pain

hope is faith holding out its hand in the dark

to say goodbye is to die a little

to say good morning is a hope for a new sunshine in a cloudy winter

i know now just quite how

my life and love might still go on

in your heart in your mind

ill stay with you for all of time

love as a concrete foundation for an authentically functional civilization requires the aroundtheclock labors of forgiveness without it love fails friendship fails intelligence fails humanity fails

here is little habit that can make a big difference send sunbeams intentionally send a word of encouragement or appreciation every day to one person

with no positivity there is no hope with no negativity there is no improvement

we have such numerous interests in our lives that it is not uncommon on a single occasion for the foundations of a happiness that does not yet exist to be laid down alongside the intensification of a grief from which we are still suffering

share your love share you happiness care for others your wealth will be endless

the secret of happiness is love and secret of love is nonjudgmental care

hope is bulletproof truth just hard to hit

similar to a butterfly ive gone through a metamorphosis been released from my dark cocoon embraced my wings and soared

look up

try again you have millions of alternatives fill yourself with the bullets of hope and you will kill failure with one shot

i neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity dreaming or magic but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost

human life is under the absolute dominion of two mighty principles fear and hope and that any one who can make these serve his ends may be sure of rapid fortune

hope may have a positive reputation but it has a vicious downside if you have hope you can be crushed

what are you planting today to harvest tomorrow

chapters  life has many different chapters for us one bad chapter doesn’t mean the end of the book

what did i tell you somethings happening cried sam the wars going well said shagrat but gorbag he wasnt so sure and he was right there too things are looking up mr frodo havent you got some hope now

well no not much sam frodo sighed thats away beyond the mountains were going east not west and im so tired and the ring is so heavy sam and i begin to see it in my mind all the time like a great wheel of fire

if the affluent cannot afford hope you cannot expect the destitute to pay for desperation

it sounded like walls tumbling liberty bells chiming government buildings being stormed

it sounded like a revolution

it sounded like hope

i dont know when the boys

began to walk away with parts of myself

in their sticky hands when loving

became a process of subtraction or why

having given up what seems so much

im willing to lose even more — erasing

all this bodys known relearning it with you

as we sail in the voyage of life

the love and joy we shared count more than anything else

let them feel the rhythm of our heart

share them the music of our soul

for a meaningful fulfilling moments of today

for a hopeful promising and joyful tomorrow

wherever theres hope theres a trial

any fool can hope when success lies plainly in view it wants genuine strength to hope when matters are hopeless

so young to die

no no not i

i love the warm sunny skies

i want no war no battle cry

no no not i

in a world plagued with commonplace tragedies only one thing exists that truly has the power to save lives and that is love

i challenge you to make your life the masterpiece you want to paint the novel you want to read the day you want to wake to

the door replied maimie will always always be open and mother will always be waiting at it for me

hope and reality lie in inverse proportions inside the walls of a hospital doubt is like dye once is spreads into the fabric of excuses youve woven youll never get rid of the stain

she was famous and she was insane

her voice soared out over the audience holding them spellbound and enraptured delivering their hopes and fears tangled in chords and rhythm they called her an angel her voice a gift

she was famous and she was a liar

believe on the lord jesus christ and you will be saved

you wont find the truth of life in morbidity only in hope

the rest of our life is going to be the best of our life

oh no i said because if our life is just one endless song about hope and regret then oh no is apparently that songs chorus the words we always return to

sorry for what

for shouting at you its just that when i think about the future i keep panicking its like falling from the top of the stairs in the dark not knowing where ill end up

he put his arm around my shoulders i understand life is precarious for most of us but more so for you what you forget is what most of your friends see in you

whats that

the ability to beat the odds

and fall on my feet

he nodded

i just hope that lasts

it will catkin it will it wouldnt dare fail you

we may be helpless to stop bad things from happening but perhaps god leaves us signs and road maps to help us recover and reconnect provided we know where to look

hope and desire

all unfulfilled

have more than rope

and hangman killed

that would be the death of anyone  to recognize false hopes with a certainty one mustnt know that if it is offered refuse

hope is a journey

into an enchanted tomorrow

live for the lovers not the haters

do we ever have to abandon all hope is it not perhaps a good thing that by refusing to give in to the evidence the dreams that lie half awake in us all may persist

hope is a seed that grows inside us from the moment we are born

mile by mile its a trial yard by yard its hard but inch by inch its a cinch

hope is a flicker a candle flame kept burning by the simple act of breathing

have faith in your beliefs

when i woke up in a pool of sweat i couldnt remember a thing maddy had said

flowers dont tell they show thats the way good books should be toostephanie skeem author of flotsam

for hours they stared relentlessly at the scarlet ribbon on the map and hated it because it would not move up high enough to encompass the city

in the middle of the night yossarian knocked on wood crossed his fingers and tiptoed out of his tent to move the bomb line up over bologna

not i’ll not carrion comfort despair not feast on thee

not untwist—slack they may be—these last strands of man

in me ór most weary cry i can no more i can

can something hope wish day come not choose not to be

do try to remember this even the worlds not so black as it is painted

valerie to stephen pg

i had a dream when i was  that someday i would go to the region of ice and snow and go on and on till i came to one of the poles of the earth

for if the darkness and corruption leave

a vestige of the thoughts that once i had

better by far you should forget and smile

than that you should remember and be sad

laughter with those that understand us is music for the soul

a hug at the right moment and a kind shoulder to lean on

is the sprinkle of magic that keeps us walking towards hope

hope could not outlast the breather love however    love was something not even death could conquer because at the end of everything even life he was hers

time goes by time comes along

all is old and all is new

what is right and what is wrong

you must think and ask of you

have no hope and have no fear

waves that rise can never hold

if they urge or if they cheer

you remain aloof and cold

to our sight a lot will glisten

many sounds will reach our ear

who could take the time to listen

and remember all we hear

keep aside from all that patter

seek yourself far from the throng

when with loud and idle clatter

time goes by time comes along

nor forget the tongue of reason

or its even scales depress

when the moment changing season

wears the mask of happiness

it is born of reasons slumber

and may last a wink as true

for the one who knows its number

all is old and all is new

be as to a play spectator

as the world unfolds before

you will know the heart of matter

should they act two parts or four

when they cry or tear asunder

from your seat enjoy along

and youll learn from art to wonder

what is right and what is wrong

past and future ever blending

are the twin sides of same page

new start will begin with ending

when you know to learn from age

all that was or be tomorrow

we have in the present too

but whats vain and futile sorrow

you must think and ask of you

for the living cannot sever

from the means weve always had

now as years ago and ever

men are happy or are sad

other masks same play repeated

diffrent tongues same words to hear

of your dreams so often cheated

have no hope and have no fear

hope not when the villains cluster

by success and glory drawn

fools with perfect lack of luster

will outshine hyperion

fear it not theyll push each other

to reach higher in the fold

do not side with them as brother

waves that rise can never hold

life attracts you into eddies

to change actors in the play

steal aside from crowd and bustle

do not look seem not to hear

from your path away from hustle

if they urge or if they cheer

if they reach for you go faster

hold your tongue when slanders yell

your advice they cannot master

dont you know their measure well

let them talk and let them chatter

let all go past young and old

unattached to man or matter

you remain aloof and cold

you remain aloof and cold

if they urge or if they cheer

waves that rise can never hold

have no hope and have no fear

you must think and ask of you

what is right and what is wrong

all is old and all is new

time goes by time comes along

the journey through another world beyond bad dreams

beyond the memories of a murdered generation

cartographed in captivity by bare survivors

makes sacristans of us all

the old ones go our bail we oblate preachers of our tribes

be careful they say dont hock the beads of

kinship agonies the moireeffect of unfamiliar hymns

upon our own a change in pitch or shrillness of the voice

transforms the ways of song to words of poetry or prose

and makes distinctions

no one recognizes

surrounded and absorbed we tread like etruscans

on the edge of useless law we pray

to the giver of prayer we give the cane whistle

in ceremony we swing the heavy silver chain

hope is some extraordinary spiritual grace that god gives us to control our fears not to oust them

hope can be imagined as a domino effect a chain reaction each increment making the next increase more feasible there are moments of fear and doubt that can deflate it

but if there was one thing that all my years as the spider all the battles all the brushes with my own death had taught me then it was this

that this was what was important this moment right now and all the ones that we are lucky enough to have after it today tomorrow hell maybe even forever

i suppose shes right its like a metaphor for life no one wants an ornery old goat but we cant resist opening the door ayway we cant keep from hoping

faith doesnt always come naturally but as we take those steps of faith we notice little by little that our faith has grown and it isnt as hard as we first thought

i couldnt help thinking that if i by pure chance had found a whole universe in a single unknown book buried in that endless necropolis tens of thousands more would remain unexplored forgotten forever

what lies ahead seems unlikely when it becomes the past it seems inevitable

my thoughts i think will soon be sound

my mind i hope will soon be found

i feel a resurgence of my yearold self… that little warrior goddess of a girl reminding me of who i was when i was little before the world got its hands on me

i know that this process of ‘me changing my life’ doesn’t just end once i set fire to this list of things i hate about myself tonight isn’t as much of a new beginning as it is a violent end and i know the real work hasn’t even started yet

i know the world is still out there and i know im not yet friendly to its pace but as long as i know him with me here there somewhere – us – i know i have a chance

i’m going to follow this invisible red thread until i find myself again… until i finally figure out… who i’m meant to be

never loose hope stay strong you never know what tomorrow brings

how does one kill fear i wonder how do you shoot a spectre through the heart slash off its spectral head take it by its spectral throat

the morning was full of sunlight and hope

she bewitches you trevanion said and she is yours for the taking any fool can see that so take her and get whatever needs to be gotten out of your system

i cared about them i wanted them to feel better to live better lives and then it occurred to me  i cared about myself i wanted me to live a better life too caring about myself was allowing me to care about others

we’re a couple of shooting stars biggs and we’ll never be stopped

the more details depth and thought you put into your ideas the more valuable they become

we hold our dreams and ideals close to our hearts where the promises are made to the future generations

when the world caves in

still my hope will cling

to your promise

where my courage ends

let my heart find strength

in your presence

you have to go head even if no one goes with you

love is my inner strength and my power

yes there is no good pretending it is hard to leave everything

three rules to obey

dont be overimpressed by your past glories

dont be scared by your future stories

be hopeful to get out of todays miseries

but only a person in the depths of despair neglected to look beyond winter to the spring that inevitably followed bringing back color and life and hope

disappointment had to be postponed hope kept alive as long as possible

he wore his hope like a winter coat layered over the top of all of him

the merchants of hope will never go out of business

to hope

how shall i lure thee to my haunts forlorn

for me wilt thou renew the wither’d rose

and clear my painful path of pointed thorn

ah come sweet nymph in smiles and softness drest

like the young hours that lead the tender year

enchantress come and charm my cares to rest—

alas the flatterer flies and will not hear

a prey to fear anxiety and pain

must i a sad existence still deplore

lo—the flowers fade but all the thorns remain

for me the vernal garland blooms no more

come then pale misery’s love be thou my cure

and i will bless thee who tho’ slow art sure

worry looks back hope looks forward but faith always looks up

dazzles the darkness in my heart

and breaks apart the dusky clouds of night

the end of all is hinted in the start

when we are born we bear the seeds of blight

around us life  death are torn apart

yet a great ring of pure and endless light

dazzles the darkness in my heart

it lights the world to my delight

infinity is present in each part

a loving smile contains all art

the motes of starlight spark  dart

infinity is present in each part

and a great ring of pure and endless light

dazzles the darkness in my heart

one who has hope lives differently

but thats just it i can either focus on what i have lost or what i have gained and i choose the latter

maybe the future is like rowing for shore your only choice is to try or give up

i kept reaching for my muses

my wandering muses floating

on clouds filled with their passions

its old very old i think made up long ago in our hills what my music teacher calls a mountain air but the words are easy and soothing promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today

she was a dreamer and a schemer  one didnt dream and scheme without hope

uncertainty is the refuge of hope

you can never run from your past it defines who you are today but use your awo given intelligence and enjoy the future…because that only comes once’ vaalbara the land of shadows

action is what makes hope a reality

i am forever grateful for not knowing—what would have been what will be holds none of those bittersweet pangs and it is lit w joy

when our dreams don’t come true sometimes we can hand them down to our children and hope that they will come true for them the joy can be immeasurable just the same

when hope disappears  faith steps in

i have no word of yours to assure me that our brief friendship held for you the same significance it held for me but i must go on believing so every hope of the future is meaningless unless i have faith that you and i will share it together

as i age in the world it will rise and spread

and be for this place horizon

and orison the voice of its winds

i have made myself a dream to dream

of its rising that has gentled my nights

let me desire and wish well the life

these trees may live when i

no longer rise in the mornings

to be pleased with the green of them

shining and their shadows on the ground

and the sound of the wind in them

hope was always out ahead of fact possibility obscured the outlines of reality

everything you do is connected to who you are as a person and in turn creates the person you are becoming everything you do affects those you love all of life is covenant

you do not get what you wish for unless it be known to the source of your desire

death is more merciful than hope itself there is nothing surprising in this for death is divinely appointed while hope is the creation of human folly both end in frustration am i destined to lead a life of endless frustration

the beginning and the end

the god i believe in believes in me and won’t silence my heart or others based on a paycheck at the end of the day

i really rarely meet someone with quality like this

has great expectation and persistent efforts to earn it

yet also had a high immunity against disappointment

hope how she had grown to hate the word it was an insideious seed planted inside a persons soul surviving covertly on little tending then flowering so spectacularly that none could help but cherish it

hope and faith underlie a promise

and love energizes men to realize it

in tough and desperate times when your creativity begs to be birthed loose the confines of the ground stand up in your faith and walk atop the waves…

god is writing his story on the pages of our lives

doubt is the ally of hope not its enemy and together they made all the blessing he had

the key is love

it is the gateway

to hope

to joy

to enhanced living

love is the answer

i hope limitless and its this limitless hope that pushes me forward to live this life

when in darknessstrike a match

i am planting a tree in this bomb crater to remind us that in the midst of death there is life and hope

how many fears came between us

earthquakes diseases wars where hell

from skies made of winged death

horror tore this world asunder

while inside the bleeding smoke

and beyond the shredded weeping flesh

from the history lesson

night always turns to day again as long as the sun shall rise so shall it be for darkened dreams grown pale from compromise

the idea of the future pregnant with an infinity of possibilities is thus more fruitful than the future itself and this is why we find more charm in hope than in possession in dreams than in reality

lighthouses my boy beacons of the future capsules with hundreds of bright little seeds in each out of which will spring the wiser better england of the future

if you wish success in life make perseverance you bosom friend experience your wise councellor caution your elder brother and hope your guardian genius

he couldn’t look back at the children he couldn’t think of it all he could do was watch the eyes of his wife

and even as the rustling began he felt still he felt calm scratching and scrapping within the stones and the rustle of wings but all eli knew was the nature of love

the strong lines of the womans

face bespoke hardwon wisdom and courage and somehow that made watching

her more difficult if such a woman could be defeated by elantris what hope was there for raoden

please dont take my wings

there is a great deal of ruin in a nation

faith without a measure of doubt aint worth a brass farthin

what if it rained or you felt a bit glandy it just wasnt practical better by far to simply try and be good and courageous and bold and to make a difference not change the world exactly but the bit around you

you can curse the moon

curse the day your’re born

but the pilot of your plane is you

we’re all in this world by a greater plan

look up lift your wings because you can

the light said the first song album

unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance

should the king in exile pretend he is happy there

should he not seek his own country

dear refuge of my weary soul

on thee when sorrows rise

on thee when waves of trouble roll

my fainting hope relies

hope is a straw hat hanging beside a window covered with frost

would that death were like this would that one would sleep and sleep and sleep forever

then hope unlookedfor came so suddenly to eomers heart and with it the bite of care and fear renewed that he said no more but turned and went swiftly from the hall

ezekial saw the wheel

way up in the middle of the air

o ezekial saw the wheel

way in the middle of the air

now the big wheel runs by faith

and the little wheel runs by the grace of god

if i were a character in one of my books id be the optimistic one believing the best and urging others to do the same

theres no guarantee of disasterfree in any world religion

but love faith and knowledge give men hope and willpower

but if you ask me what i remember about

i will say it was the year franklin d roosevelt died and i got one of his flowers

i will tell you that yellow rose give me the courage to do the right thing even if it was hard

i will say it was the time in my life when i learned all of us is fragile as a mimosa blossom

but the miracle of all is

when push comes to shove we can be just as tough as hickory

it mostly hurts at first after a while it starts to feel better

when you live forever and dont age it gives you time to hope

the best evil plan offers something much more for peoplea chance to buy into an idea that matters and share it with people who matter to them

i had learned that every patient has the right to hope despite long odds and it was my role to help nurture that hope

he cant have gone he said christ know he cant have gone hes making a turn maybe he has been hooked before and her remembers something of it the he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy

there i was waiting afraid i’d never experience the kind of joy yet to come but hoping for it just the same

but oh when gloomy doubts prevail

the springs of comfort seem to fail

and all my hopes decline

yet gracious god where shall i flee

thou art my only trust

and still my soul would cleave to thee

though prostrate in the dust

omniscience about life and death is not within a physicians purview a doctor should never write off a person a priori

hope had become despair protestors had become terrorists love had become sex music had become noise and us had become me

many are less fortunate than you’ may not be a roof to live under but it will serve to retire beneath in the event of a shower

impending doom it was a familiar sweater we all wore it and as scratchy as it felt against our skin we kept it on

we hope that we will live only because we must be with god as alive as he is

don’t hope you will receive help from the words of life because they all bring you to death

people die from lack of shared empathy and affinity by establishing social connectedness we give hope a chance and the other can become heaven  le ciel cest lautre

i had turned away from the picture and was going back to the world where events move men change light flickers life flows in a clear stream no matter whether over mud or over stones

i should have been bolder and kissed her at the end i should have been more cautious i had talked too much i had said too little

if youre jealous of someone else it simply means you have not come to a true acceptance and appreciation of yourself

embrace every new day with gratitude hope and love

after you hear and listen first must come desire second must come willingness

third should come understanding

fourth should come progression and with progression will come more understanding

you only feel powerless because your fear has given your power to the object of your fear once you realise this you can claim it back

i would fight every angel between us until god said yes

with god brokenness is nothing more than the stage upon which the impossible is about to happen

be open about your thoughts ideas and desires and you will be right with your decisions

do you have any idea how frightening it is to care for someone who dreams they infect you with their optimism and soon you start to dream together you begin to dare to hope

endure to the very end

im not singing for the future

im not dreaming of the past

im not talking of the fist time

i never think about the last

if one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child then one million of you are a million times guilty

great achievement requires personal force determined spirit and selfconfidence

i didnt know that ive completely left them all in the past theres a part of me wishing and hoping that she would come back for me and we would start a new life together but she didnt

you are too full of your own hopes to hold anyone elses

if one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty

life is about celebrating uniqueness diversity and then bringing it all together like the varied colors of a rainbow different yet connected

we cherish all the past we glide adown the present awake yet dreaming but the future of ours together—there the bird sings loudest and the sun shines always there

through christ the sting of death is but a gentle pinch to the soul and the mourn is light perhaps someday in that glorious place free of sin we shall meet again

no crime is a means to an end no crime can be rationalized

your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a selfillusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone

past and present i know well each is a friend and sometimes an enemy to me but it is the quiet beckoning future an absolute stranger with whom i have fallen madly in love

i know that your soul is on life support and that you feel lost and like you’re completely spinning out of control but you’re finding yourself — here tonight… even in this darkness

your personal truth is your gift to the world

you never know who youre inspiring or uninspiring people notice more than you think

hope is holding on to the promises of god

be thankful for a breath of fresh air to be alive and well allow love and happiness to penetrate throughout your mind and soul take time to relax and live in the moment the now the present enjoy today

maybe shes a slut because shes lonely shes sad shes hoping someone or something will make the lonely and sad go away

my mother is my friend

who shares with me her bread

all my hopelessness cured

her company makes me secured

pray each morning and each night

talk to god and be polite

tell him what youre grateful for

leave your troubles at his door

share your wishes needs and hopes

ask god how to bravely cope

tell him all you learned today

say the things you need to say

beg forgiveness for your sins

pray to live with him again

speak with earnest heart and soul

he will listen this i know

for prayer is hope put to the test

and hope is faith in what is best

faith is power to do great things

thus prayer is faiths enabling wings

the victory over our inner self is a daily struggle be strong and do not give up

let the love of the moon kiss you good night

let the morning sun wake you up with loving light

for those constantly full of joy they sometimes feel a little guilty for always feeling so good that guilt is compassion it flies in with an attempt to share ones joy with others who do not have it

i hope your heart feels better

i hope your mind is set right

i hope your love is connected to others and you dont feel so lost and locked up

i hope everything is okay for you

and by okay i mean greater than ever

nobody really cares if you’re miserable so you might as well be happy and make the most of where you are

don’t believe negative voices listen to the divineinstinct of awaken soul

and thats what love is i suppose the one thing that is most worth hoping for and the one thing thats most surprising when it lands because its better it exceeds hope makes hope nearsighted

the will to dream the courage to act and the hope to win are the stuffs that make life meaningful create the life you wish to live and live it fully

you can use the stumbling blocks to build your success

for a long time things were so bad very bad dark even when there was light

the only thing that kept the dark back was the forever shiny thing that was her secret

it is a wordthe word hangs on a silver chain the word is hope

between what i see in a field and what i see in another field

there passes for a moment the figure of a man

his steps go with him in the same reality

but i look at him and them and they’re two things

the man goes walking with his ideas false and foreign

and his steps go with the ancient system that makes legs walk

i see him from a distance without any opinion at all

how perfect that he is in him what he is — his body

his true reality which doesn’t have desires or hopes

but muscles and the sure and impersonal way of using them

the greatest obsession is i believe in myself

hope is just a feelingwill is the real thing

i am hopeful because love overflows from my heart gratitude for beauty and life leads my way

be strong

you deny them hope you are telling them that jesus loves them but not much

the music of hope is everywhere but to hear it you need to ignore the muddy jangle of lifes hassles

i threw my hands in the air and said show me something

he said if you dare come a little closer

youre all incredibly thoughtful souls who keep my head attached to my body

that’s the thing about love

it can take you up to the mountaintop and can drop you

and the impact will either kill you or make you a new person

we must seek together to address the good aspirations of people everywhere for we are bound together through great commonality

we are ready to despair too soon we are ready to say ‘what’s the good of doing anything’ hope is the virtue we should cultivate most in this present day and age

she felt the depth of her losses before they were realized and she wondered is there still hope did she even dare hold on to such a tenuous thing as hope

elizabeths barreness and advanced agea double symbol of hopelessnessbecame the means by which god would announce to the world that nothing is impossible for him

some way some how im going to be happy im going to laugh im going to prosperi feel good that i remain positive thru these mess up times

morning dew upon the grass

glistening in the sun

yesterday’s gone

but this day has begun

no rain cant get the rainbow

what we really need is only a heart of surrender  always trust what god has plan for our life so we do our best god shall take the rest thats what i called faith

even a single lamp dispels the deepest darkness

for though i walk through the valley of shadows of death i will never fear for you are in me and i know you will never let me go

and why is the sun such a bad companion

to the traveler in the desert

and why is the sun so congenial

in the hospital garden

hope is something that can never be taken from you unless you allow someone to take it if you never lose hope you will never truly be poor

a very small degree of hope is sufficient to cause the birth of love

yes in spite of all some shape of beauty moves away the pall from our dark spirits

in the middle of the night there is always less hope in the dawn of the morning there is always more hope

have you lost your hope have you remained inside the fog don’t worry even if you can’t find it a new hope will come and find you

hope is like a word made with cloud without faith it quickly blows away

take a chance change a no to a yestoday

your dreamers you ridiculous children you dancing grinning fuckups here is your bright future your earnest saccharine hope how does it taste dripping from the neck of everyone you love

lord help us root our feet to the earth

and our eyes to the road

and always remember the fallen angels

who attempting to soar

were seared instead by the sun and wings melting

came crashing back to the sea

lord help root my eyes to the earth

and stay my eyes to the road

so i may never stumble

psalm  from prayer and study the book of shhh

we all flee in hope of finding some ground of security

i could smack her punch her in the face but then i see what she cant hide from me ive seen it beforethe desperation the agony the need to find a reason to go on and the inability to find it

with every choice you create the life you’ll live with every decision you design it

its hard to stay committed when our heart isnt in it

if the bombs go off the sun will still be shining because ive heard it said that

every mushroom cloud has a silver lining

in the meantime i’ll

wish it upon a star michael cooper

each life experience poses this question how do you want to be changed because of me

a wise teacher learns in the midst of teaching a wise student teaches in the midst of learning

hope finds its fulfillment when nurtured through faith and shared with love

no gasp at a miracle that is truly miraculous because the magic lies in the fact that you knew it was there for you all along

sometimes memory is the only gift we give ourselves and the only hope we have of finding our way home

your tears are my prayers

when i touched that boy i felt something something awful something i can’t describe

we all felt it nick said

what if said nick not even sure what he was going to say yet what if you were that kid and you were told you could change the world but you would have to sacrifice yourself to do it

clarence chuckled at the thought i believe that question was already asked a long time ago and that creepy kid did not look anything like jesus to me

but you do think that something changed

i don’t know whether it’s good or bad

what if it’s neither suggested nick what if we get to make it one or the other

if god created shadows it was to better emphasise the light

maybe i am everything i knew that i would never be i looked back at jay and smiled

consultwhat reinforcement we may gain from hopeif not what resolution from despair

your words like wings gravity they defy

my heart like a leaf on the wind catchin rides

we make too much sense to foolishly pass it by

so im taking a rainbow up to the th floor

steppin out to see that youre really worth more

hope is possible when you decide to believe that what you are hoping for is possible

i finished the blog post reflecting on the fact that despite all the changes in my life maybe i wasnt so different after all if i typed it maybe i could believe it too

hope comes not from the people around you but from yourself

the grand essentials of happiness are something to do something to love and something to hope for

we must be a beacon of hope because if you tell people theres nothing they can do they will do worse than nothing

the future is an infinite succession of presents and to live now as we think human beings should live in defiance of all that is bad around us is itself a marvelous victory

i can always look up at the cosmos and marvel no matter what happens and when i look up at it i feel as though my problems are small i dont know why but it always makes me feel better

you won’t ever get ahead if you keep feeling sorry for yourself you must stop all the negative talk and start thinking positive you have a lot of potential but your life won’t change until you change how you think

in the future as in the present as in the past black people will build many new worlds

this is true i will make it so and you will help me

there is a period for hope and one for mourning

from the mud of adversity grows the lotus of joy

hope is nothing but a deceitful flatterer accepted by reason only because it is often in need of palliatives

whoso beset him round

with dismal stories

do but themselves confound

his strength the more is

they knew though she would not suffer as they had suffered she was perfect they were scarred

no point carrying useless ballast it wont change a thing

and hope is but a dream of those that wake

books open the doors that others have closed on you

death seemed to lose its terrors and to borrow a grace and dignity in sublime keeping with the life that was ebbing away

it isn’t true is it daniel that music can tame the beasts yet in the end a song lives

can human beings change the humor and the sadness of remarriage comedies can be said to result from the fact that we have no good answer to that question

over time i have come to believe that there is a killer and a saint in all of us buti choose to focus on the future and the potential in people

an opportunity is a miracle waiting to happen

we live in a time that hungers for hope to believe in miracles and dreams for without these soul gems humanity is ripped at the seams

everyone has to have hope in their life or they will eventually become your enemy

you know molly if you can hold in your mind what you want long enough you shall have it

koudelka looked back you i know you you trust beyond reason

cordelia met his eyes steadily yes its how i get results beyond hope as you may recall

what will you do now with the gift of your left life

the power of hope even a lack of ambition can for a time pay off as a necessary facet as long as hope outweighs it

we must look to marys example to know how to deal with the glorious impossibilities of god look how she turned the world upside down by making one simple statement

shed stood by that creed no softness because the world wasnt soft lots of laughter because if you were in on the joke the joke couldnt be on you and no wanting what you couldnt take because the world never gave

or so shed thought

some people us language to describe the lives they lead and other people use language to create the lives they lead

from les miserables

cosette and jean valjean fell on their knees

they knew not what it was they knew not where they were but both of them the man and the child the penitent and the innocent felt that they must kneel

these voices had this strange characteristic that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted it was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house

while these voices were singing jean valjean thought of nothing he no longer beheld the night he beheld a blue sky it seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us unfolding

the song died away it may have lasted a long time jean valjean could not have told hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment

i shuffle along letting the current pull me and i have the sense that i am like a rat caught in a maze of tunnels moving endlessly toward some promise ofof what light life cheese

if the single man plants himself indomitably on his instincts and there abides this huge world will come around to him

so much of how we think feel and live depends on our visionwhat we choose to see in any given situation

life is a precious possessionit is what one makes of it  charity duncan

the years stretched before her a long and dusty way yet if she could walk humbly along it she might find that life unfolding slowly keeps its best secrets till the end

she did not care about anything very much hope was gone she existed that was all

merry christmas  i whisper to myself merry christmas nate

mira she thought and treasured it each time she heard it they must keep me family

its okay youre going to save me miss maylene the girl gave her a genuine look of happiness i know it i knew if i found you everything would be okay

despair wishes their hope diminishes

it took more than science to make hope real

ill be singing hymns to the rafters be praising his goodness so loud theyre going to have to turn down the volume in heaven

they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint

just when it seemed my mother couldn’t bear

my sister in silence stood at the end

of the bed and slowly rubbed her feet

which were scratchy with hard yellow skin

and dirt cramped beneath the broken nails

which changed nothing in time except

the way my mother was lost in it for a while

as if with a kind of relief that doesn’t relieve

and then with her eyes closed my mother said

the one or two words the living have for gratefulness

which is a kind of forgetting with a sense

of what it means to be alive long enough

to love someone thank you she said as for me

i didn’t care how her voice suddenly seemed low

and kind or what failures and triumphs

of the body and spirit brought her to that point—

just that it sounded like hope stupid hope

dont be such a partypooper missy when youre well and truly screwed either you just sit pissing yourself or you invent some reason to hope

there it must be i think in the vast and eternal laws of matter and

not in the daily cares and sins and troubles of men that whatever is

more than animal within us must find its solace and its hope i hope or i

could not live

hope is the last thing that dies

maybe because hope is one of those dratted things that is truly honestly genuinely immortal

i must reluctantly observe that two causes the abbreviation of time and the failure of hope will always tinge with a browner shade the evening of life

dullness it is that perverts and corrups the spirit but it is always possible to look past the dullness and see the bright shining heart of things

for hope is the road travelled between impossible to possible

believe in the hope of your life illusion because this is the only real thing that you posses

plain kate greased her boots and bandaged her feet and soon she would walk like a roamer born she helped drina with the water and the wood and in the long wet evenings she carved objarka burji

plain kate carved fast and learned slowly she was bewildered most of the time but daj called her mira again and when she asked drina what it meant the girl replied it means she likes you it means your family

it could have kept her walking for a hundred miles and she did walk far

hope is a place best not forgotten

why not why not anything if god ain’t a god of why nots than i say ‘why bother’ and i don’t think that’s takin his name in vain i think it’s tellin the truth about what people need

you must remember that your story matters what you write has the power to save a life sometimes that life is your own

i dont much like my life but for some dumb reason i want to be alive because sooner or later i figure it will work out

the balance—between resignation and hope—shifted by day by the hour sometimes by the minute he was always always trying to decide how he should be—if his thoughts should be of acceptance or escape

hoping will create suffering suffering will create meaning meaning will make your life beautiful

the most destructive instruments can still create a melody worth dancing to

through you will call forth praise from lonesome travelers long after your name is forgotten they will know someone lived and loved here

the size of an ending will never offset the inevitability of a beginning

every person is someones child

love does not discriminate

love and blessings to all

give into hope i say for fear will only paralyze it is better to live a life of love amidst the pain than a life of apathy

your breakdown is not the end of your story

a breakthrough is on its way

hope is a place best not forgotten’  iain cameron williams

all i wanted was this place of glory

and things that can never be

to be

love yourself more and spread love all around you

think about your future in a positive way and you will move towards your goals

the soul can heal by getting closer to god it’s the mind that creates the distance

be grateful life is a gracious gift

its not surrendering to the universe he told me if all youre doing is sitting around waiting for it to turn out like you hope

let us welcome the new year with a holy hearts

do you think shell change

is there a cure

only art or more love

i should die of more love

babies win over the world with love hope and angelic smiles

a baby is like the morning sunshine it comes with the lights of love hope warmth beauty and endless possibilities

a baby is a symbol of hope and one of lifes blessings

a baby is the hope and ultimate purpose of life it is the best gift that life can give so we can enjoy life after life

leonard cohen never broke my heart but his songs have every time i sing or hear one of them as leonard says there is a crack in everything that’s how the light gets in

maybe it doesnt makes any sense right now but just know that one day it will cause nothing is happening without a reason

she saidone day you will change the world by the way you think the way you act and the way you dream until then i will hold you close and remind you that you are pure love

fearlessly be youfaith feels like your falling off a cliffbut you find the courage you jump anyway

it took dust in my eyes to see clearly it took fasting for me to understand hunger  it took forgiveness for me know love

she said i hope i can add a little color in the world with my thoughts my dreams and my hope in mankind

if the regime had a factory producing hope the resistance had a factory producing the tools of despair

who put this brain inside of me

it cries

it demands

it says that there is a chance

it will not say

no

that’s the problem with letting the light in—after it’s been taken away from you it feels even darker than it was before

as a child the adults were my heroes but as an adult with cancer it’s the children who are my heroes

no matter what pain what hard things come to us in life—and pain and trouble come to all of us—no matter what dark roads we walk or poor choices we make it is not the end of the story

belief was a fraying rope bridge over a stormy sea strand by silver strand i unraveled

they survived on the bare bones of hope

without hope theres no growth without growth there is no life

im a speckled seal swimming past the breakers a seabird with a wingspan so long i can fly for miles im the new moon hidden and safe from him from everyone

don’t let anybody anybody convince you this is the way the world is and therefore must be it must be the way it ought to be

sometimes you get so high on life only because you truly know what it’s like to live from the bottom of the barrel

whats worse

to live after losing hope or die when you have suffered beyond limitless

hope not despair not the human race is the human race nothing can be done about it

to forgive ourselves for what we didnt do

replay a scene over and over in mind

change it change

apologizing to our own story handful of soil

i could have planted something better here

to walk without remembering another walk

to wash off the hoped of a darkened day

this year we wont keep company with anger bitterness and envy our inner circle will include hope faith and joy

if you wish to cry cry

you find yourself selling dreams of spectacular hereafters possible only if you believe if you really really believe

you always do things for others sake without worrying about yourself or how you feel but this time i want you to be selfish its okay to cry just dont shut me out its my turn to help you this time let me be your hope

a man find his own power through endurance of pain

tears sprang into grace’s eyes she slipped her gaze to mae again and gave her a tremulous smile it is better but still hard

i know dear but this is not the end of your story

i firmly believe god is still in the business of miracles

my dreams and nightmares have the same people in them

we cannot create hope where there is hopelessness or love where there is lovelessness we cannot create repentance where there is unrepentance but we can cry out to the god who can

carefully make your choices

tell god all your troubles

trust in god at all times even in times of troubles

when we sing we can do anything—change the world bring peace be our best selves at last when we sing our hearts can lift and fly over the troubled waters and over the years

the best resolution is the grace to repent

may every baby adorn our life with the power of hope and fill our hearts with the beauty of love

hope is a mackerel sky

youre my heart youre my miracle youre my hope youre my true angel

a baby is a messenger of the future carrying letters from the past written in the language of love hope and genetic imprints

ah my little angel my paragon of love and my light of hope for the future

sometimes we create such powerful illusions so that we do not get lost in the darkness

education isnt education when you use it as makeup to cover the scars of your insecurities

its that season of unreasoning hope

do not get discourage in times of difficulties

there was no hope of survival anymore i felt abandoned and betrayed i never imagined such a terrible death and i was so conscious that it was happening now

nature is all abundantnature suggests hope joy abundance belief regeneration allowance sharing love beauty and acceptance

there is no success like salvation

the only reality is repentance

a house that has books has hope

may your want be turned into worship

christ is the center that holds all things together

and everything belongs to me but hope

her smile could persuade a dead lacerated heart

it takes bravery to cry out to release what is in your heart

a mans life is like a burning candle

people act all surprised when someone dies i think thats a sign that they forget we not permanent residents on this  earth

tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life

i couldn’t weep here any more than i could hope of course he couldn’t stay and much as i wanted him by me i wanted even more that my friend have what he wanted for himself

if youve told a little boy that big boys dont cry youve marginalized his voice

if you truly are seeking answers of wholeness why do you continue to engage in conversations rooted in partiality

we should not use the worst to define us as a people and we use not use the best to excuse the bullshit of the worst

what he is really saying is this this is how the story must end our hearts can bear no more loss

a man knows how to confront confrontation without being confrontational

an arrival always follows a departure to achieve a goal you must depart from something

there is no satisfaction like the study of the scriptures

hope child is one of the most important things in life with hope we take the next step forward

the maker is merciful

do not doubt eternity of your existence

the greatest thing is to love god

and the hope my dear is when you go to sleep knowing that you will wake up in the morning

we must not only survive but strive

a man lives on hope he keeps thinking things will somehow straighten themselves out

you see hope in dark places and defend true love you’re saving happy endings and giving them out because you believe in love even if it’s a hard road

this is whats become of us i am

confused by mourning and he is the sun

that goes to sleep on top of me undone

by moonrise lover all i speak is iambs

and slant rhyme that devil lamb

of light called hope is sacrificed and none

too pleased with having lost its bleat the stone

has rolled away but gods not gone and damn

it im no fan of the weather here it rains

too often bones of doves and angel down

until the ground stains red with sighs and blood

it is wet and cold will you explain

again the why of all there is and how

he caught me in the act discovering god

every sprig of hope i plant

turns wilty in my palm

tell your brain to be kind to you today easy on the memories heavy on hope and quiet with the criticism

at all times trust in god

i always have hope alaric said hope child is one of the most important things in life with hope we take the next step forward

ellen read the treasure

to convert is to convinced

if the universe would need the love of us careless humans

to keep its restless heart alive

the sky would be full of dead stars

a baby is the most powerful person on earth for they are born with the power of pure love and precious hope

waste no time to worry but pray about everything

so long as the future remains unwritten theres hope

praying is a pleasurable paradise

praying is a holy pilgrimage

touch everyone and everything with your soul

for there resides the secret of every happiness

god is teaching us something very meaningful – whether of the unexpected powers of endurance of those affected or the hidden depths of compassion of those who respond

i look up in

hope dreaming to be

brightened up and

begotten out of

this hazy funk and

my light glowing

high above me she

angelic halo as

my spirits rise up to

hopeless change be contagious but hope can be too and there is no medicine to match it

no holiness no heaven

endurance is painful but perfect the soul with the spirit

singleness of purpose is the key to success

without god there is no grace

a poets promise gives readers permission  to hope for a better future

stand firm in your faith

wait patiently but watch prayerfully

we never know what we must endure

death of a beloved leaves a deep hole in our heart

hopelessness can be contagious but hope can be too and there is no medicine to match it

this was the unexpected  unforeseeable resolution of the paradox  her personal goodness was no longer the issue because it had been replaced by the sweetness of relationship

the thin shell of hope cracked and my thoughts emotions and fears scrambled

i’m not interested in some theoretic sermon that ends with a hope and prayer dad i need to hear something real something that literally broke the fabric of your life a story that ends with proof of life instead of some wishywashy platitude

hope deferred makes the heart sick but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life

in a world with so much darkness we must recognize and praise the good no matter how small for each gem of goodness shines when held up to the light and gives up hope that our world is worth saving

i believe someday i would be loved like i want to be loved by the person i want to be loved by in a place where there would be love alone and no room for doubt or fear yes i believe in miracles

and the hope my dear is when you go to sleep knowing that you may not wake up in the morning

without god there is no grace

i dreamed to

breath to

sigh to

float above

watertops through

sunrise and sunset

impressions all throughout

my every atom

for the longest time i

my dream flower

with the right amount of light even the darkest of darkness glows

he wanted to talk and she wanted more than anything to see him smile

we were never taught how to give up hope and this is why today we perish in gas chambers

we are never too old or too wounded to receive healing waves of the personal delight of another

at its best it transcends being delighted with a particular happening and is instead the reflection to us and often to one another of an enduring bond that is bigger than any single occurrence between us

when we are small and see that look on our parents faces there is such an affirmation that we are good lovable welcome

these experiences go deep into us and become an implicit foundation for drawing in warm companions throughout our lives

hope rises like smoke from the forest i can’t let myself follow it yet

america what happened to your optimism your new frontiers your simple rockwell dreams im plunging into your night america pushing myself deep into your heart like a knife but the blade of my weapon is hope

we humans are always seeking the warmest attachments we can imagine

i want to believe in a new thing lord i want that more than anything i want to forget the old things—the bad and ugly things that have sent me here please let me see your hand in all of this let me see the path through this wilderness

we live within and beyond our own skin at the same time

our brains are continuously yearning for the arrival of a coorganizing other

in any attachment encounter there is both what we perceive being offered and our embodied response to it

if we call to mind heart and body three or four people with whom weve had particularly close relationships how do our bodies respond to their offers of connection

we can begin by being with muscles belly heart and breath how does our body want to move

disguised as a friend my thoughts waltz in asking if reason would like to dancelogic being a gentleman said nothing and i was fooled again

girls and their dates still got dressed to go to the apollo for amateur night but by  pretty much every representation of hope in the country had been put up against a wall and shot

in the castle of lurid smiles

in the realm of void ecstasy

in the clutches of mad nostalgia

there flowed a river of serene tranquility

charmed by the halo of yet unknown

and there she trespassed

to hear the resonance of her soul

to touch the rainbow of her sun

to feel the nerve of her being

she seemed to love her nest

a tender bud caressing the depth of sweet solitude

yet she longed to traverse through that river

crossing the limps of jolting madness

for sometimes she heard the beckoning of a rainbow

burning the sky of a distant land

charmed by the halo of yet known

carter once told me that we shouldn’t fear putting the past behind us he said that god is about doing new things—creating beauty out of the ashes of despair and defeat

we stayed with the one who felt dead inside acknowledging his protective value even though we had no cognitive awareness of who and what he was sheltering

what is this depression this one who is so still wanting to tell us

bit by bit our people begin to embody the changed anticipation of being cared for and treated with kindness and respect

part of what strengthens this new way of being comes from us having cointernalized one another

we continue to be their reflective companion on the outside and they will also feel how we continue to carry them with us in our inner world

it is quite beautiful to watch this healing unfold often revealing itself as changes in body feeling behavior relational choices first then later affirmed in more frequent words of tenderness toward themselves

success is always found in unknown places and you can never reach such places without hope and belief

hope eliminates all kinds of fear and makes you stronger

to believe is to obey

hope is a healer

begin each day with the blessings of a prayer

depression always brings to mind the possibility that the persons seeking system may have been turned off

our mutual trust in his systems wisdom kept us from being swept away by the despair he felt we began to ask what is this depression this one who is so still wanting to tell us then we waited

we stayed with the one who felt dead inside acknowledging his protective value even when though we had no cognitive awareness of who and what he was sheltering

in these pages we keep returning to one foundational principle providing the possibility of emotionalrelational safety for our people be they patients children partners friends or strangers

when we neuroceive safety we humans automatically begin to open into vulnerability and the movement of our inherent treatment plan sills  has a greater probability of coming forward

farmers are professional hopers

when an experience is too strong for our current internal and external regulatory resource to manage  chemical changes activate to tuck these pathways into our  body

in this way our ongoing lives are protected from the constant incursion of the raw pain and fear and the injured parts of ourselves are partly shielded from new injury

we might say they have been enwombed awaiting the arrival of support

at the same time the memories also remain malleable enough that they can be touched and awakened which is essential for healing

what can look like an outofproportion response to what is happening in the moment is exactly in proportion to what is unfolding internally

implicit memory can change

profound resources of inherent wisdom and health are alive in us

every dream is laughable until theyve seen you achieve it

success is just a stepping stone to what youve already achieved

make it happen or it wont

whatever you desire you must first become

dreams are conceived when you factor in and implement the small steps that will lead you to your victory

i would have cried if i had any sorrow left i would have shouted if anger still burned within me but there was nothing nothing but hope and despair and despair was winning

it is our duty to pray for such an act brings us to the presence of the mighty god who desires to show mercy to all who call upon his holy name

we were humbled by every hardship

stop and consider life is but a day

a fragile dewdrop on its perilous way

from a trees summit a poor indians sleep

while his boat hastens to the monstrous steep

of montmorenci why so sad a moan

life is the roses hope while yet unblown

the reading of an everchanging tale

the light uplifting of a maidens veil

riding the springy branches of an elm

never give up hope that’s the one thing that makes you keep going

hope and despair are never together

hope faith and confidence can miraculously change the life of any person

often people give up when the distance between their hope and outcome is too short

even a little ray of hope has the potential to turn you into a big star

hope is good but it’s more like examination result we need to prepare appear  than wait for result hope is good problem comes when people despite lackadaisical efforts still wait for days which arent even part of their calendar

each moment knows its own mystery

the darkness as well as the light were divinely ordered to fulfill a sacred purpose

maybe it took the ugly thingsthe ashes the scraps the dirtto grow the beautiful things

each time i experience the unseen wisdom of a persons system it deepens my trust in the inner process unfolding and my awe at the way we are organized to be protected until the possibility of healing arrives

may we each find a forestbathing path that can be a daily balm in this taxing world

traumas embed when our system is overwhelmed by pain and fear without having sufficient internal resources or companionship to help integrate the experience

our people may see others being present but as either unavailable for support or actively injurious or the experience may have been so terrifying that even had someone tried to help our people might not have been able to receive it

we can perhaps hold both the desire to separate from these bodily memories and the willingness to be with them in the broad embrace of welcome and compassion

i do believe this kind of acceptance is a lifetimes work that inevitably leads to failure at times our biology wants to protect us from what may harm us and the arising of implicit memory can feel quite threatening

if we can soften towards our own tendency to want to move away and offer to begin again with gestures of inclusion this is likely what is possible and optimal for us humans

humility and grace are perhaps the gifts of this tension gifts that we can then extend to our people in the form of honoring their struggle

yes the world is full of unspeakable cruelty but the answer wasnt to never feel hope or bliss or lovebut to savor every fleeting precious second of those feelings when they came

whenever you feel there is no hope remember you

not all roads are pretty and worth something they are hard overwhelming and shake you to your core but in the tiny cracks of light that keep you moving forward holds tiny moments of hope and in a dark place hope is a grande’ thing

have you ever hurt your heart wanting wanting for years

asking why what happened

happened hoping beyond the last desire to feel hope—

it is difficult to sleep when you are besieged by hope

despair is not your portion

when they want to know about your latest relationship tell them the moon didnt return your phone call last night but you are hopeful

god says i know the plans i have for you plans for good and not for evil plans for a future and a hope

transformation is not about an emotion it is about a commitment to a process of good will and anyone can do it

and hope never abandoned us  only we could abandon it

children are starving for story the kind that builds on hope the kind that echos for a lifetime we need story in our lives not dreams based on greed

the hope that we may one day awaken to a condition of life utterly different from that which we experience daily makes men willing victims of every form of tyranny and suppression man is stultified by hope and fear

…we have futures that means we can make things true…

she firmly believed that fears were best fought headon courage being fear stuffed with hope and whatnot

for the next weeks i hit snooze over and over in some wild hope that the morning would just pack up and leave me alone

i wish i had been what i thought i was and so debonnaire and so debonnaire

the heart of the matter

chaos bleeds the land

nothing thrives well when there is great divide

it’s the heart issues that move a man

tolerance must be on all sides

never be quick to judge a man

— danny castillones sillada an existentialist and surrealist painter

i hadn’t thought of—let alone said—soul leading in many years and stumbled awkwardly through the words ian spoke it without hesitation though and i wondered how often he had used it through those years

the greatest secret to lifes success is to help someone else achieve it

another gate of success was widely open for her a reckless step led to an unexpected career sometimes that’s what we hope for after every mistake we make

somewhere between the stars

there is a place for you and me

and the darkness fades away

said and she saw in his eyes as

the interest of the story died

away in them something else

take its place something

wondering pale like the

reflection of a light which at

once made him gaze and marvel

turning she looked across the

bay and there sure enough

coming regularly across the

and then one long steady stroke

was the light of the lighthouse

it had been lit

to the lighthouse

in whatever battle were facing we too often lose hope and once weve lost hope weve not only lost the battle weve lost everything else as well

i dont believe in magic yet i see making wishes as a nod to hope an acknowledgement of the power of will the recognition of a goal

and that’s the end she

said and she saw in his eyes as

of the nature of women nothing final can be known never had i found such comfort in a void in the black absence of knowledge

made to resist the fury of the storms

like cliffs beside the ocean

or clouded savage peaks

hope magicvoiced foretells the day

when on the rock of harmony

the siren traitorous shall die and pass away

and there shall only be

the full frankbillowed music of the sea

be hopeful still

from song with rancorous illwill

and blinded races one another spurn

among the high her rebel cry has raised

the cannibal still lusts after the raw

knifetoothed and goryfaced

towers your laughing banners now unfold

against all hatreds and all envious lies

upraise the protest of the breeze halftold

and the proud quietness of sea and skies…

what is usual is not what is always

as sometimes in old age hearing comes back

footsteps resume their clipped edges

birds quiet for decades migrate back to the ear

where were they by what route did they return

a woman mute for years

forms one perfect sentence before she dies

sometimes when things seem like they are falling apart they are actually falling into place

at the end of hope

a good man is measured by what he is willing to sacrifice to commend his love toward that he is always willing to give himself over to the promotion of ideals dreams and the imagination of things to come that may benefit anyonebut himself

no matter how hard you try to fit the pieces together sometimes its beyond your control so sit back and trust in his plans

well if there’s a hell like this place then there has to be a heaven somewhere

if you’re not changing forwards you’re changing backwards because we are always changing

we build bridges arching

instead of walls we craft doors

with ancient wisdom

instead of weapons we create future generations

by words of life

instead of oppression we live we breathe

we adapt to life as it comes recreating it around us

again and again

hoping that one day it will be allowed to stay

be the light in the darkness

i was walking and walking beside a small stream and only stopped as i saw a big rounded tree what made me stop was that the tree had leaves the size of a palm bigger then any size i had seen in my life

i stepped under its shade looking closer at the magical tree and found that my name was carved at its big trunk

i was still surprised and bewildered at my finding when i felt the tree shake and a leaf fell in front of me i was about to pick it up when more and more leaves started to fall leaving

the tree with only half of the leaves i tried my best to stop my tree from shaking when i woke up from my dream i was breathing heavily my heart was beating fast i was soaked

my life the leaves are falling one by one from my life

i said to myself as i closed my eyes hoping for my life to find spring again

or dark

or fly

look to nature for comfort and believe

each sunrise brings hope

each wave in the ocean brings joy

each drifting cloud brings relief

each gust of wind steers positive thoughts our way

each sparkling star fills our hearts with love and light

when the glow in the mountains lights your soul

when you find yourself looking at the splendour of the clouds or a bird in flight

pause and drop a pin

when the movement of wind on the water lulls you into a timeless peace

when the setting sun holds you in its golden light

pause and drop a pin

when life shrinks you down

when you lose your way and cold winds make you pull your jacket tightly over your chest

when you feel darkness enter your mind and hope seems out of reach

remember all the sacred places that invited you into yourself

remember the vast expanse of all those pins

a little piece of you lives in those corners

dont let your heart shrink or your world grow small

relax into your expansive and most radiant heart

we dont end at our own skin we will always exist everywhere we have dropped a pin

if no one loves her

please love you

even if she’s a wreckage

or lost in a predetermined path

or broken by a perfect love

or loved by your sacrificial loneliness

even when you have no stone

or judge her abysmal tombstone

or her nothingness collapses your passion

out of frozen concrete

from sublime bottles

no one full ever knew how to fill

without hope we are helpless

hope is that final fuel to complete the fact

today is a hard day sometimes there are hard days days stretched so tight with pain that they seem as if they can allow no room for hope

in the coming days theres a question i want you to ask yourselves if not me then who

if not me then who will stand for people whose voices arent being heard

if not me then who will stand for the right of all people to lead lives of joy and dignity

if not me then who will stand for facts and reason and learning and truth

if not me then who will stand for kindness

if not me then who will stand for honesty

if not me then who will stand for generosity

if not me then who will stand for equality and justice

but i have learned in the last year more than ever before that sometimes we have to be loud

if i had to give the young one piece of advice it would be this dont believe in tomorrow

it’s not the pain that’s unendurable it’s the hopelessness it’s the hopelessness that makes you reckless

that’s what i need right now something to save me from being pulled under by hope again

are you happy

i think i may be going to be happy

remember things do not force forge or fashion they fall into place

be grateful for each day even the dark ones

there is always light in the midst of darkness even if it is only a pinpoint int he distance

may the saints of all the stars and constellations bring you hope as they guide you out of the dark and into the light on this voyage and the next and all the journeys still to come for now and evermore  the doctor

optimists are the least prepared for the loss of hope

he had always found hope harder to deal with than despair despair didnt get disappointed

hope is a lovers staff walk hence with that

and manage it against despairing thoughts

from the time of snowmelt

when the creek roared

and the mud slid

and the seeds cracked

i listened to the earthtalk

the rootwrangle

the arguments of energy

the dreams lying

just under the surface

then rising

at the last moment

flaring and luminous

excerpt from the poem wild trilliums

the beautiful thing about hope is that it acts exclusively of the thing being hoped for during a dark day the prospect of a bright tomorrow offers you strength today regardless of what tomorrow actually holds

youre indescribablly beautiful he finally whispered truly

he was in love with her she realized with sudden force

i dare to hope

the book she held had collapsed against her chest planted like a shield between her tender heart and all that discouraged and despaired

when prayer flags flutter and the prayers inscribed on them blend into the wind the surroundings sing hope soars compassion spills may those feelings guide us all through the day

courage is not the absence of fear

its to feel the fear and do it anyway

god’s faith in me always dwarfs my faith in him

f all we see are cinders and ashes all we see is ‘what was’ at the expense of what the cinders and ashes are preparing to be

player sir i don’t think we will win this match every team member is convinced about the loss the discussion is only about how badly

coach what do you think

the player i think we only win if we decide to win but i am just one member of the team i can’t do anything on my own at the end of the day it’s a team game one person can make a difference but the games are won by the teams

coach so go there and make a difference

player how

player but what about the negative mindset of some players

coach don’t worry about them they are like sheep will anyways follow the majority keep trying and most of them will feel ashamed of not doing anything at least they will pretend to try and that will give a positive signal to other players

coach well find your motivation in fighting the loss of hope picture yourself in a post win situation go for the win  take others along even if some needs to be carried on your back

suffering gives you hope

the words they spoke the feelings that would not take the form of words forgotten promises unrealized hopes frustrated longings

bear the ills of life without being bitter

hope sees what we can’t and because we can’t hope asks us to believe that it can

god is not dead—

she has forsaken us

we wipe our angry hatefilled tears

after another shooting as a man

polishes his gun outside a mosque

all those stolen lives—we scream

for justice but god has quietly left

our temples and churches

she will not return for what we have done

is much worse we have murdered

god has deserted even the devout of us

who save our love and compassion

for those good and righteous as we abandon the bigots

brimming with hate yes those least deserving

of love but the most in need of it

god’s agony rings in our hearts she wails for the future

shooters though we reject them

god greets these cracked and confused creatures—

the least deserving of compassion but the most in need of it

we’ve read their spiteful tweets but when we pass

them in classrooms in trains and markets we dismiss

those seemingly small opportunities for kindness

we don’t know—and how ignorant we are—

that every time we ignore them

we sharpen our daggers

and stab humanity in its pink raw flesh

not in dark alleyways no we do this openly

in broad daylight for hating them

shows how loving we are for condemning

them proves how moral we are

but every shooting illumines

the failure of our collective duty to love

as god loves to be compassionate as god

your prayers heal yes

but for god’s sake let god be

resurrect your humanity

optimism is the act of dreaming and believing at the same time there is hope in optimism otherwise pessimism would minimize the chances of the triumphal entry of hope

are you in pain

do not panic pray

hope never comes late we should consistently practice it

hope moves barriers for one who has learned to move by decision

hope divides seas for a captain of a shipwreck

brainpower is our inner genius that craves to radiate creativity positivity hope and ideas for the greater good of our real self and the world

one needs to keep reminding themselves of higher goals at all times while observing the outcomes of smaller actions

i understand now that magic is not for wickedness not for the devil not for those with cruel hearts its for hope for survival it thrives in the darkness not because it is dark in nature but because the fire shines brightest then

hope is contagious when you have enough it spreads naturally

i hope you fall in love with someone who treats you right

i hope you fall in love with someone who kisses your scars kisses right where it hurts and make you feel alright

i hope you fall in love with someone who knows how to make you laugh

i hope you fall in love with someone who’ll never make you question your worth or the fact that you are enough

and darling i hope you fall in love with that one who’ll let you sleep peacefully at night with no doubts that may eat you alive…

id grown fond of quoting václav havel the great czech leader who had said that hope was the one thing that people struggling in eastern europe needed during the era of soviet domination

it seemed unfair

and unfinished

and now it would always be tragic

because you kept

loving them

even when the story ended

and there was nowhere

to spill the ink

of the heartbreak their absence wrote

people just aren’t going to get it

it’s an everelusive concept to be understood

all you can hope for

is that you find someone that tries

find someone that tries

the mask

we often pair the turmoil in our mind

with a calm exterior

hoping that the mask

will serve as a floodgate

to hold back the chaos

of our swirling thoughts

you are completely free to reject everything we have to say about spirituality what we believe in is not that important what really counts is what you believe that gives your life meaning direction and purpose

as i stand cloaked in some seemingly perpetual darkness desperately hoping for a scant ray of light i ask why has the sun never risen and i realize that it rose a long long time ago i just refused to open my eyes sufficiently to see it

but in the next moment i cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all

nothing is so cold and so calculating as money in a void where love and hope had been

what she had shared with akiva could not be touched by shame madrigal lifted her voice to say we dreamed together of the world remade

i wish my hair was blue

in the requiem grove with akiva it finally was

it is evil to give up on someone before them

let us get back to the winning ways let’s forget about despair let’s hope better things for tomorrow time to let go of what’s saddens our hearts

hope is an essential emotiondespair gives birth to monsters

no hope but death to bury up our shame

let adversity reinforce your principles and values not destroy them hold on to them like a strong tree holding on to the ground and his roots against the winds and tempest the storm will pass

people would whisper about us

and our fall from grace

as our world fell to ruin

and our worst fears were realized

we’d be submerged and forgotten

the stuff of speculation

we were a lost city

singing our siren ballads

of heartbreak and woe

from the depths below

we were here

we were here

we were here…

once you understand the value of time constraints you life will suddenly be free with freedom you’ll be better enabled to provide joy to those you serve with intentional attention

to be defenseless did not mean to be without honor

lets never stop searching for our kindred souls

the ones that take us from the darkness of the night to the daybreak of hope

almost everybody needs ideas to live by including hope and faith in order to tolerate the hardships of existence

hopelessness can create an atmosphere where fixable problems become unfixable ones we must work to resist this erosion in our belief in the potential of our own behavior and actions to change things

there is a far greater purpose for us and the world more than we can see or some would like us to see

we must carry on and trust infinitely the power of the soul

hope was the wind that came from nowhere to fill your sails and carry you home

she hopes she might convince her sea monster that she will not abandon her

a broken soul is like an alabaster box that contains expensive perfume god recognizes its sweet aroma our personal composition of failure and frustration through which he chooses to teach us humility patience and hope

someday is my favorite day of the week

battling for our wounded warriors to have a better tomorrow for what they battled for us yesterday

could it that the impossible is compelling because we have just enough god within us to know the impossible to be achievable and just enough of ourselves within us to know that we have to rely on him to do it

time is the most powerful healer that heals almost every wound just trust the process take your time and let the healing begin

inside of my soul they lay

one twisted devil and hundreds of angels pray

so whenever my devil sings its gloomy song through my mind

those angels gather and whisper through my heart

prayers of hope and peace that my soul rises upon the highest sky…

the bravest of whom i’ve known are those who have been through suffering disappointments and pain

but still they choose to love fearlessly give nonstop and live with hope that fills their lungs …

the man who leaves you is simply clearing the way for the one you deserve

where have you been i softly answered followed by a question i wanted to laugh hysterically at the controlled calmness of it all as if nothing at all had happened as if he hadn’t resurrected himself after an eternity of absence

new york i have a good friend there i found a job a place i had to away from here away from bella from you

swallowing i clasped my hands together to stop from trembling and i said in a low audible voice from me

he sighed heavily i can’t love you helena i still love bella and i suppose i could love another woman in another way at the same time but not you

…but why i tried hard to keep my voice and gaze even i glanced at the plain wedding ring on the third finger on his left hand his wedding band it was gleaming brightly in the firelight i felt my heart plummet like a disappointed child

the world tells us to be our best selves to be amazing to be an inspiration sometimes its nice to just be

the best day includes time for play

today is the day

who longs in solitude to live

ah soon his wish will gain

and leave him to his pain

no matter how bleak or menacing a situation may appear it does not enitrely own us it cant take away our freedom to respond our power to take action

a fact of life is there is tragedy and hope there is sadness and joy to ignore one over the other will destroy a person

you might say sure thing nao im okay im doing just fine

okay awesome i would say to you and then we would smile at each other across time like we were friends because we are friends by now arent we

hopes are so very well constructed

once the change

the change outside began

the crawling caterpillar spread her wings

and the consequences were felt around the globe

choose the positive because its all good be honest be open stop and think see the red flags let go of ego now make a healthy choice

nothing but a symbol people die for symbols people have hope because of symbols theyre not just lines theyre histories cultures traditions given shape

waiting is still an occupation it is having nothing to wait for that is terrible

worrying requires way more energy than hoping which—unlike worrying—is energizing

isnt that how the world is going to change by each of us putting ourselves out there facing despair and taking care of one another

sometimes the brightest lights come out of the darkest corners

for wasnt it just a matter of time before we crossed each others path

for wasnt it just a matter of time before we crossed each others path

if you ask me what i live for ill say catharsis and hope and writing ill never be a defeatist

we live in the real world and make our choices based on what’s in front of us but we can always pray for a miracle

the whole world was out there but i was in my mothers arms and i didnt know it yet

we alone are responsible to choose whether we default to reflect the world or be a reflection upon the world

the mind says everyone is temporary but the heart fills you with the hope that someone will prove your mind wrong

everyday is a new opportunity to raise the bar make today count

but a man must have peaches if he comes upon a very bad day without peaches in syrup there’s nothing to look forward to and so man stays put and so a man drowns

his presence is found at the end of your rope

hold onto your miracle

its just a spark right now

guard it from the wind that blows

ignore the tongues that wag and the clock that drags so slow

day you day the spark to a flame will grow

on a day unexpected the miracle in life will show

we need to be honest with ourselves before we can truly be honest with others

trade in our cynical hopelessness for cynical hopefulness if we must be cynical choose hopeful over hopeless

hope alone will never change the state of your life hope simply comes to inspire you

hope prophesies on your future

hope enables you

to stand up and do

to stand up and rebuild

to stand up and live

i write romance because when it is driven by a female it empowers women and gives hope for a happy ending

blue sky and so much

dont hope for better times work towards them

when you want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it each thing has to transform itself into something better and to acquire a new personal legend until someday the soul of the world becomes one thing only

the suffering of pain and abandonment is overcome by the suffering of love which is not afraid of what is sick and ugly but accepts it and takes it in itself to heal it

one who has survived a forest fire would never let a spark go astray

fear is like a megaphone in your head that pulses aggression and sadness hope is the audio gain adjuster happiness is the musical algorithm

you may live in the world as it is but you can still work to create the world as it should be

hugging dad back feels like the good thing to do and my hope is to grow into a good man so i do it

hope can have sharp edges as it leaves you

hope is a sign of vitality with it anything is possible

everything is new and doomed

the soul finds no peace in peace it wanders in its longing for ignition

it is almost always better to take a chance and hope that your life will get better instead of ending it

it’s ok to not look back

it’s ok to look forward to the future

with a broken heart and a limp

is there any other way to

this side of heaven

i realize that even in the worst of times there’s always a ray of hope

sometimes there is so much that needs to be said that we must get really quiet in the hopes that someone out there is listening hard enough to the silence to hear every last word

and then what

and then i will show you a trick that dragons have

a tiny flicker of hope sprang to life in my heart

oh it should be more than a flicker haven’t you heard we dragons can light anything ablaze

and we’d all live happily ever after

okay that was a nice daydream but maybe it’s time to come back to reality

our parents are the worst for us the most difficult to endure precisely because they have the most intentions towards us hopes dreams needs for relationship acknowledgement

it wont be the same

i wont be the same

i don’t define darkness as the absence of light rather i define it as the absence of god and in that sense it’s never dark

i was never very fond of fourletter words but there was once a man who called me hope and i spent four long summers craving to find its synonyms

my heart yearns to be your heir

but my prayer remains unheard

speak to me that i may hear

and i will know that you can hear

for i need to see you here

your voice i wait to hear

your presence i seek to be near

that i may not live with fear

and i will always be your heir

and never wander like the deer

when expectations become desperation

may your might be my light

that i may see you as my guide

and do all things in your might

as i journey on with thy light

may i know who you really are

that i may know who i’m really are

as i stand between here and there

in a world that seeks to keep me here or there

so i may not be your heir

when all hope is gone

and all otherwise thoughts have come

may i smile for what you have done

as you overcome condemnation with redemption

and provide all needs for glorification

let us think often of this whatever comes our way christ will hold us fast uncertain as this life is we know this for certain he will bring us home

when it comes right down to it the only way to face a crises that makes any sense at all  is together and the only direction to face is up

when a broken person is down it takes builders to rebuild them from the bottom to the top

theres is always a way to make life better

we were decades still from a time when a simple google search would bring up a headspinning array of charts statistics and medical explainers that either gave or took away hope

we grow stronger and freer with every hope every belief we discard

first simeon takes the child jesus into his arms and praises god saying at last allpowerful master you give leave to your servant to go in peace according to your promise lk

should all the hoards of mankind assemble as one and bring the full force of their numbers against us we must remember that one man standing alone with god remains an immovable majority

now she felt a restlessness that went beyond that the old hopes felt too confining as if they were a dress she had outgrown perhaps you outgrew your dreams too as your world expanded

the year was past the edge heading away from the dark of course dark would come again but that was in the nature of the world many things were beginning

when im old i shall wear midnight shed decided but for now shed had enough of darkness

any dream that is all contemplation and no initiation is only a wish

he looked up at his old friend as if to say you see my predicament

the star seemed to respond i see

abel next put the question what shall i do

a book can change the world but a word of hope a smile and experienced advice can change a life

there is a solution for everything

as long as you believe

because belief is where magic is found

remember to hold onto hope

because hope is everlasting and endearing to your heart

and if you cant find a way create one

there is a solution for everything

some days are sweetened with pure but fleeting joy just keep keeping on

some days consist of a kind of sorrow that tries to break you just keep keeping on

some days are filled with bright warm light that clearly shows the path to follow just keep keeping on

some days are filled with calm and peace just keep keeping on

some days are filled with a violent commotion that does its best to disrupt our innermost harmony just keep keeping on

some days we must just take a rest until we can once again keep keeping on

some days are filled with hope and faith and the recognition of a journey we wouldnt trade for anything and so we keep keeping on

you bear it by working hard to get ready you bear it by having good people by your side you bear it by not just hoping but knowing you can handle a lot because you already have at least thats what always worked for me

and where are the windows where does the light come in

comfort was that elusive composite of fantasy and hope

there’s nothing wrong in dreaming

when you are awake

with hunger love and ache

the sky is unsure

why the arid moor feels bleak

quaking of earth to lure

the narrowness of creek

from the poem sprinkled

the world is not interested in what we do for a living what they are interested in is what we have to offer freely  hope strength love and the power to make a difference

he who had once been the declared optimist had not once expressed hope now it was she who was offering it to him and it might be false hope

hah nearly everyone i knows is dead mr weavall stared at the bunch of flowers for a while then straightened up again still cant do nothin about that can we not even for a box of gold

no mr weavall said tiffany hoarsely

oh dont cry gel the sun is shinin the birds is singin and whats past cant be mended eh

this love is like a dive under the ocean

and where are the windows where does the light come in

hope fought hard to stay alive even when you thought it was beaten to nothing burned to ashes drowned deep still it flickered away waiting to be found again

as we begin a new year let’s discard what was jaded let’s put on in its place the beautiful garments of faith hope and love

if the hope of giving

is to love the living

the giver risks madness

in the act of giving

if i have found promise it is because i’ve squeezed it from the seemingly impossible

isnt it time you found out its never too late until the race is done

sometimes i feel i am enough for anyone at other times i hope i am

you want to know something ive learned in my life

a lot of the people who influence you dont have anything to their name but time and experience it isnt the money it isnt the fame its not the temporary pleasures of life that keep you sane while youre in the dark

its hope

man is alive by his hope

never be so dependent on technology that a notification is the only thing that brings you hope

and here we are selling our dreams to someone else and getting paid for it with the counterfeit which we would keep safe all our life in the hope of using it to buy the dreams of others in the future again

we were planting seeds of change the fruit of which we might never see we had to be patient

people need stories child they bring us hope and that hope is real

do you know how magic works

the kind of magic that gets reindeer to fly in the sky the kind that helps father christmas travel around the world in a single night the kind that can stop time and make dreams come true

thats how

without hope there would be no magic

i hope i’ll always believe in love even if love shames me and tries to destroy me i hope i’ll want to start again

there he lost his love and half his crew if the tales be true…

hope is a crazy thing a courageous thing faith is a bold irrational choice

suffering is a given but so is joy

the distance that the dead have gone

does not at first appear

their coming back seems possible

for many an ardent year

and then that we have followed them

we more than half suspect

so intimate have we become

with their dear retrospect

life’s looking more beautiful now i didn’t sleep the whole night but it seems he has awakened me from an irrecoverable sleep

i think i can show them the path out i understand now that it’s not a question of faith or hope it exists and we can find it it’s going to take some time though

when life gives you another chance you don’t ask life questions like  why things turned out that way the previous time or why have you been so unfair instead you gladly accept the opportunity and say ‘why not

your heart is the place that balances all of your character pieces the essence of you when you’re in alignment with your life’s story peace is your reward a type of peace that inspires heals and encourages

when we elevate our communication we naturally elevate all outcomes of our life starting with our own heartour conversation with life itself

surrounded by the insanity of war its a special hope given knowing life can go on

heres the dealonly jesus gets to tell you who you are period any other voice is a lie from the pit of hell when jesus said it is finished he wasnt kidding then and there death and sin lost all legal claim over you

when youre in doubt glitter it out

when our hope is delayed it is not cancelled

explore the eternity of your existence

hope was mirage and none trusted easily to it

sometimes when we feel lost the universe sends a little help something or someone to guide us on our path she chuckles her eyes gleaming and that can come in the most unexpected form

hope is the best name in the world because it is the best quality of the human mind

is it

for me it is it’s all i have

beauty is you kept persuading but never pushed me into anything maybe that is why we kept connecting back and kept coming back

i hear myself singing – we shall overcome we shall overcome someday…

dont just hope be do and live in the moment

i’ve learned that the longgame is the shortcut

our hope is our offering to him our sacrifice and in our hope he is shaping us molding us drawing us to him we will now him here friend

it is the man without vision who sees only an ending yet it is the man of faith who sees an ending as the very place from which a thousand beginnings will be birthed

everything was not lost this was the message we needed to carry forward it’s what i truly believed it wasn’t ideal but it was our reality—the world as it is we needed now to be resolute to keep our feet pointed in the direction of progress

dont give up on your faith just to please someone who has no faith at all

that is like giving up a treasure to please someone who has none

sometimes the hole of despair is just too deep hope cannot reach that low or maybe a person cannot hold on to the edge of hope from inside the crater of despair

as long as this exists and that should be for ever i know that there will be solace for every sorrow whatever the circumstances i firmly believe that nature can bring comfort to all who suffer

excerpt from everlasting

you cant touch hope

but you can feel her

through the breath of angels

and in the faces of those with hope etched in their eyes

the ones that give you something to believe in once more

remember to cherish hope’s rays and her warmth

as she rises through the fire

as a phoenix reborn

like the shape of the rising sun

and the pools of cascading gold

from heavenshigh

as a new dawn wakes to come

so what can we really do for each other exceptjust love each other and be each others witness and havent we got the right to hopefor more so that we can really stretch into whoever we really are

all your failures and hopes your suffering and striving are inconsequential compared with this they are nothing

you are nothing

it was a relief to be nothing it felt deep and beautiful and true

above the dark town

after the suns gone down

two vapour trails cross the sky

catching the days last slow goodbye

black skyline looks rich as velvet

like gold but better

africa’s hopeful transformation lies in entrepreneurship

purgatory is hell with hope

drops of rain fall on my naked skin

they clean my spirit and awake my conscience

they cry with me in a cathartic release

they scream they fight they hurt they heal

excerpted from healed by rain chapter resilience

henry reaches up and touched his brim i’m wearing one right now

nothing is possible without belief you cant step into the potential of possibility without any faith believe that it is possible

in life there are bound to be difficult times dont lose hope keep trying

my cosmic desires freeze in an apocalyptical healing

alleviate my nightmares and calm my deep thunders

excerpted from healed by rain chapter resilience

let the whole universe know

what you are able to do

my soul sings loudly forever changed by love

but releasing every storm from within

feeling exhausted but safe and blessed

and carry joy under the wings of freedom

excerpted from underneath horizons chapter resilience

i want to write about the sun

whose rays of light caress the sea

and under his bliss all the essence breathes

excerpted from underneath horizons chapter resilience

i have just dine on a savory dish that i believe you will find delicious and i am writing to commend it to you i am calling it hope

when your appetite is sharpened by persistent failure and frosty despair a warm bowl of hope is just the thing to set your mind and spirit right

i’ll celebrate the waltz of stars in endless harmony

i’ll dream with my angels in far away lands

and i will send love letters to my future self

excerpted from my kind of resilience chapter resilience

i return to the beginning of time

gathering fallen feathers of the angels’ wings

delighted i breathe the infinite sky

excerpted from healed by rain chapter resilience

i’ll feel the magic in the blissful daylight

i’ll listen to the cheerful songs of nature

and i will heal my soul with joy and love

excerpted from my kind of resilience chapter resilience

i’ll take the sadness in my eyes and bury it into depths

i’ll withstand with courage every shadow of my harmful past

and i will never lose again just learn and win

excerpted from my kind of resilience chapter resilience

the posters…they’re still hanging up

i noticed lance shrugged i thought about taking them down but…i can’t do that it gives them hope believing that maybe someday they’ll see their loved ones again

they’re both a little crazy  both a little messed up but they’re choosing to be messed up together

a rebel how glorious the name sounds when applied to a woman oh rebellious woman to you the world looks in hope upon you has fallen the glorious task of bringing liberty to the earth and all the inhabitants thereof

for i am bound with fleshly bands

joy beauty lie beyond my scope

i strain my heart i stretch my hands

and catch at hope

your conversations help create your world speak of delight not dissatisfaction speak of hope not despair let your words bind up wounds not cause them

if my fondest desires do not exceed my greatest abilities it may be that what i’ve desired is not to desire

she was like a rubiks cube in a blind mans hand  impossible to figure out and yet i was the blind man determined to try

it was little more than a weak flame flickering under the weight of his melancholia but it was there a splinter of possibility maybe he didnt want to die

maybe just maybe he wanted to live

it didnt burn away his sadness it didnt make his future appear any less dark

but it was there—hope perhaps or something like it—and it was enough

it is possible to have a thousand problems and still not have a single valid reason to kill yourself

we were in it together no matter what was to come and we would fight for the win for each other until the last whistle blew

no i dont think poems will save us and yet and yet

if the god who crafted each of those

twinkling stars cared for him like the bible promised everything

would work out he’d just have to have faith  brandon

a journey of life ends when the hope collapses

cancer is never a lethal disease

if your strength of mind wants it to freeze

death will arrive but it loves to wait

when living in hope is never too late

you may know that the peony is jeannins the hollyhock belongs to quost but the sunflower is mine in a way

you may know that the peony is jeannins the hollyhock belongs to quost but the sunflower is mine in a way

but there is no light at the end of the tunnel to see

i think there is no hope left for me

i wonder how many miles i have to walk through

and if there is a miracle coming to hit me somewhere out of the blue …

you will find that joy love and hope are the strongest most elevating emotions in our universe discover for yourself how they can anchor the spirit open your heart and bring to you endless possibilities

hold on keep trying dont give up even when you think you cant

i wear a pair of wings

full of flaws and imperfections

but they are still beautiful enough to spread them and fly

feeling so perfectly unflawed …

hope didnt wait to be attacked hope was a suicidal creature

hey boy regardless of what they do always remember that your hero is in you and there will always be tomorrow

my poetry is a journey in the depth of my heart in the abyss of my conscious underneath this realm and transcending horizons

is who i was who i am and who i had become

the two crucial points about ‘happiness’ are to be satisfied and thankful once you grasp these two mindsets no matter how small and pathetic your life may be it will look perfect in your eyes

i hope youll erase all of your souls mournful songs

and allow me enhance your spirit in a delightful flight of chimeras

faith is embracing the invisible simply because the invisible is the precursor to everything that is visible therefore to lack faith is to lack everything

i chose to

live and make this living worth it

pray with angels and receive their blessing

enjoy the beauty of this mesmerizing world

feel the bliss with every passing morning

hear the calling of my inner beauty

sway in tears of joy and embrace the flight

excerpted from mindfulness

i chose to

float in contentment and forgive all the deep pains

accept the shadows of my queer past

encounter faith and that magic love from within

enrich my spirit with graceful emotions of who i am

listen to the essence of life and collect its charm

cultivate the fascinating practice of spiritual wellbeing

excerpted from mindfulness chapter resilience

i chose to

explore the senses of this delightful universe

breathe the sensations of my body with every move

abandon myself in flow and feel compassion

become aware of my existence

and thank lord for his blessings on me…

excerpted from mindfulness chapter resilience

a glimmer of hope even a small one lingering tantalizingly far in the future can help you face the trials in between

its never foolish to have a dream even if it never comes to be it can give you the hope you need to keep going

maybe maybe there was a way and then things could be so good

my brain was a hopemaking machine

there would always be flashes of beauty even in the midst of pain

hope dies to ten thousand small cuts

shall we do without hope some days

there will be none but now

to the dry and dead woods floor

they come again the first

flowers of the year the assembly

of the faithful the beautiful

wholly given to being

hope isn’t for the weary it’s for the brave

we can depend on the assurance that god cares about us and is always with us

i will always look for what my eyes cain’t see

our sole hope our sole confidence our

only assured promise is your mercy

if i am privileged enough to see an upturn i want to return here with my spirit mended smiling at the most marvelous of scripts ever written

music melts the soul misery

i hoped for one of my people to do this but maybe if you can it will bond you to the land and you’ll be able to rid the white man of his crimes

be idealistic about the future be realistic about the present and never forget the lessons of the past

i welcome injustice because injustice gives me something to strive for we need the darkness for it allows the light to shine god’s greatest gift to mankind is satan because evil gives us something to strive against

why worry why bothering yourself about life challenges some of the problems youre facing can be solved in a tinkle of an eye if you follow the right path and you hold on strongly to your believe

its just that i dont hope any more ive lost my nerve

we truly believed in something back then and we knew we were the kind of people capable of believing in something –with all our hearts and that kind of hope will never simply vanish

be the choice maker of your feelings if youre lost in your emotions just follow your heart

the first step in achieving anything is the belief that you can

keep digging and youll always discover a new low

never give up hope where there is light there is always a way back

never give up on hope

where there is light there is always a way back

hope is not something that you conjure up in your own mind hope is an inspiration you get from the people you are around hope has to be shown and seen hope is something that is developed that’s learned you must see the opportunity for hope

sometimes hope is all we have hope and trust fade by kailin gow

we get past things we keep going that’s what people do celes as long as they keep doing that there’s always hope for the future fade by kailin gow

dont lose faith in humanity there are good people out there you have the power to make a difference

one fine day someone will help you find what you have lost inside of you awhile ago

though darkness now surrounds me

and i cannot see the light

i will trust the purpose i cannot see

i’ll not surrender to the night

but when my other untalented friends and i got together with some instruments it was like our world opened up it was like zero and zero got together and made infinity

the breath of life is the brevity to live

only hope can keep a man alive in times of hardship

godly wisdom guides a man to walk on the good path

i laid my palm on the second square – the woman in the field and the slaves flying in the air over her head all that hope in the wind

when it comes to what god’s doing in our lives sometimes knowing everything kills everything and if i kill everything then knowing everything doesn’t matter

i might not believe in the possibilities but that in no way diminishes the realities of the opportunities

hope is a burden im not sure i can bare anymore

prayer paves the path for progress

the only thing you cannot survive is death

with hope you can strive in any hardship

once in a while you come across someone who will make your life special again

faith is the finest life

lets help the less fortunate

concrete allowed the rose to grow

which goes to show

even the hardest of heads

whose ways and beliefs are set in stone

can spontaneously surprise

uplift and give us hope

expand your consciousness its long overdue

i know youre strong in your views

probably because youve gone through abuse

sincerely sorry for you

but trials and tribulations

teach enough to allow reaching a truce

trust in yourself have faith in yourself have hope be open to possibilities

i believe in miracles because i am surrounded by miracles every day my very existence is a miracle

i stared at the trunks of books on the library floor remembering the pangs i’d once had for a profession for some purpose the world had been such a beckoning place once

jesusauthor of my life nd edition is heightened with healing from the weakest point of view and placing

i have seen so many girls in my life but she is a woman hope to meet her soon

i dream of the

summers we kissed

winters we missed

spring that blossomed

withering of the autumn

with hope in my heart

i dream of getting you back

pessimism is not part of my nature rather it’s part of what happens to me when i reject god’s nature

this is written in the night in war the dark is on nobodys side in love the dark confirms that we are together

peace will only ever be obtained when we realize that our neighbor is really us in a different guise

dad would call it my sisyphus toll push a boulder up a hill pretending it’s okay and come nightfall it  and i  come crashing down but he forgets the view each time i make it to the top

paradise is not something that we create rather it is something that we find

i do my best to put blinders one but its impossible to ignore what is happening around me

if you have the chance take a step

if you have the opportunity build your dream

if you have the mind take every risk

if you have the spirit hold your faith

if you have the time prove your love

if you have the strength walk alone

if you have the guts show your result

truly the only time we have is now

why christmas we ask ourselves it’s because whatever’s staring back at us in the mirror is the very same thing that’s emblazoned across god’s heart

the sun always rises unless youre on a space station i guess

real life can never have a written lie all over it

it’s not about believing in something rather it’s about what i believe in and too often what i believe in is that there’s nothing to believe in

hoping is not dreaming it is not spinning an illusion or fantasy to protect us from our boredom or our painit is imagination put in the harness of faith

you are not for any reason less than whom god created you to be dont live like a dwarf where you are seen as a giant

if ingenuity is an indicator of how much we love someone then the story of christmas is about as ingenious as you can get

christmas is god’s way of saying that we’re great just not in the arrogant way that we think we are

christmas and hope are bound inseparable but because we can’t separate ourselves from our need to deny such a truth we’ve bound ourselves to live without hope

with hope in our heart we shall forever be happy

milton had a day to day outlook if life were not at any given moment positively unbearable that is to say if he were not actually cold nor without a drink nor alone he still maintained a vivid faith in the future

without the mercy of god how could we have a merry heart

we all have a dream for what this life could be like christmas is god handing us everything that we need to make that dream a reality the issue is are we willing to take up ‘everything’ or let our dreams fall to ‘nothing

we all have a dream for what this life could be like christmas is god handing us everything that we need to make that dream a reality the issue is are we willing to take up that ‘everything’ or let our dreams fall to ‘nothing

your sorrow is your sorrow

believe in god that is the only brevity of life

in the silient of his heart he knows his sufferings

is there anything like faith

compassion removes the walls of mistrust and builds bridges of hope trust and beliefs

it is not a matter of being broken even though i am in fact quite shattered it is understanding that my capacity to be fixed always exceeds the extent to which i’m broken

we are so much more than just our physical selves

being thankful reminds us that if it’s broken it’s an opportunity

the sky was dark and cold as she longed for the one man who could chase away the demons of the night

a good wife behaves like a disciple unto her husband

love came to me as the touching waves kissing my feet but never to stay i wondered its existence until i got absorbed into it

by nature we are creatures of hope always ready to be deceived again caught by the marvel that might be wrapped in the grubbiest brown paper parcel

keep your hopes up high maintaining the positivity in you if you think you are worth it then go and get it prove it to yourself everybody else did it and so can youtell yourself you can and so you will  kacyc

lover is a mere companion love is eternal

gavin is just a kid he hasnt figured out yet how cruel life can be how it can take everything from you dig in its sharp teeth and not let go he still has hope i cant tarnish that

hope is a terrible thing it brings fear that the hope won’t be realized suppress the fear and it surfaces as symbol

the longer i’ve walked with god the more i’ve realized that being thankful is vigorously celebrating what’s right in the world while anticipating that what’s wrong with it will soon follow suit

everyone is born an artist what differentiates us are the variations of creativity

don’t be afraid of exploring your capabilities of seeking adventures of searching for answers of pushing the envelope of finding gaps between the fences don’t be afraid period life is too short to be a wimp

faith is hope with assurance

when talk about hopei want to be a beacon of hope to my family but i really need to save just a little for myself to do so i need to triple up my effort ejump

we look at the coming of a new beginning like we look at the coming of babies we never considered aborting hopeful

one of the most dangerous things in life is a sickened person that has lost all hope for the future

the other side the other side always seemed so far away we had hope but like the acolyte who had to reassemble herself before dawn we were unsure if we could do what was being asked

a positive attitude is more important than skills

some would say that paradise is the escapist ‘fiction’ of hapless minds caught up in the denial of a darkening world but christmas would say that the ‘paradise’ of escapist fiction has not a single shred of fiction in it at all

hope follows on the heels of faith and the whitewinged goddess—which is hope—did not leave her but prompted her to many little surreptitious acts of preparation in the event of the miracle coming to pass

but by now anything was better than hope

like a painting you are art and i hope i can be a piece of it

as i’d found time and again throughout my life—and would continue to find—you do what you can say your prayers and hope for the best

dreams are their own knife kaylin dreams whatifs desires we all have to have hope

spending time with god will fill vacant places in our lives

give your bain vitamin h

hope is te most powerful supplement available to us and thankfully we can make hope for ourselves any time just by changing our thoughts and attitudes

others words can only affect us if we give them worth with our reaction

by remembering that its usually the ones who are hurting that hurt others

we are all searching in the darkness

holding out our hand ready to hold each other againwhen we learn to forgive

if you feel something consistently it’s because you’ve fed it continually think

she was twisted with a crazy anxiety mixed with a crazy hope

people dont need hope to be happy they need something to do

dont give up dont loose hope dont settle for less and keep finding answers better days ahead get out of those mess get those things out of your head

reading gives us information writing exercises our emotions

how is everything nadia he said

its hot i replied smiling a little bit

its very hot nasser its very hot

cemeteries are full of bodies that despair has enslaved

on the fifth day things began to improve hope was a tiny red fish wiggling through a wide black slowmoving river under a dark sky shannon leaned over the bow of an old splintered rowboat adrift in the water in order to greet it

every day magic and beauty awaits us

when we look with the eyes of love

i’d much rather have all of this be the ‘pigment’ of my imagination rather than a ‘figment’ for at least it would all have some color

as theologians we must say more than we can be in the hope that others will make us more than we are what is crucial is that we not write to justify the limits of our lives

hope is not some flimsy belief that things might somehow work out rather hope is a belief in a god who’s already worked it out

he who wishes for anything but christ does not know what he wishes he who asks for anything but christ does not know what he is asking he who works and not for christ does not know what he is doing

imbuing life with some element of magic gave him hope hope that there was a reason for all things hope that the future was even now learning from the mistakes of the past

she knew at times like this she was an anchor for him a reminder that there was light and life in between the darkness and drying

no poet ever wrote a poem to dishonor life to compromise high ideals to scorn religious views to demean hope or gratitude to argue against tenderness to place rancor before love or to praise littleness of soul not one not ever

that ole devil hes always tryin to mess up our lives make us quit hopin but hes the biggest liar they is thats what the good book says

hope persists and its voice is compassion and honest doubt

i will be waiting for you at the end of every blind alley under the lonely streetlamps of a city that will no longer be ours

when the wind grows colder and the huge piles of settled leaves sit there for a week or two unshielded from the curious gaze of passersby i will be waiting for you

i will be waiting for what could have been and for what will never be

for the letters that never arrived the letters that were never sent and the letters that will never be written

this is the shadow of hope knowing that we may never see the realization of our dreams and yet still showing up

yet what is expectation but a kind of folly and what is that folly but an excess of hope

a hug is hope in disguise

just when it seems as if trouble is set to destroy your hope future or family gods resurrection power can help you rise above it all

youll get with faith and hope what you think can be yours

rachel do people like you ever have wishes jonathan

jonathan what does that mean people like me

rachel people who have everything was there ever something you wanted but could only wish for jonathan something for the future that you want but don’t think you’ll get

rachel don’t tell me that’ll ruin it

jonathan what do you mean by wish then rachel

rachel like hope you get something you know is impossible but hope anyway

jonathan i wish i could be with you like a normal person

rachel what’s normal to someone like you

rachel do you wish for things you can’t buy

jonathan you’re fascinated with money

rachel i think i am it’s made you different you know you’re fearless it’s exciting kind of watching you is like watching someone who’s really truly free

jonathan what do you wish for besides money

rachel free jonathan i wish to be free

in our darkest hours in when we must look up to our highest almighty god he is calling for you to be your best self now nothing is holding you back go for it

makestrong old dreams lest this our world lose heart

so many things we ask for hope for prayers put out into the world so wide there was no way they could all be answered but you had to keep asking if you didnt nothing even had a chance of coming true

the first world war had finally come to a close and it all seemed like springtime ive learned since that it is in those moments when one is lulled into hopefulness that the sword drops onto ones head

if your love had a song what would it be could you soul continuously thrive without its rhythm

if your love had a song what would it be could your soul continuously thrive without its rhythm

love when everything seems hopeless smile when youre feeling discouraged give even if it means being fearless and hope in all things god has created be beautiful

i keep planting my smile in the rich soil of your sadness hoping one day love will bloom from your thoroughly saturated heart

let your tears fall on the seeds of sorrow for tomorrow love shall bloom

hope is born out of an active response to what is offered

i am not quiltyand i am not going to plead guiltywhen i did not do it

we cry from pain from loss and from loneliness but mostly we cry because we still have hope and because we can still find joy even on the darkest and coldest of winter nights

sometimes a story is all you have she coralee says sometimes that can be enough

hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness

how wonderful it is those people that we meet by chance and invite us to live again

the memory of them will keep hope alive forever

you have creative control in this life choose love over fear choose hope over despair

never underestimate the infinite love within you

it has the power to transform lives

trust what you feel

there are so many ways the heart speaks to us

if if if this all happened i f  he had to hang on to those two little letters just one tiny two letter word if so much hope and dread hung in the balance on those two little blips in the alphabet a chasm in fact

everyone we meet has wounds upon their heart

everyone is waiting for someone to scatter the seeds of love amongst their tears and to be patient enough to wait for their beautiful fragrance of dreams to awaken once more

a person can suffer from a lack of dreams

when the odds are impossible  do the impossible

may you thrive where others tumble

nothing changes love ever hope is a fickle vixen sent to torment us with discontent and i am done with her and her empty promises and wishes unfulfilled

it wasnt enough but it was a start it might keep him going

take comfort in a light only darkness provides

his lone breaths everywhere to be with him

hope survives one more day losing all fear

with the cold nights touch through shivered scheme

his new day reminds of another year

from the poem sonnet for a man part ii

hope isnt poison lissa hope is the thing that keeps you going when everything is awful and dark and you dont know which way to turn

im still doing it im still doing the thing i never do im hoping or at least im trying on hope for size

hope was a cold hearted mistress who promised a dozen wonderful things and didnt deliver a single one of them

match that love trying to stay alive in your hunger

what is a stratosphere fourteen miles from

the earth or a sunken glass house on

the seabottom amid fish and feather

stars unless a bet that man can shove

on beyond yesterdays record of man

the hoper the believer

his chest rises and falls heavily his thumb stroking my cheekbon and he finally tells me dum spiro spero

never give up hope as long as there is breath in your body theres always opportunity for change

be sensitive to those around you sometimes they could be silent but screaming for help from within

happiness depends not on things around me but on my attitude

we are all spawned from the same great canvas yet we lose ourselves through the melding of vistas

if any of this ended in an explosion i hoped it would be one that made us burn brighter stronger than ever before

rainbows are full of love peace dreams  hopes

but hope like heroes can prove hard to kill

slaves hung on determinedly to their selves to their love of family their wholeness a shoemaker on the south carolina sea islands expressed in his own way ise lost an arm but it hasnt gone out of my brains

i am supposing or perhaps only hoping that our future may be found in the pasts fugitive moments of compassion rather than in its solid centuries of warfare

because hope survives best at the hearth i said guard it for me and i wont be tempted to give up again

poets soar on the wings of hope

hope and breath stay and breathe together with entire life

i hope he would say i will not disappoint him too badly for becoming … the things i have become

was it wrong to hope to be happy

smile to begin a friendship

hug and handclasp to lift a soul

your hope can raise up their spirits

one touch can show that you care

the monument of a great man is not of granite or marble or bronze it consists of his goodness his deeds his love and compassion

no better words than thank you have yet been discovered to express the sincere gratitude of ones heart when the two words are sincerely spoken

there is always a way always

there is always a way always

life is not what happens to us is how we react to what happens to us

voice up to let out wisdom

stand up for what is true

your life can create a difference

its certainly up to you

it is easy to enter every moment of a day so burdened down as we try to carry all of our hopes and fears for that day that we miss the good in every moment every moment is worth investing a full moment in

walt whitman said i am not contained between my hat and my boots we are not contained between our fears and our past experiences either

no positive effort is so small that good things won’t come from it so do it

do you keep looking for fault in everything

that is what you will find

do you keep looking for cruelty in people around you

youll never find the good in them

when you stop looking for the shadows the light you will see

we must meet the challenge rather than wish it were not before us

do not find or create a story that limits you

when its hard to to get through another hour and another minute refuse to believe the lies of darkness make a conscious decision to focus on light and practice gratitude for what you have

happiness is something that happy people are always looking to increase or amplify while those lacking it are always trying to find

i can breathe where there is green green grows hope it keeps my heart beating and helps me remember who i am

all that had gone before was not a thousandth of what was yet to come the story of this star had barely begun

even in the darkest times the gods are always there

adoption every child a wanted child there are  million orphans in the world waiting for someone to want them could one of them be waiting for you

if you decide to walk for others be prepared to carry them for many miles

embrace your imperfections we are not machines

i cant stand to hope unless theres a reason to

something shed done since the first  she kept him from yielding to the dark lure of the water until he could see for himself the hope found in the dawn of each new day

the freed self searches for the bright star that unlocks the doors of peace and rebirth

what you feel with determined

if there is hope happiness will come

finding its way through your heart

if there is hope love will be present

caressing your soul with its warmth

if there is hope dreams will be true

fulfilling your craziest thoughts

and if there is hope there is a goal

waiting to be achieved

our words may not cause plants to sprout but they can make hope spring forth in a human heart

a son’s prayer

help my dad

he sure needs it

we all have the power to make little choices that can change the course of our lives forever

looking for a mystery

to take over your life

sit down with some small detail

let it settle like cream

in your coffee swirling

and wonder when you rise

you will walk another step

and not some other

the rest of your life

river most mighty

waiting for the sun to melt

theres no better medicine for the soul that knowing you arent alone

theres no better medicine for the soul than knowing you arent alone

find your soul

and keep it in your heart

feed it honor it

for what it is your presence

in this world open

that great family reunion in heaven awaits the child of god

warm someones cheek

kiss for  seconds or more or for the rest of your life

be there

be loyal

be love

be with someone always

belong to yourself

what mckenna possessed was far more beguiling than mere physical beauty she possessed a kindness a generosity of spirit offering him the most dangerous thing of all  hope

play a childrens game

open your mind

expand your patience

kiss the children

when the fear of losing out pains you only a heavenly touch can sustain

despair not refuse to be gloomy or negative dont allow challenges and situations to rob your joy do not allow anything or anyone to take your peace away

we all deserve to experience genuine happiness and can easily do so

i’m learning to make things nice for myself i’m learning to save myself

i’m trying as i always will

for the briefest moment ulla despised signy as we can only hate those who rescue us from loneliness

evils something you can decide to do every day and it gets easier every time but the more good you bring into the world maybe the more the rest of the world would look like this like paradise

i feel a swell of pride this this right here is why i wanted to become a teacher to know that it is possible to change the world for the better in however small a way

dangling form the traps steel teeth by his wounded leg a lesser creature might have closed his eyes and prayed for nothing more than a quick death but if koja had words then he had hope

my life might be in the streets but my heart is gold and together im a street of gold

the sun will rise again the only uncertainty is whether or not we will rise to greet it

alan christensens diary

when the results are not there work when the results are there work

hope grows like a flower when someone in need knows that you care

hope was a dangerous thin it filled you up it made you believe in things you might never have but could not give up on

hope is important it allows you to survive

but theres a point where tough love is required if you want to change

action is necessary it allows you to live

and even though i didnt know this exact moment existed i wanted to be out here in the world to see it

hope is the last thing a man should ever lose

sometimes the grass is not greener on the other side and we should stay in the field where we belong and sometimes we just need to take a gamble and hope for the best

a problem cannot be solved without understanding it

dream up ways to allow your freedom to not be anchored to a job

do not let the things that try to steal your peace rob you of your joy do not give them the permission to scare you into no performance

does this not tell you that grief as well as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond

hope is the escapist drug of the hopeless

sometimes it takes more courage to believe in what you can’t see she said quietly and then looked into his dark blue eyes because anyone can believe in what’s already been proven

grace willows not a ghost of a chance

there were countless injustices and difficulties in this world but small points of light too where the darkness was held back

there has to be uncomfortable element in the discourse of anything to change

she looks at me ‘no other test is required maybe you can take a pill’

‘what kind of pills’

she looks at me tenderly ‘chill pill…’ and follows it with a wink

god allows problems to disrupt our space so he can fit in

my desire since adolescence to have a personal relationship with jesus was coming true and my heart beat hard with excitement

its the trying that heals you thats all you have to do just try

my highest aspiration is to love without limits and without ego

a fighter never gives up his scars are his ornaments he may never be whole yet he’s bigger than all his battles and beautiful even in his brokenness

look ahead to the bright light

use your hopes to unfold each night

rejoice in the struggle stay sane

there’s always sunshine after rain

you see i was my own monster when you don’t have hope something can grow inside of you that will just keep hurting biting snarling and you can sink farther and let that monster overtake you

some people don’t fight back they might hurt others hurt themselves or just—relinquish the fight for happiness

i believe  i believe that if there was a start to this then there has to be an end

selfawareness is the capacity to recognise that you are a separate entity from others

it is not how long we spend with someone that matters

its the effect of that encounter that makes the difference

every shadow of doubt is cast from a candle of hope

you only fail when you stop trying

god can set my destiny but he cant take my decisions

i think that is not true uncle henrik said i think you are like your mamaand like your papa and like me frightened but determined and if the time came to be brave i quite sure you would be very very brave

but he added it is much easier to be brave if you do not know everything and so your mama does not know everythingneither do i we only know what we need to know

do you understand what i am saying he asked looking into her eyes

annemarie frowned she wasnt surewhat did bravery mean she had been very frightened the daynot long ago though now it seemed far in the past when the soldier had stopped her on the street and asked questions in his rough voice

meghan markle just singlehandedly gave all divorced women more hope

if you dont want anyone to find out dont do it

when you make a commitment you build hope when you keep it you build trust

she always picks the most boring things on the rack always in basic black if its shaped like a sack even better

maybe it feels easier that way just being invisible instead of always worrying what people think of you

nims voice was surprisingly emphatic but thats a choice too right because people are always going to look theyre always going to judge so you can say nothing or you can at least answer back

the more you do it the easier it will be to repeat it if you have many successes it’s easier to have them again

your dream is always valid until you lose moral to chase it

one has to hope you know’

when god gives me a plan i dont fit my plan between his plan i scrap my plan

she was grateful her life regained a new purpose a new rhythm and focus

nature has buffered out children not only physicallyprepubescent children have the lowest death rate from all causes but psychologically as well by endowing them with hope abundant and irrational

nature has buffered our children not only physically prepubescent children have the lowest death rate from all causes but psychologically as well by endowing them with hope abundant and irrational

there’s always a way so i always try

make hope just like water in your life

he smiles a little this is the point of being a teacher a glimmer of hope where you thought it didnt exist

hope thin as a thread sharp as a fishing line cut into davids heart p

birthday marks the beginning of a new year new hopes and new dreams so we should never blow out the candle before cutting the cake on such a day let the candle burn let it spread light everywhere

i won’t lose hope i won’t be broken

she looks up into the darkening sky she knows shell never stop hoping never stop searching the stars wondering whether any of them could be the one abel someday calls home

we are each others miracles

somewhere there is a man who is not afraid to live in a womans hope

blossoms of hope bloom every day not like other blossoms just in the month of may

and all i can think about is that its not over and im tired and im ready to go but im still here and i have to do it again and again and again he leaned back in his chair

you think about that before you tell me ive got it easy

i stayed silent a while before speaking so why dont you end it

if your life is such a hell i asked why bother why go through it again and again and all those times

because of he stopped and looked at the ceiling after a moment he shrugged

because of children he said because of smiles and sunshine and ice cream

youve got to be kidding

you dont like ice cream elijah shook his head its the best imagine how excited i was when someone finally invented it

sunshine and smiles dont make all that other stuff go away i said this isnt a fairy land

you dont do any of those things

but i have my memories said elijah and i have even simpler things music food everybody likes bacon

im a vegetarian

asparagus then said elijah roasted in pan a little olive oil and a little salt  you the get the most incredible flavor  almost like a nut but deep and rich and the textures just perfect

ive tried it

i dont see how thats any of your business

a first kiss is important most people only get one but i can remember a hundred thousand of them how could i give that up he shook his dead smiling for the first time the world never gets old john

but time is a cruel mistress and it was not until much years later that she would learn the truth that there is no such thing as salvation an escape is only ever an illusion conjured up by the hopeful

having faith is bravery faith requires no evidence just tremendous strength of spirit and a mind that conquers doubt

god will take your good bad and ugly and create a masterpiece

the purest worship is to simply love  to see the image of god in every human to love them as they are how they are who they are  without demand without condition without fear

be the best you and not defy yourself by the standards of others

you cant make sense out of nonsense

abuse changes who we are it changes who we become it changes how we move in the world and so does kindness

this isnt the end you know he said nothing ever is nothing ever will be  not even judgment day

in hell hope is a really really bad habit like smoking cigarettes or fingernail biting hope is something really tough and tenacious you have to give up its an addiction to break

lifes hardest teachings yield the most beautiful lessons

when you have hope then you become a blessing to someone else

let your faith be bigger than your fears

as you know six nights a week we gather together to sing songs we know and love to dance to escape our daily lives but on the seventh night … god created yiddish theater

sometimes we close our eyes to things hoping people will change

i realized that as imperfect as i may be i am the perfect nick vujicic

however desperate your life may seem there is hope and no matter how dire your circumstances may appear you can rise above them

i love you from the waist down i dont deal in damaged goods

good luck to us all

and may we meet again on distant shores

some place fine and far from here

when life feels too big to handle go outside everything looks smaller when youre standing under the sky

i have found it always better to hope than despair

leave a trail of light behind you

everywhere you go

whose darkness youll illuminate

you may never know

belief is hope with an attitude that will not quit

i want work that is a relentless oasis

i am not who i was i am not even who i was yesterday tomorrow i will be new again and again until i am completely the woman i was meant to be

it takes lives to save lives

if there is any period one would desire to be born in ⎯ is it not the age of revolution when

how amazing these words are that slowly come to me

how wonderfully on and on they go

will the words end i ask

whenever i remember to

nope my sister says all of five years old

now

and promising me

the arch of history may be long but it never bends away from reality

is not the circumstances but your attitude of gratitude faith and grace that will bring you serendipity and good fortune everyday

god doesnt love me the way i deservehe loves me the way he desires

geyer and gary looked at each other and wearily sat down all the weeks of travel in the hottest months of the year investigating lead after lead alternating between faith hope discouragement and despair

the arch of history may be long but it bends away from reality

the night before she had thought the last of her hopes dried up and yet the sun had risen again this morning and in the path of its warm rays she had discovered one final blossom

the path to hell is that of good intentions and nothing comes to a sleeper except dreams so keep your good intentions in focus and make those dreams come true

the only and last words she remembered her mother told her before she became mute was

but mom why should we live a long life when it’s a very bad time to live and many bad people want to kill us

because your innocent dreams still have colors and power and we have to keep them that way

our pain can be turned to purpose

experience is the benefit of the past

opportunity is the benefit of the present

hope is the benefit of the future

live your best life right now at this exact moment you cant fix the future harboring on yesterdays mistakes

hope when it is between you and the rest of the world

just do it when it is between you and yourself

hope when it is between you and the rest of the world

challenge just do it when it is between you and yourself

my hope is in god therefore i am helped

hindsight is a dangerous game

i will keep falling deep down into my abyss

until my chaos turns it into an art scene

you carry too much hope and it will canker in your soul like an infection

so i died many times that year

in the cold in the storm on the run or on the drunk for my heart did not want to beat

but kept on beating anyway

and my pain was as real as real can be

and i tried to learn and deal and run and feel

but nothing really worked

my pessimism and cynicism knows no bounds nothing truly surprises me these days but when that little spark of optimism of hope is alight it burns really brightly in the darkness

i keep falling deep down into my dark abyss…

at some point my abyss will turn into a horizon…

every man’s insomnia is as different from his neighbor’s as are their daytime hopes and aspirations

however the sun himself is weak when he first rises and gathers strength and courage as the day gets on

it was too loud for hope

it was too silent for victory

even a broken watch is correct twice a day

as environments change no human ideal standeth sure

gather around me oh ye deathdefiant and the earth itself shall be thine to have and to hold

too long the dead hand has been permitted to sterilize living thought

too long right and wrong good and evil have been inverted by false prophets

i question all things as i stand before the festering and varnished facades of your haughtiest moral dogmas i write thereon in letters of blazing scorn lo and behold all this is fraud

he that is slow to believe anything and everything is of great understanding for belief in one false principle is the beginning of all unwisdom

behold the crucifix what does it symbolize pallid incompetence hanging on a tree

whenever therefore a lie has built unto itself a throne let it be assailed without pity and without regret for under the domination of an inconvenient falsehood no one can prosper

i blast out the ghastly contents of philosophically whited sepulchers and laugh with sardonic wrath

i gaze into the glassy eye of yoursome god and pluck him by the beard i uplift a broadaxe and split open his wormeaten skull

i raise up in stern invasion the standard of the strong

no hoary falsehood shall conventions that do not lead to my earthly success and happiness

before none of your printed idols do i bend in acquiescence he who saith thou shalt not to me is my mortal foe

i request reason for your golden rule and ask the why and wherefore of your commandments

for i stand forth to challenge the wisdom of the world to interrogate the laws of man and you

now i lay me down to sleep

i pray the lord my soul to keep

if i should die before i wake

i pray the lord my soul to take

in this arid wilderness of steel and stone i raise up my voice that you may hear to the east and to the west i beckon to the north and to the south i show a sign proclaiming death to the weakling wealth to the strong

open your eyes that you may see oh men of mildewed minds and listen to me ye bewildered millions

god is my helper so i have hope

she stood for a moment looking up at the stars so far so many bright and cold and with a faint smile she thought ‘i wonder which is my lucky star

dont ever let that feeling that you were meant to do great things turn out to be a lie

it doesnt matter what my life has been like samir what matters is hope if you dont believe in a happy ending what are you living for

fall in love with yourself

because the one

youve been searching for

so desperately

is you

as long as you can look fearlessly at the sky youll know that youre pure within and will find happiness once more

riches prestige everything can be lost but the happiness in your own heart can only be dimmed it will always be there as long as you live to make you happy again

as long as this exists and that should be forever i know that there will be solace for every sorrow whatever the circumstances i firmly believe that nature can bring comfort to all who suffer

to surrender now is to pay the expensive ogre twice

ancient woods of my blood dash down to the nut of the seas

if i take to burn or return this world which is each mans work

or something very ordinary that most people take for granted

love was never a mistake even when it wasnt returned

she is in love with herself and every ounce of it

your soul remains intact waiting to save you

the whole universe came together to consummate a wonderful soul you

the winds of change blow over the sea of hope as we ride the heavens high above

forever searching for the isle of dreams forever looking forever scanning the horizon

but for most of us its in vain it would seem for the isle of hope is nowhere to be seen

but for some a glimpse is enough to stretch out ones hand and snatch at its thread

its all it takes its all you need for if you do it youre sure to succeed

within you exists an abundance of love

rise above your imprisoned mind

and attempt to spread the love

it’s been days now that you did not reply

have started to lose hope again

so writing again

not for the reply

but a hope

a hope for your reply

maybe just maybe

its difficult to find solace

in one another in anyone or anywhere

because everyone is hurting at the same time

hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing

if youre wandering

or astray

surrender to your soul

it only has its arms open for you

there are snippets of hope shining

in the darkest corners of chaos

you must not be scared

refrain from letting fear cover your eyes

life is a jungle and we may not always have a map for it sometimes it is for the best

to get lost and make a house of hope in the middle of nowhere and let the sky and the stars lead you wherever your soul desires

hope itself is light enough to illuminate the dark paths

i am most valuable bill in his wallet

but a torn bill…

in the void of your absence

looking at your empty chair

a dream an illusion

someone who is mine

is not present here

your arrival

will wake me up

and break my illusions

hope is faith holding out its hand in the dark

there’s a glimmer of hope building inside me lighting me up in a way that’s been dark and dormant

only those who show up have a right to speak up

life is a jungle and we may not always have a map for it sometimes it is for the best to get lost and make a house of hope in the middle of nowhere and let the sky and the stars lead you

wherever your soul desires

hope itself is light enough to illuminate the dark paths

gods promises for your life may not happen in your timeline but it will surely happen in your lifetime

trust the magic of new beginnings they fly on the high spirits of faith and hope

forgiveness is the four leafed clover of life

we are survivors we shall survive again and we shall be the strongest most gentle people on this earth

it’s an ugly world and we need to take what happiness we can when we can

i am unknown so what

this verses believe they love they hope thats enough

allow your choices to reflect your hopes not your fears your future depends on it

if i have faith what i see as a wall in front of me is in reality a door that will soon be behind me

in an attempt to fix a crooked world she broke herself her heart and her sanity

the flower of fertility of new things and old seasons to be cradled

despite how dark it might be what is tonight but the precursor to tomorrow

your mind drinks up whatever you pour into it pour hope pour truth pour love pour happiness

hope as it turned out dwindled like sand through an hourglass

who knew such belongings

that the truest love

the margins of life

into forgotten wants

i don’t understand oraeyn whispered hoarsely

it is not for us to understand ina replied her face clearing as she listened to kaitryn it is for us to travel to the very edge of the light we are given

and then oraeyn asked

a radiant smile beamed across kaitryn’s face and then we jump with swords drawn a battlecry on our lips and we beat back the darkness

even in the midst of darkness there is always a shard of light if we will but search for it hard enough and believe in it strongly enough

let me stand for love in conflict let me be peace in tragedy let me be hope in darknes let me be light in grief let me be comfort

dream big love large and live humbly

light is somewhere at the end to guide you not to blind you

despite how dark it might be what is tonight but the precursor to tomorrow

continuing bonds are not an alternative to griefwork but more a result of it

whence dreams are begotten

where sacrifices are extolled

where the invisible light glorifies labor

thence come my blessings

in the whispering of leaves

in the splash of waves

in the murmur of the breeze

i am with you

amidst the cruel and the dark ones

amidst treason of the spirit

amidst strife and sorrow

my shield is over you

wherever you go in life go with love in your heart hope in your soul and joy in your mind for love hope and joy will take you far

our gestures will not erase karma

our shield will protect you against the assaults of the dark forces

but the settlement of old accounts in unavoidable

the hand of fate leads towards the good

carry the light and do not look back

a wish was not truly a wish until it was properly wished

all we have is now and our promise to make it better

once there was magic wandering free

in roads of sky and paths of sea

and in that timeless long gone hour

doors still flew and birds still talked

witches grinned and giants walked

we had magic wands and magic wings

and we lost our hearts to impossible things

for wizards and warriors might be friends

in a world where impossible things are true i dont know why we forgot the spell

when we lost the way

how the forest fell

but now we are old we can vanish too

and i see once more the invisible track

that will lead us home and take us back

so find your wands and spread your wings

ill sing your love of impossible things

and when you take my vanished hand well both go back to that magic land

where we lost our hearts

when we were wizards once

the dream i dream for you my child

i hope you search for fourleaf clovers

breathe in the springtime breezes

and dance with summer loons

i hope you gaze in wideeyed wonder

at the buzzing firefly

and rest beneath the sunlit trees

as butterflies fly by

i hope you gather simple treasures

of pebbles twigs and leaves

and marvel at the fragile web

the tiny spider weaves

i hope you read poetry and fairy tales

and sing silly madeup songs

and pretend to be a superhero

righting this worlds wrongs

i hope your days are filled with magic

and your nights with happy dreams

and you grow up knowing that happiness

the dream i dream for you my child

as you discover learn and grow

is that you find these simple joys

wherever in life you go

though hope be courteous and debonair shes never certain

if i’m only looking at an ending i’ll assume that an ending is all that there is and without a doubt that kind of assumption is the beginning of the end

the future at least had the advantage of not being the present and the worse can always take a turn for the better for strange though it may seem she had faith composed of fine organic matter she existed pure and simple

forgiveness isnt telling someone

it was okay to hurt you

its telling yourself

it’s okay to stop hurting

it doesn’t mean you have

to trust them again

it means you can learn

to trust yourself again

it doesn’t mean you have to give

them a free pass back into your life

it means you are free to

take your life back again

emptying your past of its power

to empty your present of its peace

the only way to heal from the pain

of the past is to walk through that pain

in the present its terrifying i know

it feels safer to just let the pain continue

to smolder in the darkest parts of yourself

but the dark parts need tending too my friend

dont be afraid to breathe life back into those

embers of old pain to rekindle the fires of

unhealed hurts the flames arent there to burn

you they are there to light your way through

pain to healing you can walk through courageous

and confident or shaking in your boots it doesnt

matter just walk through it hurt will transform

into hope wounds into wisdom suffering into

scars that tell of battles won and lost and of a

human who survived it all

i can live a life anticipating beginnings or survive a life dreading endings so maybe i should begin ending the dreading

a sudden thought shocked him to the bone i could leave carthak when im a master id never have to think about the games again

and when the world tells you to lower your head and submit in silence to how things are and always will be lift your voice instead and sing bravely of how things can and should and will be because that song is why you are here

sweet hours have perished here

this is a mighty room

within its precincts hopes have played—

now shadows in the tomb

every shining jewel comes from a crushing it never knew it could survive theres good waiting for you

an act of kindness does not show weakness instead it exalts love for your brotherssisters  humanity

the degree of the darkness that we’re experiencing today is nothing more than an indicator of how bright the coming light is going to be and if we look at it that way does it ever really get that dark

each time we say yes to our fears and vulnerabilities we move closer to our hopes and strengths

sometimes look at life thinking the easy way is always the wrong way and the hard way is always the right way but yet still that doesn’t include the being patient and understanding way

we write in hope and faith to god

as night falls let the days troubles slip away into

the darkness and rest well knowing tomorrow

brings a new day a new chance to do things better

a new opportunity to make things right and when

the new day dawns awaken a little wiser a little older

a little more prepared for the future thats simply

the pattern of life my friends a tapestry of light

threaded with darkness laughter threaded with tears

hope threaded with despair wisdom threaded with

failure insight threaded with regret its just how

we learn and grow as humans and thats okay

its enough to end each day knowing weve done

our best and well do our best again tomorrow

this could be a cure for the very thing that could cause our extinction

he wanted to enslave himself in something so he could set himself free

uncertainties are a certainty in life

they boost up the air of negativity that suffocates

in such times

faith is the insulation

and

hope the oxygen

faith in the universe’s loving intentions

and

hope in their timely fulfilment

sometimes you find hope sometimes hope finds you

they know death is always a danger with my job but they put it out of their minds and hope it will never happen to the person they care about

with tears in my eyes petra cecilia maria hermans
