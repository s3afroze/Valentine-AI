hear the sledges with the bells

what a world of merriment their melody foretells

how they tinkle tinkle tinkle

in the icy air of night

while the stars that oversprinkle

all the heavens seem to twinkle

with a crystalline delight

to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells

from the bells bells bells bells

from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells

hear the mellow wedding bells

what a world of happiness their harmony foretells

through the balmy air of night

how they ring out their delight

from the molten  golden notes

and all in tune

what a liquid ditty floats

to the turtle  dove that listens while she gloats

on the moon

oh from out the sounding cells

what a gush of euphony voluminously wells

how it swells

how it dwells

on the future  how it tells

of the rapture that impels

to the swinging and the ringing

of the bells bells bells

of the bells bells bells bells

to the rhyming and the chiming of the bells

hear the loud alarum bells

what a tale of terror now their turbulency tells

in the startled ear of night

how they scream out their affright

too much horrified to speak

they can only shriek shriek

out of tune

in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire

in a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire

with a desperate desire

and a resolute endeavor

now  now to sit or never

by the side of the pale  faced moon

oh the bells bells bells

what a tale their terror tells

how they clang and clash and roar

what a horror they outpour

on the bosom of the palpitating air

yet the ear it fully knows

by the twanging

and the clanging

how the danger ebbs and flows

yet the ear distinctly tells

in the jangling

and the wrangling

how the danger sinks and swells

by the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells

of the bells

of the bells bells bells bells

in the clamor and the clanging of the bells

hear the tolling of the bells

what a world of solemn thought their monody compels

in the silence of the night

how we shiver with affright

at the melancholy menace of their tone

for every sound that floats

from the rust within their throats

is a groan

and the people  ah the people

they that dwell up in the steeple

all alone

and who tolling tolling tolling

in that muffled monotone

feel a glory in so rolling

on the human heart a stone

they are neither man nor woman

they are neither brute nor human

they are ghouls

and their king it is who tolls

and he rolls rolls rolls

a paean from the bells

and his merry bosom swells

with the paean of the bells

and he dances and he yells

to the paean of the bells

of the bells

to the throbbing of the bells

of the bells bells bells

to the sobbing of the bells

as he knells knells knells

to the rolling of the bells

of the bells bells bells

to the tolling of the bells

of the bells bells bells bells

to the moaning and the groaning of the bells

black friday doesn’t even cover love and happiness they come from within and outside is without without the former

happiness goes beyond the stretch of your lips heart strings can play happy but the soul of the heart is the truth of happiness

beauty starts with a new dawn each and every day

six years of uninterrupted happiness had rolled away since my brothers marriage the sound of war had been heard affording objects of comparison

the biggest problem of a person who has no difficulty in ensuring his own happiness is this the unhappiness of others because it is very difficult to maintain happiness among unhappiness

one of ecstasy’s main ingredients is finding happiness in the tedious

im not looking for happiness but im not looking for an ending either

few things are more important than learning how to learn

start your own circle⁣

if you want to reclaim your life start by reclaiming your time

don’t find meaning assign meaning

lack of love is not usually the culprit in an unhappy marriage but lack of friendship a truly happy couple are those who discover that they are each other’s best friend

dont trade your happy life in for a sad life because tragedy is happening simultaneously take a moment to think on that statement⁣

what are you trading your life for where is your time really going you have freedom but are you free remove selfimposed chains

ways to approach a joyful life

life is short so don’t pretend like you’ll have time later⁣

design your work so have freedom of geography income and time⁣

don’t care about stuff ⁣

own your life⁣

own your time⁣

own your contribution to humanity on a deep level⁣

be cool kind to other people⁣

don’t take yourself too seriously⁣

bonus bad stuff will happen move forward and don’t blame god for the bad stuff

you love your work when your work is with people you love

there is nothing from the past that makes me think things used to be better we live in the greatest of times be grateful

do you want to be remembered for the money you made or the life you live⁣

people say freedom comes with responsibility so why do responsible people keep limiting their freedom each choice you make makes you more free or less

there is a sanctification in sacrifice–that’s where the greek word comes from now whether you take that sanctification or holiness literally or figuratively there is a glow about people who serve and give and sacrifice for others ⁣

those that dwell create their own hell

have you noticed that the world shrinks when you travel

if you have a project to pour your learnings into you will retain the knowledge

nah you don’t want a break from your life bad goal make this your life if you have to escape you’re in prison

if you can create work that enhances your lifedo it but most people sadly lose their lives on their workunnecessarily

create a space for the person you want to become not the person you were

over all the experiences

vast sensation and desires

there are myriad ways to make money yet regardless of how much you’re paid how and why you get paid dictates your lifestyle

dreams become nightmares when dreams become jobs

i wake up knowing every day that i might die and then i do whatever i want

love holds the key to human happiness

happiness lives inside of the smallest moments

cherish life cherish and respect love these are the energy frequencies in our existence that have the most likelihood of changing this world and the universe as we know it

there are only  things about life that you can be sure about

of course that you will die someday

life never ceases to amaze you surprise you

so drop all your expectations embrace your mortality and live fully as you will die any moment when

you live this way you will be anchored no matter what is happening to you

it would be very beneficial to remain consciously aware during any experience because the mind will otherwise start to fill presence with thoughts and emotions

a smile offers a gateway to understanding and sharing it is a path that leads to love

this is a quote from my upcoming book that reflects on living and loving more consciously

happiness is in you

we are sharing the gift of life and love and compassion is our path therefore life and love can flow freely through this precious endowment

lest love not be forgotten and it is best experienced through thoughtless devotion

love is equivalent to life it cannot be defined interpreted manipulated or used to fulfill human based wants and needs

open your heart to the beauty of living and you will experience life and love within all things

love is the mainstream movement flowing through the expansion of life energy experiencing it is considered to be as easy as falling off a log however as with life and conscious awareness we must acknowledge love and take responsibility for it

you cannot settle and be happy

stay away from the people who are the cause of your lifes misery approach the people who are the cause of your lifes happiness

answers are within

your sanity of mind is yours

dont lease

so to cause your ultimate peace

permanence is an illusion nothing lasts when this awareness arrives in your life you awaken to happiness – to embracing what is to finding meaning and purpose in what is and to be content with what is

there is no greater joy than being an ingredient in the joy of others

i was sunk deep in my middle age all the same i laid my head against her breast ‘i have been happy’ i said ‘but i have seen so bored for so long

be focused on your happiness deciding what not to do because doing it doesn’t make you happy is as important as knowing what to do you often arrive at doing what you love doing by choosing not to do stuff that makes you unhappy

how can you be happy when you are sad

good question there

happiness and sadness are not opposite states

life is never about just being happy

fortune is longterm happiness nurtured with patience and knowledge

the world will progress with you or without you its always a choice either you part of something that really matters

a woman is never so drunk with happiness as when she discovers desire in the eyes of a man

its ok to be successful in your own way no matter what control freaks say

dont search for happiness outside it is inside you

to be in love with life is to be in touch with our spiritual essence it is to see beauty and loveliness wherever we go it is to see the glow of divinity in all those around us

but if they the infinitely dead were awakening an image within us

see they would perhaps point to the catkins

hanging from the bare hazels or

mean the rain pelting the dark earth in spring—

and we who think of happiness as

rising would feel an emotion

that almost startles

when a happy thing falls

the weight of the world

under the burden

under the burden

the weight

the weight we carry

who can deny

it touches

the body

looks out of the heart

burning with purity—

for the burden of life

but we carry the weight

and so must rest

in the arms of love

must rest in the arms

no rest

no sleep

be mad or chill

obsessed with angels

or machines

the final wish

—cannot be bitter

if denied

the weight is too heavy

for no return

as thought

in all the excellence

of its excess

the warm bodies

in the darkness

the hand moves

to the center

of the flesh

the skin trembles

and the soul comes

joyful to the eye—

that’s what

to return

to the body

where i was born

yes you will you have no end of pluck one day you are going to be very happy

never gerty we rich girls always end up with sneaks no decent person comes near us

what sort of things

gertrude paused a minute then said bravely our own selfrespect and the integrity of the people we care for

that sounds very nice replied conny without enthusiasm but i should like a little bit of the more obvious sort of happiness as well

gertrude gave a laugh which was also a sob

so should i conny so should i

unfortunately its not against the law in this country to drink yourself to death

i feel i have adequate cause to be happy and i will be happy goodbye

i would simply like to reclaim an old and alas quite unfashionable private formula moderate enjoyment is double enjoyment and do not overlook the little joys

you make do with what you have as you age you learn even to be happy with what you have that’s one of the few good points of growing older

if you have haters the solution is simple ignore them and keep doing what you do

if a hater can directly influence your plans then your plans aren’t ambitious enough

there is no magic wand to get rid of haters there is no secret spell to win them over to your side

progress on the social ladder is almost always the result of progress in other areas of your life

student how does selfrealization of an individual help society

know how you hide something important at a safe place so bad that you end up forgetting the place yourself i think i did that to my happiness

i dont know whether to be happy or sad when people say they relate with my words

im actually a very secure and happy person and i know this because i tell it to my therapist every monday for fifty minutes

awareness breeds health whereas callousness breeds more suffering

what is your heart worth

what about your time

what holds your heart holds your attention

what holds your attention holds your time

what holds your time holds your life

and if its possessions that holds these things

it will demand it all

if in doubt choose happiness

those who are happy belong more to themselves than they belong to the world

arrange your friendlist in a very prioritized order because sometimes people might be replaced buy your selfrespect and dignity cant

being a successful person your luck and your believe in yourself is not necessary the only thing which is quite needed is your hardwork

achieving a state of peaceful bliss is much sought after though the attainment of such should never be conflated with accessing higher truth

do things you can steadily improve at

help others if you’ve already helped yourself

reduce daily decisions to routine

hugs from heaven

fall from above

the world is our beauty

our friend for life

the angels will guide us

throughout this life

and her wings gave her poise in her heavenly flight so that all could behold her beauty

the rose was red

the color of love

its petals vibrant

a sign of your love

its stem did twine

around my heart

but it couldnt keep it pumping

one day it failed to start

as clouds parted

we only had our memories

to remember

our love would last

but time went on

your love did change

and so the rose

began to change

petals did fade

my rose was wilting

showing its age

red was no more

black was the hue

without your love

what was i to do

i tended my garden

the thoughts in my mind

for you were still my love

for me in my mind

we have at our fingertips access to so much meaning and promise if we would only let ourselves see

some people think very cleverly ‘let me

live my whole life the way i want to live

in the last few moments i will remember

god and chant his name and enter heaven

somehow’ please be very clear only that

which you thought of in your whole life

will come up when you leave the body

some people think very cleverly ‘let me

live my whole life the way i want to live

in the last few moments i will remember

god and chant his name and enter heaven

somehow’ please be very clear only that

which you thought of in your whole life

will come up when you leave the body

don’t think that at that last moment you

can play the game no

what is it called when you feel warm and content and wish things would stay that way

i guess youd call it happiness said harga

happiness is the manifestation of confronting only good

sometimes life does not give us everything that we want but then that is what life is all about you cant have happiness all the time and neither can you have sadness all the time but you can create a symphony out of happiness and sadness

maybe the ending isnt even really the point just as long as there was a happy somewhere along the way

psychology explains that thoughts arise in

the brain and emotions from the heart

irrespective of where they arise from

thoughts and emotions are inseparable

ancient scriptures say that thoughts create

us so do emotions we become what our

emotions are managing our emotions is

crucial to transforming our lives

hdh bhagavan sri nithyananda paramashivam in the book living enlightenment

life is strange life can give you everything even when you don’t desire for anything and life can take away your entire happiness when you need it the most

the secret to a happy life is having lots of interests interests are ammunition against despair

the heart that was filled

with your memories

is empty and lost now

i claim to enjoy the rain

while there’s a cyclone within

there’s always a smile on my face

but i question

is there any happiness

when the entire world is asleep

your silence speaks to me

the heart that was filled

with your memories

is empty and lost now

i claim to enjoy the rain

while there’s a storm within

there’s always a smile on my face

but i question

is there any happiness

love me until the flames of the last star burn out

a person who is happy is not thinking about the past

she played the keys of my heart gently yet sensually setting my soul on fire

you do not have to fight and struggle to build a better life

the secret is in being satisfied and happy with where you are and still working everyday for the betterment

there is no better way to feel happier than to be content with who you are

the accomplishments of one person show how much he invested in certain areas of his life and how much he neglected all the others

world domination means conquering the space around you finding happiness in your everyday because there is no real world just the one you create

the secret to a happy life is having lots of interests interests are ammunition against despair

a person who sees the good in things has good thoughts and he who has good thoughts receives pleasure from life

you never know what another person is going through and sometimes your smile might be something that makes a difference in their day

lifes too short to be bashful were all just human and far from perfect so why not enjoy it

i am whole and powerful i am loving and harmonious i am forgiving and happy i am at peace

i never want to waste time after all were just passing observers as insignificant to these giant formations as a speck of dust so we might as well appreciate the view and enjoy the journey

take life seriously that you have to do dont take yourself seriously thats the key let it all go dont care for a second what people think of you in fact go out of their way to keep them guessing

happiness and absurd are the sons of same earth

q when the master clears the

karmas do we have to go

through pain

when the master removes the karma you

call that feeling pain actually the master

would be removing in a second the

suffering of many births what would have

otherwise taken many births to dissolve

so it is practically no suffering in

sharada devi says the master clearing the

samskaras is like you facing a thorn prick

you can stop

as caed budris says happiness is the space between on desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming

you don’t go around saying am i happy all the time unless you’re human of course

dont be passive act have interests if you want to be happy dont just let life happen to you

it’s easy to assume that we should undertake a particular clutterclearing task when we’re very clear about why we’re doing it it’s easier to use our time and energy productively—and also to recognize success

then we’re all happy

that we are indeed answered the princess sobbing

farewell dearest and most beloved of menwhatever may be my fatebe happiness yours once more my lingering foreboding heart repeats farewell

smile as often as you can its free therapy

carpe diem means seize the day make the best of it in every way dont lose a moment come what may forget about tomorrow just live today

the one thing that is as real as happiness is

how temporary it is

we think we are this but in reality we are that not the body that we look like but the spirit in fact

we are all waiting for someone to come back from the past bringing a lost happiness

man is so busy creating cosmetics for the skin that he has not discovered what lies within

dont just be happy be humbled as well

if happier beings had a better chance of survival and the sad ones perished surely by now the emotion of sorrow would be extinct

and when no time was left we realized that we lost happiness in the pursuit of finding it

you are always the totality of anything no matter what you experience or confront

how would it be to not do anything in a given moment does this sound impossible this is easier than the mind thinks it is often about letting go and allowing instead of making something happen this nonreaction opens the portal to stillness

please focus on this simple realization there is only every now and how you interact with this moment decides everything that you are experiencing

communication and openness are essential in nurturing understanding fairness and respect

the key to embracing who you are is experienced now however it is never about focusing on the now instead it is about being the now

embracing who you are now will allow you to be who you will become your true essence will fully blossom spontaneously through this simple acknowledgement

you ‘think’ that you want or need to love and this is what stops you from truly loving

we as well as other objects in the universe are unified through the manifestation of life it is possible for us to consciously awaken and nurture this dimension of life energy consciousness

it’s just a drama we come and we go why fear why worry just enjoy the show

happiness should be a function without any parameters

well happiness doesn’t always need a reason a practical reason neither does sadness

like so many things around happiness honesty is simple if not always easy

you’re in a bad relationship when you spend most of the time pretending that you’re happy move on move out enough of this selfbetrayal

seize the day and make every moment your own

dont wait for the sunshine to brighten your day

it is the height of human happiness to have somebody to love our agony is that we have all the light and the paint but no canvas to put the art of our hearts on

let your shoes take you to where your happiness grows

do not hunt for dreams  happiness that society or humanity dictate and define wake up

fill yourself with love and peace and you will never be incomplete

i believe happiness itself is found in accepting even dwelling in what we fail to excel at

this is how you get through life duck

remember success brings money money doesnt bring success and the way to success is to do something were passionate about

but to succeed we must commit to it we must believe that it is the thing for us it is where our happiness and fortune lies

our purpose in life leads us to happiness and a sense of calm

there is no happiness without honesty if youre seeking happiness start by being totally honest

the only way to bring peace and happiness is from within

when you are at peace with yourself all desirable things will come to you

there can of course be many different kinds of division in a country language religion race class etc however of all these race seems to be the most difficult to bridge

crowd sourcing your self esteem on social media is a sign of weakness and emotional illiteracy

happiness is an attitude of self confidence

a success and happiness principle that all animals except humans know  you can achieve wonders by loving what you do

the ultimate secret to live a full life is to keep adding small happy moments and to believe that happiness is in now

at least now i knew that my heart was wedded to the mountainsto the wild places it was there and there alone that i was whole contented and blissful no relationship career or wealth could ever take its place

i realized what i felt    happy it was such a strange unusual feeling—light calm as though i’d swallowed sunshine

the one that looks beyond the mind knows there is only one truth to find there among the highs and lows in and outs and ups and downs remains a stillness every unbound

remember that the sun always shines even after stormy days

emotions can be a byproduct of chronic exposure to the contagious creation energy with which you most often surround yourself

obstacles are a sign youre doing something you care about and that matters to you

a smile just like a moment of living consciously can ripple out touching and changing everything in the universe

what is life perception how we perceive it corresponds with how we feel in any given moment perception and awareness go handinhand true awareness is a state of presence or oneness

she would be quite bright if she was ever put in a position to find out but long ago found that being a scatterbrain as shed put it give you an easier journey through life

i wish i didn’t feel so strong about you like happiness and love revolve around you

healthy emotions are like a systematic investment plan invest in them to gain happiness

you do not come and then must go you are constant eternally so…do not look out there to find what you already know

happiness was bubbling up through me a bright stream laughing

the key to discovering presence depends on your ability to observe yourself and releasing all demands placed on the moment at hand

in as much as being the one to receive is a nice and pleasing gesture however the truth is i feel much much happier when i give than received because it brings me satisfaction it brings peace to my heart and it brings relief to my soul

happiness is not pleasure  it is victory

finding meaning in life is a key component to a long and healthy life

if life is a cup of tea gratitude is the honey that makes it sweet

happiness isnt possible without freedom

when the glow in the mountains lights your soul

when you find yourself looking at the splendour of the clouds or a bird in flight

pause and drop a pin

when the movement of wind on the water lulls you into a timeless peace

when the setting sun holds you in its golden light

pause and drop a pin

when life shrinks you down

when you lose your way and cold winds make you pull your jacket tightly over your chest

when you feel darkness enter your mind and hope seems out of reach

remember all the sacred places that invited you into yourself

remember the vast expanse of all those pins

a little piece of you lives in those corners

dont let your heart shrink or your world grow small

relax into your expansive and most radiant heart

we dont end at our own skin we will always exist everywhere we have dropped a pin

its better to be realistic and come out of the virtual world social media pushups the moment you do this you will come to acknowledge the worthly connections of your life

your happiness is my concern and you may be certain that in it i shall find my own

it’s a privilege to feel and misery my friend is necessary otherwise happiness would lose its charm

i remind myself if happiness is fleeting then so is sadness

i remind myself depression is the weather and im a weatherworn tree

i remind myself even the worst storms pass

i remind myself ive survived them all

nobody owes you anything so when you get something be appreciative

ninety percent of the people are not happy with their jobs the remaining ten percent don’t deserve their jobs in the first place

joy is like air we take it for granted until its not there then we know desperately how much it is needed

just like happiness is a conscious choice sufferings is also an unconscious choice our intention is to eliminate that unconscious choice from the society

with droplets of music

be you—your authentic imperfect self

women feel the most secure when they see true love for themselves in their partner’s eyes and for them security equals happiness

you are in control of how you set the tone of your day

i feel what i need to feel happiness anxiety joy sadness i let the waves ride themselves out without being consumed by madness

ill tell you a secret about being happy sometimes you just have to pretend at it until it become real

its critical that you are aware of your thought patterns throughout the day thats a determining factor of your success

if you are waking up believing that there is more to life than there is — then there is more for you out there

choose being kind over being right and youll never be wrong

if you cant let your past die it wont let you live

we must know what ‘actually’ makes us happy rather than what ‘should’ make us happy the only way to know the truth is to experiment with what is supposed to bring us happiness and then see the results on ourselves

at the restaurant

what would you like to order sir

entrepreneurship is a lonely road to greatness

while you seek it they will ask

but once youve found it

they will know

for one thing is true

when youre happy it shows

life isn’t won and lost on the first day

if you feel the change in beauty

you can feel the beat of happiness

excuses are barriers between dreams and actions

do you really want to hold onto empty things we don’t have to give anything up they just need transforming a thousand years of happiness would be much better than another thousand years of tears don’t you think

welcome the new dawn

and help it to be a brighter day

the only thing you’re entitled to in life is nothing

after the struggle there’s greatness on the other side

the deepest valleys are closer than you think to the nearest mountaintops

everyone has a shot at greatness

forgiveness the ability to forgive oneself stop here for a few breaths and think about this because it is the key to making art and very possibly the key to finding any semblance of happiness in life

yesterday was the last day you said ‘i can’t’ today is the first day you say ‘i will

after lunch  one short nap

on waking up  two cups of tea

raising my head i see the suns light

once again slanting to the southwest

those who are happy regret the shortness of the day

those who are sad tire of the years sloth

but those whose hearts are devoid of joy or sadness

just go on living regardless of short or long

after lunch

childhood is not the happiest time of ones life but only to a child is pure happiness possible

happiness whats that i dont know how can one be happy when one loves a demon

gratitude is the antidote to entitlement

ludens felt again that special curious anguish caused by glimpses of a happiness he would have felt if only things were different — which could be different perhaps could easily be different — but somehow maddeningly were not

the fullness of happiness cant be define by money but can be felt when you are set free because truth will set us free if you truly want to be happy be set free

whatever is yet to come i shall never be able to say that i have not felt the greatest the purest joy life can hold

nobody believes you when you talk about happiness

she tasted for the first time honeysweet and dangerous happiness dangerous because as she before long began to learn precarious

sad faces are reflected in clouds of despair but happy faces are what bathes our emotions in happiness

one must never despair upon losing something whether it’s an individual or an experience of joy or happiness everything returns even more magnificently letters on life

their eyelashes were moist and small drops of sweat beaded their upper lips i regarded their slumber almost innocent in its foolish thoughtlessness and its oblivion of all danger and the outside world is this what human beings call happiness

minute wisdom of conscious goal setters i want my goal where i end up to be perfect in the scenario of synchronicity whatever that is

the socalled complexities we encounter in daily activities are nothing more than misinterpretations of the now

raindrops smile when it rains because they know that if they didnt then you would feel unhappy

god invented music so poor people could be happy

don’t demand respect earn it don’t expect loyalty build it

the opiumeater cannot present himself in the character of lallegro even then he speaks and thinks as becomes il penseroso

i believe in the sun

even when it is not shining

and i believe in love

even when there’s no one there

and i believe in god

even when he is silent

i believe through any trial

there is always a way

but sometimes in this suffering

and hopeless despair

my heart cries for shelter

to know someone’s there

but a voice rises within me saying hold on

my child i’ll give you strength

i’ll give you hope just stay a little while

i believe in the sun

even when it is not shining

and i believe in love

even when there’s no one there

but i believe in god

even when he is silent

i believe through any trial

there is always a way

may there someday be sunshine

may there someday be happiness

may there someday be love
