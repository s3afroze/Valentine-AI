skirmishes against the author

raging along the borders of every page

kierkegaard or conor cruise obrien

they seem to say

i would bolt the door and beat some logic into your head

other comments are more offhand dismissive

that kind of thing

i remember once looking up from my reading

my thumb as a bookmark

trying to imagine what the person must look like

who wrote dont be a ninny

alongside a paragraph in the life of emily dickinson

students are more modest

needing to leave only their splayed footprints

along the shore of the page

one scrawls metaphor next to a stanza of eliots

another notes the presence of irony

fifty times outside the paragraphs of a modest proposal

or they are fans who cheer from the empty bleachers

hands cupped around their mouths

absolutely they shout

to duns scotus and james baldwin

yes bullseye my man

check marks asterisks and exclamation points

rain down along the sidelines

and if you have managed to graduate from college

in a margin perhaps now

is the time to take one step forward

we have all seized the white perimeter as our own

and reached for a pen if only to show

we did not just laze in an armchair turning pages

we pressed a thought into the wayside

planted an impression along the verge

even irish monks in their cold scriptoria

jotted along the borders of the gospels

brief asides about the pains of copying

a bird singing near their window

or the sunlight that illuminated their page

anonymous men catching a ride into the future

on a vessel more lasting than themselves

and you have not read joshua reynolds

they say until you have read him

enwreathed with blakes furious scribbling

yet the one i think of most often

the one that dangles from me like a locket

was written in the copy of catcher in the rye

i borrowed from the local library

i was just beginning high school then

reading books on a davenport in my parents living room

who after birth didst by my side remain

till snatcht from thence by friends less wise than true

who thee abroad exposed to public view

made thee in rags halting to th press to trudge

where errors were not lessened all may judge

at thy return my blushing was not small

my rambling brat in print should mother call

i cast thee by as one unfit for light

the visage was so irksome in my sight

yet being mine own at length affection would

thy blemishes amend if so i could

i washed thy face but more defects i saw

and rubbing off a spot still made a flaw

i stretcht thy joints to make thee even feet

yet still thou runst more hobbling than is meet

in better dress to trim thee was my mind

but nought save homespun cloth i th house i find

in this array mongst vulgars mayst thou roam

in critics hands beware thou dost not come

and take thy way where yet thou art not known

if for thy father askt say thou hadst none

and for thy mother she alas is poor

which caused her thus to send thee out of door

across the tundra miles from home

girl in red how swift she speeds

climbing mountains for the lead

snowy lakes and frozen streams

pelting paws thunder their sound

knik to willow the race is on

across the tundra miles from home

as day meets night

hear the music floating by

girl in red soars to the sky

bodies legs and lightest paws

across the line to great applause

knik to willow now darkness falls

see the mushers fight for all

persistence courage strength and care

mushers see it through and dare

running fast but running late

the world it watches still awake

the brightest lantern is their guide

stars gaze down – no longer hide

knik to willow the race was on

and now the sled dogs all are home

meat is plenty for them all

winners losers victors all

when northern lights dance in the snow

girl in red just hear them go

howls pierce the air like darts

so fast they run their beating hearts

she loves that writers make words their servants and bend them to their will

the pursuit of knowing was freedom to me the right to declare your own curiosities and follow them through all manner of books

judy blume some books you never forget some characters become your friends for life

my taste for life is different and

it’s always been that way

books are cold declared arthur merwyn they allow no questions offer no explanations they talk to us behind a screen their tone is lifeless and monotonous they charm not our attention by mute significances of gesture and look

loneliness seeks out metaphors not just for definition but for the companionship of resonance the promise of kinship in comparison

i like to read people rather than books

i only read books with words on the pages im picky like that

ivy its just a book

no such thing as just a book

… becoming a reader is a change for the better trust me no one has ever lost by becoming addicted to stories – to the lessons learned by those who possess enough courage to put pen to paper

the best aspect of my invisible friend was the help they gave me in writing books

in the absence of real society i made my own out of the imagined people peter flynt slid into my locker they entered like corpses on a slab but they came to life in my mind with each turn of the page

books were made for healing and learning and growing and completely removing yourself from real life and plopping down into a fantasy world

how do you tell a dream from a nightmare if it involves a book burning  its probably a nightmare

theres only one way to run away from your own story and thats to sneak into someone elses i unwedged the leatherbound book from beneath my mattress and breathed in the inkandadventure smell of it i walked through it into another world

the fact that you’ll never know what sort of person you might have been if you’d read different stuff

nathaniel´s expression grew odd you like this place

of course i do it has books in it

i felt like a woman reading a mystery novel with every fourth line missing theres really only one thing a person can do when theyre hipdeep in a mystery novel keep reading

i never saw my mother again but i carried her with me always

the very best authors are no longer with us so only read books written by dead people

reading remains one of the purest things i do

what if people dont like it what if they dont even take the chance to read it but they hate us for whats inside of it

all books have magical properties

lost in a quatrain  the state of being deep in thought contemplative

they were alive and they spoke to me that is the simplest and most eloquent way in which i can refer to those authors who have remained with me over the years

books tend to react with one another creating randomized magic with a mind of its own

when it comes to books timing is everything the time to read each book is the moment you get it

to find out what a story’s really about’ the librarian said ‘you don’t ask the writer you ask the reader

we ought to recollect  that a book consists like man from whom it draws its lineage of a body and a soul

i think one should never be too busy to teach those who are anxious to learn

life is like an endless book each day is a new page and only death can bring the end to this little book of yours

when i was a girl i loved reading an archaic pastime i know the index and download are faster more efficient offering superior retention and acquisition of knowledge

authors we write to pretend were not crazy for talking to ourselves

goodhue wanted visitors to feel more than they were in a pretty building he wanted them to feel they were part of a threedimensional meditation on the power of human intellect and the potency of storytelling

picture books build readers mr leon two missing books from our collection is like two missing bricks from a cathedral

thats what books do maddie used to say they are a conversation and introduce us to ourselves and others

people were noisome demanding judgmental books gave everything and asked nothing more than to be taken care of

its good to be reminded that the world is full of stories that are potentially at least as painful as yours

selfhelp books help you to become a better version of your present self

these books are my good friends

books were my broomstick they allowed me to fly to other realms where anything was possible

but you say it intreeging lj not intrigyouing’ i said it back to her ‘intreeging’ okay this is a problem with books but the only one

people are always asking that about books whats it about it sounds like a simple question but it isnt you could take all day to answer it if you really wanted to and if the person asking the question really wanted to hear

there are no second chances at life

women with clean houses do not have finished books

a type i would never have met only read about in books for books were where you found life without the effort of being in the real world

books can not teach you how to live life it comes from experience

look at all the books in this place every one of them is inside you and youre inside them

sweetheart its a public library not my private library it needs people

they got out of the habit is all

the world has changed

no everybody needs a story miss perkins thats something that never ever changes

a writer can create a more just world in books by shining a light on that injustice

heavenly interference may come our plans have been spotted the prayers that corporate are confiscating are too many too forceful tooauthoritative that means there are jesus followers in the area

digressions incontestably are the sunshine they are the life the soul of reading  take them out of this book for instance  you might as well take the book along with them

id recently finished reading a management tome which seemed to be aimed at psychopaths with no common sense quite a dangerous combination

a christmas without a book for a present is a disappointment

these books are my good friends

he flipped on a light and we were in his front room which was warm and smelt of woodsmoke books lamps pot plants books books everywhere

he snapped the notebook shut i know all of this must be very frightening for you but try not to agitate yourself excitement will only worsen the inflammation

she stared thewhat

greatness belongs to those who dare to reach for it

i think fiction at its best can serve as a moment of induced bafflement that calls into question our usual relation to things and reminds us that our minds as nice as they are aren’t necessarily up to the task of living and shouldn’t get cocky

every voracious reader knows that there is no dewey system for the babel of the mind you walk amid the labyrinthine stacks and ideas leap at you like dust bunnies drawn from the motes that cover a great many different books ready long ago

i really wish kitty were more of a reader like margot and me

great writing is about packing a single thought into a handful of words so that your life can be enlarged by a boatload of growth and if what you’re reading isn’t doing that for you it’s just scribbling

to plan a book — or an escape — the first thing to know is what to exclude

words can be preserved experience cannot and thats why humanity clings to its words

am i penny i say from sand on our beach and austin and sheila… am i them are they me

i’ve never loved any of my characters that much he says but i love you that much so maybe … so that’s where i went that’s what i went with

from a child i was fond of reading and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books

god save me from the yearners the insatiable the inconsolable the ones who chafe and claw against the edges of the world no book can save them

i sit tired of reading i am sick of books i cant tell where i leave off and the books begin im nobody im a polluted nothing a confessed sin an open door the clutterer in the clutter

but it is also

to the stars

to metaphor and meaning

and to humanity

a town…asked him to donate a church bell he told them to forsake the steeple and build a library for which he sent books instead of a bell sense being preferable to sound

to take a thought to gingerly package it in a handful of words and then to deliver it to a person for whom both the thought and the words within which it came are lifesaving is writing at its best anything else is scribbling at its worst

she quite happily replied that she had plenty of books to keep her company

the director sighed her attachment to grimoires is

concerning yes indeed if she does not suffer from the lack of company i fear it is because she sees grimoires as her friends in place of people

books are treasure of stories that want to be heard in silence by an individual who understands

in a fractured and fractious world reading is an act of defiance that proclaims that understanding and tolerance are values worth fighting for

readultery  the act of being unfaithful to one book by reading another concurrently

no you cant leave a library without a book

customer this book has a couple of tears to some of the pages

me yes unfortunately some of the older books haven’t had as much love as they should have done from previous owners

customer so will you lower the price it says here it’s £

me i’m sorry but we take into account the condition of the books when we price them if that book was in a better condition it would be worth a lot more than £

customer well you can’t have taken this tear here into account points to page or this one here points to another page because my son did those two minutes ago

me so the book is now more damaged than it was before because of your son

customer yes exactly so will you lower the price

customer is your poetry section split up into rhyming and nonrhyming sections

bookseller no it’s just in alphabetical order what kind of poetry are you looking for

customer rhyming preferably iambic pentameter in poems of no more than ten lines by a female poet but other than that i don’t mind

with everything i know i could create a book and with everything i know not i could create a library

every time someone speaks a faith statement it gives heaven

more energy one ingredient to answered prayers is faith heaven runs on that power

your love for something is what comes from above touches your heart and soothes your soul

he who is taught becomes skilled

don’t be evil kindness is good

make your memorial last through love of you

increase the people befriend the town

want to fix it all save the world change the system ensure progress get books into the hands of kids and your work will be done

asking a decent editor to save this book would have been like asking a doctor to help a corpse that had fallen from the top of the empire state building

set your heart on books

i watched those seized for labor

there’s nothing better than books

its not over when the curtains come down its over when you choose not to perform anymore

copy your fathers your ancestors

see their words endure in books

open read them copy their knowledge

he who is taught becomes skilled

don’t be evil kindness is good

all the wrong things in life will make sense at the write time

a wrong man will never think he is doing wrong even if the right man warns him

whoever who prepares and wishes to win a war must make books his first and closest ally

bookseller weve got a copy of david copperfield from  for

scream as loud as you want

books are letters in bottles cast into the waves of time from one person trying to save the world to another

being surrounded by books was the closest shed ever gotten to feeling like the member of a gang the books had her back and the nonfiction at least was ready to fight if necessary

after family books are the things that make me happy books are my solace my sanctuary from the everyday cares if i could i would make reading my soul occupation

books the estate agent had told him provide excellent insulation and since the heating bills would be very considerable in any event he might as well leave them there even if he had no intention of ever reading them

we are not the stories that others hear about is we are the stories that we know about ourselves

a particularly good book had a way of opening new spaces in ones mind it even invited you to come back later and rummage through what youd learned

within the pages of books ive journeyed to mandalay the milky way and santa fe

helen read a great deal the feel of a book in her hands was an ancient solace  not originally because of what lay between the covers but as a screen a defence a shield

a good book is always resistant to the destructive effects of time

if you are happily married for what you have highly devoured from your beloved wifeis however legalthe world clasps respectfully

without any means to disapprovethough jealous and you too had given your wife an heavenly drinkmany a time with her minds consent in order to fill what eternal sexual divinity is all about

there were about three other homes after that but i was barely present i

had learned to hide well i don’t mean to sound breezy about all this but i

actually don’t recall much outside the deep aloneness i felt when i was apart

from my books

but this is a library she replied in surprise what do they expectthat the books wont try to bite off their fingers

i did however vow to stop reading books that i didn’t enjoy i used to pride myself on finishing every book i started—no longer

we humans have many ways to complain what burning sunlight gives more than a days light until purple moon cures us with her fondling balmslike every pain has a remedy to heal and future to grow

there were no bookshelves in the little apartment where we lived so the professor’s study with its stacks of volumes lining the walls seemed magical to him

reading literacy and learning are fundamentally important to establishing strong and stable democracies visit your local public library and expand your mind

even though it may be fiction i never want to lie about the world i know the black one

i wish to write truth even in a fictionalized world derived from my imagination it should tell an accurate narrative of who we are and who we have the potential to be

i knew you talked to books i didnt realize they listened

how fitting that the most terrifying time in my life should require me to do what i do best escape into a book

don’t you ever reread a book you liked once the words were out of her mouth she regretted them there were plenty of people who didn’t read for pleasure let alone reread

but tom smiled and shook his head i used to when i was a tyke but how can you read a book you’ve already read when you know there are all those other ones out there

an excellent argument mr mclaury i can only defend my position by saying that i use my old books as seasoning for the new ones—i sprinkle them lightly through my reading

i knew you talked to books i didnt realize they listened

an author’s great day is releasing your book into the world like a butterfly and having a reviewer come upon it and say…oh that’s lovely

an infinite supply of paper to be sure but nothing more than paper strewn with marks like debris from an explosion

give all your time and attention to books and see the magic

and who are you really tallis are you going to be the hero of selkirk rather than its monster a promise of hope rather than a warning of darker things to come

do you usually dine alone i asked

quoting a letter by charles f lummis books are the last things that any human being can afford to do without

books are a sort of cultural dna the code for who as a society we are and what we know

if it gleamsthe wakeful spirit which the purest

in mine own fill of ecstasy daring to swell tho be the waning nightwhose fadingblast find anew a song the very latest from my quill
