the most wasted of all days is one without laughter

more smiling less worrying more compassion less judgment more blessed less stressed more love less hate

trees are sanctuaries whoever knows how to speak to them whoever knows how to listen to them can learn the truth they do not preach learning and precepts they preach undeterred by particulars the ancient law of life

knock and hell open the door

vanish and hell make you shine like the sun

fall and hell raise you to the heavens

become nothing and hell turn you into everything

make your own bible select and collect all the words and sentences that in all your readings have been to you like the blast of a trumpet

be impeccable with your word

speak with integrity say only what you mean avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love

dont take anything personally

nothing others do is because of you what others say and do is a projection of their own reality their own dream when you are immune to the opinions and actions of others you wont be the victim of needless suffering

dont make assumptions

find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings sadness and drama with just this one agreement you can completely transform your life

always do your best

your best is going to change from moment to moment it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick under any circumstance simply do your best and you will avoid selfjudgment selfabuse and regret

science is not only compatible with spirituality it is a profound source of spirituality

believe in your infinite potential your only limitations are those you set upon yourself

no woman wants to be in submission to a man who isnt in submission to god

you can safely assume youve created god in your own image when it turns out that god hates all the same people you do

the possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery there is always more mystery

lord make me an instrument of thy peace

where there is hatred let me sow love

where there is injury pardon

where there is doubt faith

where there is despair hope

where there is darkness light

and where there is sadness joy

o divine master grant that i may not so much seek

to be consoled as to console

to be understood as to understand

to be loved as to love

for it is in giving that we receive

it is in pardoning that we are pardoned

and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life

a single day is enough to make us a little larger or another time a little smaller

dare to love yourself

as if you were a rainbow

with gold at both ends

it does not matter how long you are spending on the earth how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received it is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters

we are not human beings having a spiritual experience we are spiritual beings having a human experience

we are all connected to each other biologically to the earth chemically to the rest of the universe atomically

how hurtful it can be to deny ones true self and live a life of lies just to appease others

what you are is gods gift to you what you become is your gift to god

the only time you fail is when you fall down and stay down

my religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind

im not afraid of death because i dont believe in it

its just getting out of one car and into another

the moment god is figured out with nice neat lines and definitions we are no longer dealing with god

a sacrifice to be real must cost must hurt and must empty ourselves give yourself fully to god he will use you to accomplish great things on the condition that you believe much more in his love than in your weakness

i never liked jazz music because jazz music doesnt resolve but i was outside the bagdad theater in portland one night when i saw a man playing the saxophone i stood there for fifteen minutes and he never opened his eyes

after that i liked jazz music

sometimes you have to watch somebody love something before you can love it yourself it is as if they are showing you the way

i used to not like god because god didnt resolve but that was before any of this happened

i have lived with several zen masters  all of them cats

your sacred space is where you can find yourself over and over again

rejection is an opportunity for your selection

my heart is so small

its almost invisible

how can you place

such big sorrows in it

look he answered

your eyes are even smaller

yet they behold the world

reexamine all you have been told dismiss what insults your soul

the words ‘i love you’ kill and resurrect millions in less than a second

if you obsess over whether you are making the right decision you are basically assuming that the universe will reward you for one thing and punish you for another

the universe has no fixed agenda once you make any decision it works around that decision there is no right or wrong only a series of possibilities that shift with each thought feeling and action that you experience

when you connect to the silence within you that is when you can make sense of the disturbance going on around you

i dont profess any religion i dont think it’s possible that there is a god i have the greatest difficulty in understanding what is meant by the words ‘spiritual’ or ‘spirituality

interview the new yorker dec

what has he found who has lost god

and what has he lost who has found god

are you looking for me

i am in the next seat

my shoulder is against yours

you will not find me in the stupas

not in indian shrine rooms

nor in synagogues

nor in cathedrals

not in masses

nor kirtans

not in legs winding around your own neck

nor in eating nothing but vegetables

when you really look for me

you will see me instantly —

you will find me in the tiniest house of time

kabir says student tell me what is god

he is the breath inside the breath

we have a choice we have two options as human beings we have a choice between conversation and war thats it conversation and violence and faith is a conversation stopper

do not abandon yourselves to despair we are the easter people and hallelujah is our song

a bridge of silver wings stretches from the dead ashes of an unforgiving nightmare

to the jeweled vision of a life started anew

criticism of others is thus an oblique form of selfcommendation we think we make the picture hang straight on our wall by telling our neighbors that all his pictures are crooked

love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved it finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being his inner self whether or not he is actually present whether or not he is still alive at all ceases somehow to be of importance

i once listened to an indian on television say that god was in the wind and the water and i wondered at how beautiful that was because it meant you could swim in him or have him brush your face in a breeze

you are one thing only you are a divine being an allpowerful creator you are a deity in jeans and a tshirt and within you dwells the infinite wisdom of the ages and the sacred creative force of all that is will be and ever was

if you dont behave as you believe you will end by believing as you behave

crying is one of the highest devotional songs one who knows crying knows spiritual practice if you can cry with a pure heart nothing else compares to such a prayer crying includes all the principles of yoga

religion is for people whore afraid of going to hell spirituality is for those whove already been there

you were born a child of light’s wonderful secret— you return to the beauty you have always been

selftalk reflects your innermost feelings

the power of human thought grows exponentially with the number of minds that share that thought

if a man is to live he must be all alive body soul mind heart spirit

the reality of loving god is loving him like hes a superhero who actually saved you from stuff rather than a santa claus who merely gave you some stuff

each star is a mirror reflecting the truth inside you

i distrust those people who know so well what god wants them to do because i notice it always coincides with their own desires

you are never alone you are eternally connected with everyone

believe in your infinite potential your only limitations are those you set upon yourself

believe in yourself your abilities and your own potential never let selfdoubt hold you captive you are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for

reflection is the lamp of the heart if it departs the heart will have no light

these things will destroy the human race politics without principle progress without compassion wealth without work learning without silence religion without fearlessness and worship without awareness

reality is a projection of your thoughts or the things you habitually think about

an awake heart is like a sky that pours light

why i wake early

hello sun in my face

hello you who made the morning

and spread it over the fields

and into the faces of the tulips

and the nodding morning glories

and into the windows of even the

miserable and the crotchety –

best preacher that ever was

dear star that just happens

to be where you are in the universe

to keep us from everdarkness

to ease us with warm touching

to hold us in the great hands of light –

watch now how i start the day

our way of thinking creates good or bad outcomes

the spiritual life does not remove us from the world but leads us deeper into it

when a woman rises up in glory her energy is magnetic and her sense of possibility contagious

try to find pleasure in the speed that youre not used to changing the way you do routine things allows a new person to grow inside of you but when all is said and done youre the one who must decide how you handle it

beautify your inner dialogue beautify your inner world with love light and compassion life will be beautiful

the spiritualization of sensuality is called love it is a great triumph over christianity

when everything gets answered its fake

your greatest awakening comes when you are aware about your infinite nature

when your back is to the wall and you are facing fear head on the only way is forward and through it

leave the door open for the unknown the door into the dark that’s where the most important things come from where you yourself came from and where you will go

soul connections are not often found and are worth every bit of fight left in you to keep

there were silences in my head i could abandon myself completely to the pleasure of multiple relationships to the beauty of the day to the joys of the day it was as if a cancer in me had ceased gnawing me the cancer of introspection

pity the nation that is full of beliefs and empty of religion

pity the nation that wears a cloth it does not weave

and eats a bread it does not harvest

pity the nation that acclaims the bully as hero

and that deems the glittering conqueror bountiful

pity a nation that despises a passion in its dream

yet submits in its awakening

pity the nation that raises not its voice

save when it walks in a funeral

boasts not except among its ruins

and will rebel not save when its neck is laid

between the sword and the block

pity the nation whose statesman is a fox

whose philosopher is a juggler

and whose art is the art of patching and mimicking

pity the nation that welcomes its new ruler with trumpeting

and farewells him with hooting

only to welcome another with trumpeting again

pity the nation whose sages are dumb with years

and whose strongmen are yet in the cradle

pity the nation divided into fragments

each fragment deeming itself a nation

judgment is a negative frequency

there is almost a sensual longing for communion with others who have a large vision the immense fulfillment of the friendship between those engaged in furthering the evolution of consciousness has a quality impossible to describe

live simply deepest joy is like a flowerbeautiful in essence

love is not an emotion it is your very existence

ptsd is a wholebody tragedy an integral human event of enormous proportions with massive repercussions

most people are slow to champion love because they fear the transformation it brings into their lives and make no mistake about it love does take over and transform the schemes and operations of our egos in a very mighty way

unwinged and naked sorrow surrenders its crown to a throne called grace

the way is not in the sky the way is in the heart

success will be within your reach only when you start reaching out for it

before you can successfully make friends with others first you have to become your own friend

until you have suffered much in your heart you cannot learn humility

your life is your spiritual path

its whats right in front of you you cant live anyone elses life the task is to live yours and stop trying to copy one you think looks better

it sometimes takes a state of solitude to bring to mind the real power of companionship

and the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom

god is whispering in your heart in the whole existence just tune your ears

your thoughts are your message to the world just as the rays are the messages of the sun

nothing in all creation is so like god as stillness

the heart is like a woman and the head is like a man and although man is the head of woman woman is the heart of man and she turns mans head because she turns his heart

let nothing disturb you

let nothing frighten you

all things are passing away

patience obtains all things

whoever has god lacks nothing

you have been to hell ketut

he smiled of course hes been there

whats it like in hell

same like in heaven he said

he saw my confusion and tried to explain universe is a circle liss

he said to up to down  all same at end

i remembered an old christian mystic notion as above so below

i asked then how can you tell the difference between heaven and hell

because of how you go heaven you go up through seven happy places hell you go down through seven sad places this is why it better for you to go up liss he laughed

samesame he said same in end so better to be happy in journey

i said so if heaven is love then hell is

love too he said

ketut laughed again always so difficult for young people to understand this

i won’t have it the world is wilder than that in all directions more dangerous and bitter more extravagant and bright we are making hay when we should be making whoopee we are raising tomatoes when we should be raising cain or lazarus

the holy land is everywhere

the soul is like an uninhabited world

that comes to life only when

god lays his head

against us

and if he had judged her harshly if her life were a simple rosary of hours her life simple and strange as a birds life gay in the morning restless all day tired at sundown her heart simple and willful as a birds heart

too many people get credit for being good when they are only being passive they are too often praised for being broadminded when they are so broadminded they can never make up their minds about anything

the sea is only the embodiment of a

supernatural and wonderful existence

it is nothing but love and emotion

it is the ‘living infinite

when you catch yourself slipping into a pool of negativity notice how it derives from nothing other than resistance to the current situation

the more you believed in yourself the more you could trust yourself the more you trust yourself the less you compare yourself to others

feel nothing know nothing do nothing have nothing give up all to god and say utterly thy will be done we only dream this bondage wake up and let it go

if you know that i am an unbeliever then you know me better than i do myself i may be an unbeliever but i am an unbeliever who has a nostalgia for a belief

there is strange comfort in knowing that no matter what happens today the sun will rise again tomorrow

he who thinks halfheartedly will not believe in god but he who really thinks has to believe in god

each person you meet

is an aspect of yourself

when you fail that is when you get closer to success

it is not what to do but how much love we put into the doing we can do not greats only small things with great love  mother theresa

the struggles we endure today will be the ‘good old days’ we laugh about tomorrow

spirituality does not lie in meditating the body of an exmaster spirituality exists in mediating on your own inner body

be afraid of nothing hating none giving love to all feeling the love of god seeing his presence in everyone and having but one desire  for his constant presence in the temple of your consciousness  that is the way to live in this world

we all have bad days but one thing is true no cloud is so dark that the sun cant shine through

searching outside of you is samsara the world searching within you leads to nirvana

anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of spiritual realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and happiness is certainly a person eligible for liberation

faith does not need to push the river because faith is able to trust that there is a river the river is flowing we are in it

there are things you can’t reach but

you can reach out to them and all day long

the wind the bird flying away the idea of god

and it can keep you busy as anything else and happier

i look morning to night i am never done with looking

looking i mean not just standing around but standing around

as though with your arms open

it takes darkness to be aware of the light

you become mature when you become the authority of your own life

god loved us before he made us and his love has never diminished and never shall

we sinned for no reason but an incomprehensible lack of love and he saved us for no reason but an incomprehensible excess of love

even when muddy your wings sparkle bright wonders that heal broken worlds

at that moment of realization that union with god is always present thats when god let me go let me slide through his fingers with this last compassionate unspoken message

you may return here once you have fully come to understand that you are always here

she remembered who she was

and the game changed

when a woman conceives her true self a miracle occurs and life around her begins again

we could all do with a bit more joy in our lives couldnt we the wonderful thing is that when we start spreading joy we begin to actually experience more joy in our lives too

whole life is a search for beauty but when the beauty is found inside the search ends and a beautiful journey begins

sometimes i think there are only two instructions we need to follow to develop and deepen our spiritual life slow down and let go

if you think you can then you can

protect and bless all things

that have breath guard them

from all evil and let them sleep in peace

courage is the hallmark of spirituality courage comes when you love yourself for who you are

not till your thoughts cease all their branching here and there not till you abandon all thoughts of seeking for something not till your mind is motionless as wood or stone will you be on the right road to the gate

we would do ourselves a tremendous favor by letting go of the people who poison our spirit

we were talking of dragons tolkien and i

in a berkshire bar the big workman

who had sat silent and sucked his pipe

all the evening from his empty mug

with gleaming eye glanced towards us

i seen em myself he said fiercely

love spiritually not strategically

spirituality exist in testing and experiencing the depth of inner peace consistently

within each of us is a light awake encoded in the fibers of our existence divine ecstasy is the totality of this marvelous creation experienced in the hearts of humanity

shine your soul with the same

egoless humility as the rainbow

and no matter where you go

in this world or the next

love will find you attend you and bless you

do you have any advice for your readers

lead the life that’s yours instead of faking someone else’s

this is the secret of life the self lives only by dying finds its identity and its happiness only by selfforgetfulness selfgiving selfsacrifice and agape love

my biggest fear even now is that i will hear jesus words and walk away content to settle for less than radical obedience to him

except for the point the still point there would be no dance and there is only the dance

once you have surrendered yourself you make yourself receptive in receiving from god you are perfected and completed

like those in the valley behind us most people stand in sight of the spiritual mountains all their lives and never enter them being content to listen to others who have been there and thus avoid the hardships

religion is for those who dont want to go to hell and spirituality is for those who have already been there

what we do in every other area of our lives other than religion is rather than respect somebodys beliefs we evaluate their reasons

a healers power stems not from any special ability but from maintaining the courage and awareness to embody and express the universal healing power that every human being naturally possesses

god is the most beautiful and beauty is the expression of god if you cant appreciate beauty in the world how can you understand god

a flock of sparrows reels through the air looking more like a flying net than seventy conscious birds a black veil thrown on the wind when one sparrow dodges the whole net swerves dips one mind am i part of anything like that

all contemplative acts silences poems honor the world this way brought together by the eye of love a milkweed pod a twig allow us to see how things have been all along a feast of being

living in a world such as this is like dancing on a live volcano

the greatest untold story is the evolution of god

lifes trials will test you and shape you but don’t let them change who you are

its in those quiet little towns at the edge of the world that you will find the salt of the earth people who make you feel right at home

forget your voice sing

forget your feet dance

forget your life live

forget yourself and be

the most total opposite of pleasure is not pain but boredom for we are willing to risk pain to make a boring life interesting

isnt this enough just this world just this

believe in yourself your abilities and your own potential never let selfdoubt hold you captive you are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for

om aum the divine song is at the same time symmetry supersymmetry broken symmetry and the unbroken symmetry of nature

what a lover’s heart knows let no man’s brain dispute

if you have time to chatter

if you have time to read

walk into mountain desert and ocean

if you have time to walk

sing songs and dance

if you have time to dance

i understand once again that the greatness of god always reveals itself in the simple things

to create art with all the passion in ones soul is to live art with all the beauty in ones heart

to be a princess is to play at life to be a queen is to be a serious playerthe purpose of life as a woman is to ascend to the throne and rule with heart

all earthquakes and disasters are warnings there’s too much corruption in the world

and

poetry by suzy kassem

were all pieces of the same everchanging puzzle

some connected for mere seconds some connected for life

some connected through knowledge some through belief

never allow your ego to diminish your ability to listen

everyone has the fire but the champions know when to ignite the spark

the bird is gone and in what meadow does it now sing

if i am going to be drowned—if i am going to be drowned—if i am going to be drowned why in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea was i allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees

sometimes resilience arrives in the moment you discover your own unshakeable goodness

at this moment you are seamlessly flowing with the cosmos there is no difference between your breathing and the breathing of the rain forest between your bloodstream and the world’s rivers between your bones and the chalk cliffs of dover

god help us to live slowly

to move simply

to look softly

to allow emptiness

to let the heart create for us

when angels speak of love they tell us it is only by loving that we enter an earthly paradise they tell us paradise is our home and love our true destiny

everything smaller than heaven bores us because only heaven is bigger than our hearts

its not much you begin by thinking there is something extraordinary about it but youll find out when youve been out in the world a while longer unhappiness is the commonest thing there is

electricity was a reality in the universe when moses led the children of israel out of the land of egypt this is true of all natural laws they have always existed but only when understood may they be used

what im asking you to entertain is that there is nothing we need to believe on insufficient evidence in order to have deeply ethical and spiritual lives

receive with simplicity everything that happens to you

if you always attach positive emotions to the things you want and never attach negative emotions to the things you dont then that which you desire most will invariably come your way

he who does not reflect his life back to god in gratitude does not know himself

crazy horse dreamed and went into the world where there is nothing but the spirits of all things that is the real world that is behind this one and everything we see here is something like a shadow from that one

we tend to be preoccupied by our problems when we have a heightened sense of vulnerability and a diminished sense of power today see each problem as an invitation to prayer

peaceful is the one whos not concerned with having more or less

unbound by name and fame he is free from sorrow from the world and mostly from himself

to live was to be a fragment of the cosmere that was experiencing itself

if you have a good idea use it so that you will not only accomplish something but so that you can make room for new ones to flow into you

a nation or civilization that continues to produce softminded men purchases its own spiritual death on the installment plan

ive always been spiritual but ive never had a proper context and it took me a while to find the proper context its hard to realize you can have any kind of relationship with god you want and so i now have a punk rock relationship with god

there is far more spiritual potential within than most people realize the potential is so great that to define it in words would be impossible

the dripping blood our only drink

the bloody flesh our only food

in spite of which we like to think

that we are sound substantial flesh and blood

again in spite of that we call this friday good

they will become godly when they will have god in their hearts

from this point forward you don’t even know how to quit in life

and if you would know god be not therefore a solver of riddles

rather look about you and you shall see him playing with your children

and look into space you shall see him walking in the cloud outstretching his arms in the lightning and descending in rain

you shall see him smiling in flowers then rising and waving his hands in trees

a balanced inner calmness radiates from a peaceful centre it neither craves others approval nor rejects others presence it neither pulls towards nor pushes away it has a reverent attitude towards life and all its inhabitants

the real mission you have in life is to make yourself happy and in order to be happy you have to look at what you believe the way you judge yourself the way you victimize yourself

you and your purpose in life are the same thing your purpose is to be you

what drains your spirit drains your body what fuels your spirit fuels your body

you do not need to work to become spiritual you are spiritual you need only to remember that fact spirit is within you god is within you

when god takes out the trash dont go digging back through it trust him

a pure heart is superlatively rare and even more attractive

one can never fall in love you must rise to its level of consciousness love is not a feeling its a state of mind

the goal of prayer is to live all of my life and speak all of my words in the joyful awareness of the presence of god

prayer becomes real when we grasp the reality and goodness of gods constant presence with the real me jesus lived his everyday life in conscious awareness of his father

love one another love yourself then love will find you whole not half

understand the nature and influence of repeating patterns from childhood experiences or even from past lives wthout understanding patterns tend to repeat unnecessarily damaging the relationship

this silence this moment every moment if it’s genuinely inside you brings what you need there’s nothing to believe only when i stopped believing in myself did i come into this beauty

sit quietly and listen for a voice that will say ‘be more silent’ die and be quiet quietness is the surest sign that you’ve died your old life was a frantic running from silence move outside the tangle of fearthinking

your strength will be found when you stop struggling with yourself instead of thinking everyone is a struggle worth overcoming every obstacle in life is a lesson that teaches us not others

believe what you believe and it will be

believe what others believe and they will consume you

i can almost picture the disciples faces no not the drinkmyblood speech well never get on the list of fastestgrowing movements if you keep asking them to eat you

spirituality is not about being fixed it is about gods being present in the mess of our unfixedness messy spirituality

since the beginning of time spirituality and religion have been called to fill in the gaps that science did not understand

god is peace bliss beauty and truth focus your energy on that life will be like that

the queen is coming to reclaim her girls

spirituality is not adopting more beliefs and assumptions but uncovering the best in you

people who have had little selfreflection live life in a huge reality blindspot

i wish to spend a lifetime near a lighthouse where loneliness will be the glimmer of luminous prancing upon ocean waves… rising and falling only for my breathing

this fire that we call loving is too strong for human minds but just right for human souls

but no matter how much evil i see i think it’s important for everyone to understand that there is much more light than darkness

i dont think that god says go to church and pray all day and everything will be fine no for me god says go out and make the changes that need to be made and ill be there to help you

to know much and taste nothingof what use is that

i bought salvation from a man on the street he said go down to the beach and let the waves wash your feet

there was a time when people accepted magical experiences as natural there were no priests then and no one went chasing after the secrets of the occult

when we touch the place in our lives where sexuality and spirituality come together we touch our wholeness and the fullness of our power and at the same time our connection with a power larger than ourselves

to love someone is to desire and work toward their becoming the best version of themselves the one person in all the universe who can do this perfectly for you is god

reality isnt the way you wish things to be nor the way they appear to be but the way they actually are

my wealth is in my knowledge of self love and spirituality

the danger today is in believing there are no sick people there is only a sick society

i did not tell fat this but technically he had become a buddha it did not seem to me like a good idea to let him know after all if you are a buddha you should be able to figure it out for yourself

when we illuminate the road back to our ancestors they have a way of reaching out of manifesting themselvessometimes even physically

if your life is christ then your death will be only more of christ forever if your life is only christlessness then your death will be only more christlessness forever thats not fundamentalism thats the law of noncontradiction

there is a light within our soul that burns brighter than the sun and we ignore it

aloneness is a gift a beautiful gift to the human soul true and consistent satisfaction comes from the bond you form with yourself nobody else is a constant

true friends dont come with conditions

i dont argue things being spiritual vs scientific because ive never met anyone who knows enough about either to be convincingincluding myself

dreaming is what you do when your eyes are closedliving is what you do with that dream once you open your eyes

oh what a wonderful soul so bright inside you got power to heal the sun’s broken heart power to restore the moon’s vision too

never doubt god in the darkness what he has given us in the light

what is given to you is what is needed what you want requires giving up what you dont need

a life contemplating the blessings of christ becomes a life acting the love of christ

all spiritual journeys are martyrdoms

one must love god first and only then can one love ones closest of kin and neighbors we must not be idols to one another for such is not the will of god

the problem with certainty is that it is static it can do little but endlessly reassert itself uncertainty by contrast is full of unknowns possibilities and risks

what each of us believes in is up to us but life is impossible without believing in something

the christians whole desire at its best and highest is that jesus christ be praised it is always a wretched bastardization of our goals when we want to win glory for ourselves instead of for him

if you could really see that tree over there merlin said you would be so astounded that youd fall over

really but why asked arthur its just a tree

no merlin said its just a tree in your mind to another mind it is an expression of infinite spirit and beauty in gods mind it is a dear child sweeter than anything you can imagine

it is our collective and individual responsibility to preserve and tend to the environment in which we all live

if god were not only to hear our prayers as he does ever and always but to answer them as we want them answered he would not be god our saviour but the ministering genius of our destruction

these are the three stages of enlightenment the three glimpses of satori

the first stage enlightenment

a glimpse of the whole

the first stage of enlightenment is short glimpse from faraway of the whole it is a short glimpse of being

there is a gap a silence and emptiness where there is not thought between you and existence

you and existence meet and merge for a moment

and for the first time the seed the thirst and longing for enlightenment the meeting between you and existence will grow in your heart

the second stage of enlightenment

silence relaxation togetherness inner being

the second stage of enlightenment is a new order a harmony from within which comes from the inner being it is the quality of freedom

the inner chaos has disappeared and a new silence relaxation and togetherness has arisen

your own wisdom from within has arisen

a subtle ego is still present in the second stage of enlightenment

the hindus has three names for the ego

ahamkar which is the ordinary ego

asmita which is the quality of amness of no ego it is a very silent ego not aggreessive but it is still a subtle ego

atma the third word is atma when the amness is also lost this is what buddha callas noself pure being

in the second stage of enlightenment you become capable of being in the inner being in the gap in the meditative quality within in the silence and emptiness

for hours for days you can remain in the gap in utter aloneness in god

still you need effort to remain in the gap and if you drop the effort the gap will disappear

love meditation and prayer becomes the way to increase the effort in the search for god

then the second stage becomes a more conscious effort now you know the way you now the direction

the third stage of enlightenment

ocean wholeness noself pure being

at the third stage of enlightenment at the third step of satori our individual river flowing silently suddenly reaches to the ocean and becomes one with the ocean

at the third satori the ego is lost and there is atma pure being you are but without any boundaries the river has become the ocean the whole

it has become a vast emptiness just like the pure sky

the third stage of enlightenment happens when you have become capable of finding the inner being the meditative quality within the gap the inner silence and emptiness so that it becomes a natural quality

you can find the gap whenever you want

this is what tantra callas mahamudra the great orgasm what buddha calls nirvana what lao tzu calls tao and what jesus calls the kingdom of god

you have found the door to god

you have come home

god is so immense that if he were too visible people would give forced compliance without expressing their heart so god made it possible in enormous love for us to live as if he were not there

there was a time when skepticism was an act of rebellion since to a degree i both believe in evolution and have faith i can only conclude that as prophesied to have faith will someday be an act of rebellion

enlightenment is the complete flowering of body mind and the soul

you know how it goes

at some point in your life

i havent any language weak enough to depict the weakness of my spiritual life if i weakened it enough it would cease to be language at all as when you try to turn the gasring a little lower still and it merely goes out

tom dancer’s gift of a whitebark pine cone

you never know

what opportunity

is going to travel to you

or through you

once a friend gave me

one of a few

he found in the scat

and did what i supposed

he was sure i would do

the music echoes in the emptiness it reminds us where we came from and where we’re bound

so learn how much youre worth to god revel in that information and then walk in it

we are the masters of each moment

now the proper good of a creature is to surrender itself to its creator  to enact intellectually volitionally and emotionally that relationship which is given in the mere fact of its being a creature when it does so it is good and happy

science and truth are simple phenomenon of nature but it is the known that is preventing us from mastering the unknown

love gives you eyes

courage is often associated with aggression but instead should be seen as a willingness to act from the heart

…the work of the muslim sufi dervish community

was to open the heart

explore the mystery of union

and to celebrate the glory and difficulty

in being in human incarnation

when we refer to the biblical approach to economics or the biblical response to politics or biblical womanhood were using the bible as a weapon disguised as an adjective

thoughts words emotions  deeds not coming from love are likely coming from fear

buddhism is all about science if science is the systematic pursuit of the accurate knowledge of reality then science is buddhism buddhism is science

in the spiritual body moreover man appears such as he is with respect to love and faith for everyone in the spiritual world is the effigy of his own love not only as to the face and the body but also as to the speech and the actions

an atom at random in space

my soul dwells in regions ethereal

the top  of the people who are most creative constructive and thoughtful do not have much to do with churches to them the canons of reason come first making faith secondary and questionable

men and women often judge what they dont really know

he who knows all the answers but none of the questions is like a large gobbling bird on thanksgiving

to create a community where faith matters not just in theory but in reality faith has to be a public value not just a private one

we have very little faith in the lord very little trust if we trusted the lord as much as we trust a friend when we ask him to do something for us neither we as individuals nor our whole country would suffer so much

the incarnation is an essential part of jesusshaped spirituality

the unqualified affirmation of the univeral will of salvation has radically changed the way of conceiving the mission of the church in the world    the work of salvation is a reality which occurs in history

from the sexual side of spirituality

the more you understand your true spiritual identity and your connection with the supreme the easier it will be to love your self

i know i know moore said mad beliefs like that eh must be some metaphor right must mean something else shook his head what an awfully arrogant thing what if faiths are exactly what they are and mean exactly what they say

stop trying to make sense of it and just listen dane said

and what moore said if a large part of the reason theyre so tenacious is that theyre perfectly accurate

jesus never asked me to give to an organization the kind of exclusive devotion he demands from his disciples over and over jesus calls people to himself  out of the church the culture the economy and the family

jesus is compelling in the way the discovery of the stars or the experience of a oneofakind romance is compelling his presence draws you in to the deep

jesus christ its like living with stevie bloody nicks i said only without the cocaine which would be more fun

one reason might be that if i hadnt tripped id have been hamburger

and that leads me to my insight god was not there at the beginning of evolution god is what lies at the end of it

and for the sake of humilitya characteristic crucial to sacred questioning we might do well to confess that were capable at any moment of such bad religion ourselves

presently the newly awakened psychology will gradually accomplish what pure religious devotion might have done throw out paul and let jesus in

through this awareness earth souls can progress more and gain a clearer understanding of life after death

there are too many closed minds on the earth plane we are asking earth souls to open their minds and souls that’s the only way they will progress back to the universe

in the universe progress and learning never stop it is eternal

growth and development in the universe is far more rewarding than any rewards found on the earth plane – as long as the soul is willing to work

the pyramids are very spiritual and they represent the universe’s triad

the pyramids were given to earth by the universe and thought power built them

you were the ocean

and we were the land

you lay down unflinching

you lay down forgetting

we will suffer we will never win

wise individuals frequently say very little but what they do say hits the mark such remarks often remain in the mind of the recipient for a long time possibly a lifetime

faith changes us  faith in something intrinsically good something other than ourselves something bigger than ourselves

if love isnt there nothing will grow if it is there is always hope and it will win in the end love is vital and sacrosanct

every grievance you hold hides a little more of the light of the world from your eyes until the darkness becomes overwhelming everything you forgive restores that light so ask yourself who is it that you are really hurting

we are spiritual beings  indestructible immaterial and safe

there is a depth to life which only comes from our connection to other people however we have to find it without becoming a prisoner

no crime is a means to an end no crime can be rationalized

if one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty

people often associate complexity with deeper meaning when often after precious time has been lost it is realized that simplicity is the key to everything

pleasure brings pain but inner silence brings nothing negative it is in itself of great value and is a far better way to be than to be in ego states

even the juncture in history and the zeitgeist we live in is something we choose setting the scene for the spiritual fodder we need to grow and achieve deeper elevation of our souls

come to think of it maybe god is a he after all because only a cruel force would create something this beautiful and make it inaccessible to most people

the music plays    and your sense of reality is heightened to a dream

love one another if we took those simple words to heart wed already be the buddhas jesus wanted us to be

our thoughts are not roadblocks to our meditation they are the divine expression of the universe and the building blocks of infinite possibilities available to us in every moment

i write because i hopei write because i have faith

hopehope alike a fresh flower grows in the sand of my heart

faithfaith alike the sea will be perishing only when sea disappears

when you can quiet the fluctuations of your mind and drift into stillness  silence you can finally hear the whispers of your heart… the whispers of god

if the way of wisdom was easy anyone would have walked in wisdom is not a whore she is a shy mademoiselle so only those who strives wins her heart

history has been written but it has not always been right or complete

going beyond thoughts is merely to reduce the multiplicity of your thought

thoughts lead to words words to language language to action

action to realization and back again to thoughts

for the mind is made up of words language and logic until it dissolves into consciousness

my god can do it

my god will do it

but let’s not kid ourselves

we all know the ultimate motive to rise back from the dead is vengeance

it is not objective proof of gods existence that we want but whether we use religious language for it or not the experience of gods presence

just as a candle cannot burn without fire men cannot live without a spiritual life

all this wondering was the weather vane on top of the building of unrest and of discontent

every characteristic absence of spirituality every piece of common vulgarity is due to an inability to resist a stimulus  you have to react you follow every impulse

by lakes and sandy shores beneath the crags

of ancient mountains and beneath the clouds

which image in their bulk both lakes and shores

himself in all and al things in himself

great universal teacher he shall mold

thy spirit and by giving  make it ask

it wasnt because the music got so bad that i quit going to mass but it certainly was the beginning of my doubts about papal infallibility

probably our lives are full of symbols which only an unacknowledged sense perceives spiritual events assume a material guise in accordance with some creative principle but do not insist on recognition absolute evil

the ego is like a clever monkey which can coopt anything even the most spiritual practices so as to expand itself

when religious groups in a conflict eliminate the personal element and perceive themselves as representatives of collectives heir actions tend to become more radical and merciless ch by jaco cilliers p

peace and supreme joy may seem like endstates to practitioners on more difficult spiritual paths but the path of devotion should be filled with peace and joy from the very beginning their absence is an indication that something is amiss

the best religion or practice is the one that makes us better

both life and death offer us a choice the experience of death lasts a short time and has less variety but the adventure of living is longer and offers us more options

a practitioner of any spiritual path must have complete confidence that his adopted path is for him superior to all others

men should not be sexing their women in the missionary position because they are facing away from the sky instead of looking down men are to look up to the vastness of father sky

magic is not a cure for troubles it is a spiritual map your energies are the compass meditation will not fix a person it empowers individuals to find what they need to repair themselves

i prayer a poem

i prayer know no hour no season no day no month nor year

no boundary no barrier or limitation–no blockade hinders me

there is no border or wall i cannot breach

i move inexorably forward distance holds me not

i span the cosmos in the twinkling of an eye

i knowest it all

i am the most powerful force in the universe

who then is my equal

canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook

none is so fierce that dare stir him up

surely i may’st with but a word

who then is able to stand before me

i am the wind the earth the metal

i am the very empyrean vault of heaven herself

i span the known and the unknown beyond

eternity’s farthest of edges

and whatsoever under her wings is mine

i am a gentle stream a fiery wrath

penetrating wearing down mountains

–the hardest and softest of substances

i am a trickling brook to fools of want

lost in the deserts of their own desires

i am a niagara to those who drink in well

i seep through cracks i inundate

i level forests kindleth unto a single burning bush

my hand moves the universe by the mind of a child

i withhold treasures solid from the secret stores

to they who would wrench at nothing

i do not sleep or eat feel not fatigue nor hunger

i do not feel the cold nor rain or wind

i transcend the heat of the summer’s day

my time is impeccable by it worlds and destinies turn

i direct the fates of nations and humankind

my words are iron eternaled—rust not they away

no castle keep nor towers of beaten brass

nor the dankest of dungeon helks

nor adamantine links of handwrought steel

can contain my spirit–i shan’t turn back

the race is ne’er to the swift nor battle to the strong nor wisdom to the wise or wealth to the rich

for skills and wisdom i give to the sons of man

i take wisdom and skills from the sons of man

for they are ever mine

blessed is the one who finds it so for in

for those who have fallen on the battlefield

for my name’s sake i reach down to lift them up

from on high

i am a rose with the thorn

i am the clawing lion that pads her children

my kisses wound those whom i love my kisses are faithful

no occasion moment in time instances epochs ages or eras hold me back

time–past present and future is to me irrelevant

i span the millennia i am the everpresent now

my foolishness is wiser than man’s

my weakness stronger than man’s

i am subtle to the point of formlessness yet formed

i have no discernible shape no place into which the

enemy may sink their claws

i am wisdom and in length of days knowledge

strength is mine and counsel and understanding

i break i build by me kings rise and fall

the weak are given strength wisdom to those who seek and foolishness to both fooler and fool alike

i lead the crafty through their deceit

i set straight paths for those who will walk them

i am he who gives speech and sight  and confounds and removes them

when i cut straight and true is my cut

i strike without fault i am the razored edge of

i have no enemy nor friend

my zeal and love and mercy will not relent

to track you down until you are spent–

even unto the uttermost parts of the earth

i cull the proud and the weak out of the common herd

i hunt them in battles royale until their cries unto heaven are heard

i break hearts–those whose are harder than granite

beyond their atomic cores i strike their atomic clock

elect motions not one more or less electron beyond electron’s orbit that has been ordained

for you do i give–for his grace is sufficient for thee until he desires enough

then i prayer move on as a comet

striking out of the black

i his sword kills to give life

i am living and active the divider asunder

of thoughts and intents

i am the light of eternal mind

and i prayer

am prayer almighty

you don’t have to wander around in silk robes burning sage with crystals tied to your head to find the power within

when you’re outnumbered by trees your perspective shifts

in dreams we accept truth much quicker than in the waking world

it is conducive to serenity to see the vast majority of people as the children they are spiritually and intellectually

our survival is a result not of caution or wisdom but of pure luck

happiness is an inevitable result of embracing and unhappiness that of rejecting what is

excessive thinking and more so attachment to thoughts dominate our daily activities but why the mind thinks but you must not it is a choice remember you are not your thoughts

the first step to selfrealization is the realization of the fact that no one can give you freedom

fate is waiting she can heal she is unpredictable but not unkind

no matter how lightly a person steps they cannot avoid some tragedies

to be wholly selfaware one must give in to the unknown

i believe in the possibility of everything

all people have the ability to feel for others through empathy

a mountain is not nearly as much a wonder as a mosquito

the golden rule applies to everyone not just the living

in a society of painkillers people seem to forget that pain has a purpose it is there to tell us when we’re ailing so we can pinpoint the issue and potentially alleviate it

knowledge may be power but how one utilizes it is the generator

you are a conductive being harness that power and transform it into something you love

if you live a happy full life and spread love and kindness wherever you go the naysayers will get drowned out by your light

people who are seeking emotional support find it in the craft because instead of looking to a savior or prophet we are taught to save ourselves

death comes for everyone it’s a natural part of life we’re all on loan

never ask for too much it’s sabotage

people are just people some of us hold the same beliefs some of us do not

not to fix the spirit was to seek death and that was the same as to seek nothing since death was going to overtake us regardless of anything

you are your ultimate home

a house is not defined by how many rooms or stories it has i always judge a place by what kind of energies it gives off

plants are the ultimate symbols of life

doing is often a subconscious escape from being

your beautiful mind perfect body and expressive emotions—they are what make you unique they are all vehicles of your soul

when you are embodying your essential self any choice you make is the right one in all scenarios there is no room for complaints or uncertainty

there is absolutely nothing you can do get or accomplish that could make you any worthier of goodness than you are at this exact moment

chapter one the dawn and the dread

heartbeat heartbeat comes from valhallan way

to meet down in judgment to ply its trade

two →swords← to join in worthy cross

actions to be rendered one to be lost

she did come now from ’yond northern slope

a day of reckoning did she again once hope

a devout meeting was her qwesterly bane

to stay her hand was to go insane

st kari of the blade to meet her past

rode kari she her charger on down

past the dead land where gaul sat crowned

a killing job yea she desired to lastly kill

to set things right so her heart might lie still

upon the mist and roaring plain

she entered in a soul uncontained

a fierce wind in deed and forever freed

enemies she annihilhates ’tis hur’ creed

her own advanced guard of a sort

multitudes to follow in her report

know this valkyrie from on cold

an ancient maiden soft and bold

a warrior spirit from ages past

solid in stature this eternal framed being

yet crippled within from internaled bleedings

a sword saint so refined in the poetic art

a noble character yet with a banshee’s heart

rhythmed horse now to the beats

kari emboldened amid the sleet

beyond the mountain she does come

far from that murderous deadlands ground

the land up swells the dead still abound

traverses she those bygones of leprous civilizations

those cities crumbled by the exhalted of oblivions

stark traces etched now bare in the land

that are no more again save dust in the hand

a cool stream now in desert sans

does more good when one is damned

stopped she her mount to admire the flow

a lovely stream with skeletons packed below

cold water chortles rushtish with tint

told of past carnage it whetted her glint

fallen warriors they are no more

swirls and eddies mark their discord

gurgled shouts slung and gathered

faces glazed while steel lathered

refreshing though it was to her mouth

she smelled an air she flared about

came up that ridge of loud sanded hill

below a man and his halfscore of kills

kari’s eyes waxed in smug contempt

possibilities ran deep with no repent

all of your anxiety is because of your desire for harmony seek disharmony and you will gain peace

spirit cannot be killed thats what the harbingers say

only filled or spilled and that alone on your appointed day

tis an harrowing hour when naked souls stand in blazed or putrid breeze

to gain the prize immortal or to the gates of hell must flee

to till or to mill that is the key

choose the path of the way to be

actions are the louder expression of thought the quality of thought is ordered by the nature of our inner belief and faith

games that are played and always won

often bring the tragedy of victory

and songs that must be sung

kari garden of the dragons vil iii

games that are played and sometimes lost

often bring the joy of loss that learns our course

valkyrie kari garden of the dragons vol iii

people who dont understand want to know but people who know dont want to understand

to say enlightenment is the objective of the universe is the most compassionate lie ever

first build a little faith upon life then jump

dont forget to pray because god didnt forget to wake you up this morning

if you only pray when you are in trouble you are in big trouble

i remember feeling dimly that there was a kind of blackmail in it people i felt ought to love the lord because they loved him and not because they were afraid of going to hell

my spirituality is the spirituality of love you give love to the universe and the universe reflect back the refined love back to you because love is allpervading divine and the ultimate godliness

there are dreams that remain hidden

deep inside of you

that are never shattered

and are never taken from you

and that is the dream to be completely free

completely yourself

and completely at one with all of life

the dream of fulfilment

the dream of love

the dream of eternal life

drink in the heat of an ancient sun

held in the cold fire of water rising

from earth and rock

spilling over your cupped hands

and drawn to lips and tongue

pouring water’s memory

of the azure mist it fell from

into the chalice of your flesh

turning your eyes skywards

with desire

for the freedom it was born of

poetry is the language of mysticism

discourse it is the whisper in the dark

the shadow in the light poetry is an incantation from the depths of your very soul

we worship the form and seek the formless the nameless is sought by reciting names with closed hands closed minds we seek him

instead of forcing yourself to feel positive allow yourself to be present in the now

helping a human is equivalent of a hundred pilgrimages

no pilgrimage is holier than compassion no gospel is truer than kindness no offering is grander than love

he laughed for a brief second and looked around to check if nobody was there and then asked me you really want to know

yes i do i replied everything about him was so interesting and mysterious that i wanted to know more

then come closer he requested

as i went close to him he whispered in my ear my connection to other dimension appears as madness to them i see what they cannot see i feel what they cannot feel don’t share with them they won’t believe you he replied with a wink

we seek peace in wars build barriers to feel free our doing is our undoing

your seeking is your becoming and it comes with a consequence

samadhi is you dying in your own lap

samadhi is you dying in your own lap

god is in the mountain god is in the sea god is in everybody… god is in you and me

we are spiritual coinhabitants of a spiritual world

the greatest gift we can give the world is our own evolution

call unto the stars

carry as the river

which carries the touch of the forest

enliven within my body of woman

union with earth union with sky

i am daughter of stars

my soul it is flowing

body of earth woven with light

brahman is pure consciousness while matter is disillusioned consciousness  both cannot exist at once you cannot sleep and wake up at once

it’s not a theory neither a hypothesis it’s a fact

whatever our present it is not magic… it may be good it may be tragic… it depends on what we did in the past karma will decide until when it will last

how sad that for some the idea of god is the perfect excuse to see problems in their life and do nothing about it

eternity isnt a place its a position

spirituality is not running away from the battle field of life spirituality is blossoming every dimension of life with love responsibility equanimity creativity and compassion

life has many petals spirituality is unfolding those petals with with love responsibility equanimity creativity and compassion

do not rely on the outer world as your measuring stick for your own spiritual growth rely on your response to the outer world to determine how much you have grown

is it possible to rediscover life within the limits of a mind that is still basically unaware of what can be experienced beyond the mind

we are to love

it is to be shared

enthusiastically we should be in love with life

this is my wish to you

i hope that you are joyfully alive

i offer you love

indeed you inspire me

you are my sunshine

we are of spirit

its essence can always be felt

therefore let it shine

living can be so wonderful

awaken and experience the sun

we only need to share care and forgive

loving life is to love each other

this is a humanmade world

however it has gone rotten

to live is to love and to give is to get

this is the one that should never be forgotten

we are each of this one spirit

this energy of life is the link that unites us

what is life energy where does it come from we may never know it is a mystery that the mind can never comprehend this poem is about sunshine furthermore it is about you me and sharing the gift of life

i enjoy the sunshine

how about you

however its true significance is often forgotten

do you remember

it is possible to experience it now in this moment

this is because you have always known that it is there

it is life

awaken and allow it to shine

you may sayokay but the sun is not always shining

this is indeed an odd thing to say

what then

where is the sun on a cloudy day

it is always there don’t you feel it

it is a light that glows very bright

it is a vibrating frequency

this energy is not only out there

it is here now in you

the mind can not understand

however often it may try

there beyond the mind is the one that knows

the warmth of this energy is always felt

we are engulfed in its beauty

likewise we are always bathing in its caress

the intensity is strong

it is as if my heart will explode

these are the moments of divine awareness

this is the moment when i am peaceful serenity abounds

a cloud may appear even in a moment that is so clear

but the sunshine this energy will shine through

be active be aware feel what is always there

we are very lucky

a human beingthis is what we are that is a fact

however you and i are so much more then that

the face in the mirror masks your true self

we are ultimately this energy

it is here there and everywhere

this is a priceless treasure

it is life

it is within our body heart and soul

we are to love

it is to be shared

enthusiastically we should be in love with life

this is my wish to you

i hope that you are joyfully alive

i offer you love

this is the one that should never be forgotten

we are each of this one spirit

this energy of life is the link that unites us

everything and everybody is the same this is the mystery and the end

i don’t want the void i don’t want fantasies i want some thing real—not another fragment of truth to puzzle over

there’s something beyond all this we see hints in books and music

he closed the door but he knew that for those who seek to step beyond the threshold the door is always open you need only turn the knob

all successful people are not happy but all happy people are successful

pain as a lifeform in a universe of objects is unavoidable but suffering is a choice

it’s just a drama we come and we go why fear why worry just enjoy the show

communication and openness are essential in nurturing understanding fairness and respect

you ‘think’ that you want or need to love and this is what stops you from truly loving

is god a statue is god a saint no god is a power that no artist can paint

in that moment the flare that i sent leaves him and the negative energies that you released on the earth know this and they make use of it to destroy the released potential all the masters who lived in the world dealt with it

i the son and the father are one

we as well as other objects in the universe are unified through the manifestation of life it is possible for us to consciously awaken and nurture this dimension of life energy consciousness

man has invented googlethrough which anything we can findbut have you ever wondered who created the mind

you do not have to fight and struggle to build a better life

the secret is in being satisfied and happy with where you are and still working everyday for the betterment

she played the keys of my heart gently yet sensually setting my soul on fire

embracing who you are now will allow you to be who you will become your true essence will fully blossom spontaneously through this simple acknowledgement

the key to embracing who you are is experienced now however it is never about focusing on the now instead it is about being the now

if only we realize who we are and who god is we will find everlasting happiness

when we give our attention and love to anything in life it is a significant offering we only have so much time what we spend it on and who we give it to will determine the course of our life

it is important that we surround ourselves with positive imagery the colors alone can affect our moods but i also believe that the overall message can change our minds lift our spirits and nourish our souls

belief is more powerful than knowledge you know dont you why be afraid ifyou are me and i am you

this strangeness is so different as if i know it somehow its not strange anymore like to me you are now

all your emotions will reach an epitome thats the time you shall collapse to start building yourself all over again

what you want to be is neither big nor small when you recognize the divinity within you whether you are a celebrity or a layman would not really matter

when you tap on the demon within you you will forget to fear the ghosts outside

cruelty is cheap easy and chickenshit thats also a touchstone of my spiritual beliefs

awaken for life is only a fleeting moment between coming and going

lose everything but not soul gain anything but first soul

progress is not gauged by improvement in the comfort of our situation progress happens when the situation is adverse and we remain normal

the whole world is a miraculous blessing if a child can see this simple truth then the man or woman who cannot is truly lost even so the lost can be found and the child in all of us although maybe silenced can be found again

to realize god first we must realize who we are once we realize the self we will realize god

man is so busy creating cosmetics for the skin that he has not discovered what lies within

if you have an ego bigger than your body grow a bigger body your ego won’t shrink

if you have an ego bigger than your soul grow a bigger soul your ego won’t shrink

you are the dayyou are the night

drop all your judgments all your fight

be your natural self and become the universal light

oh what a difference a single difference makes

life is like accounting it is best when everything is in balance

spirituality was my safe haven and the daily  minutes meditation was my private zone where i got lost somewhere deep within myself but outside of this i was intense and still battling with myself

when the body is healthy and whole – you do not feel it when some physical pain or mental suffering draw your attention – only then you feel your body

in the same manner – when human mind is healthy and whole – you no longer feel yourself personal identity is a sign of sick and unhealthy mind selfidentification is a disease of duality of running mind

in reality – to know – is not to know to be – is not to be

carpe diem means seize the day make the best of it in every way dont lose a moment come what may forget about tomorrow just live today

he lights the divine flame

that you nurture with devotion

in time your every atom knows

you’re not a wave but the eternal ocean

to know god study woman

a meditative mind gathers no karma

we think we are this but in reality we are that not the body that we look like but the spirit in fact

nowhere in the definition of religion is there a mandate for religions to selfchallenge or revamp their theological positions based on new enlightenment rather a religion adopts a central orthodoxy and perpetuates it

because the brain does not possess robust ‘fault detectors’ the brain will just as easily encode irrational thoughts and beliefs just as it will rational ones

on the human soul

to challenge the verity of one’s own beliefs is to be courageous to separate the truth

from falsity is to be wise to take action against the headwinds of the status quo is to be a

pioneer the troika of courage wisdom and a pioneering spirit elevates our enlightenment to the construct and elegance of true reality

you are always the totality of anything no matter what you experience or confront

how would it be to not do anything in a given moment does this sound impossible this is easier than the mind thinks it is often about letting go and allowing instead of making something happen this nonreaction opens the portal to stillness

please focus on this simple realization there is only every now and how you interact with this moment decides everything that you are experiencing

you are divine accept it

no thought

no concept

no identity

no personality

no religion

no country

no imemyself

no goal

no time

no search

no conflict

right nowright here  i am nameless undivided unlimited untouched source of life in which bodies come and go like waves in the ocean

the highest feeling is the experience of unity with all that is this is the great return to truth for which the soul yearns this is the feeling of perfect love

give me a little space in your heart and i shall sing to you the hearbeat of freedom

those who seek god in isolation from their fellow men unless trebly armed for the perils of the quest are apt to find not god but a devil whose countenance bears an embarrassing resemblance to their own

as a writer i program my self and others

we are light sound color and form living a physical reality add the element of love and you have everything

sanyans is a biggerthanlife phenomenon awakening is a biggerthanexistence phenomenon

dreams are reflections reflections are generally inverted

when you pray you are sending a message forward to a time you will not see

you get so alone sometimes that it just makes sense you are being pushed out of your comfort zone

spend sometime with yourself the best thing you can do to yourself

what we need is not truths which will serve us but a truth which we may serve

man rather doubts a buddha’s light than his own darkness

evolve untill gods look puny to you

human body is the universe itself compressed into an intelligible size

at any point in time – it is the state of your attention that defines your level of existence as human beings

in your waking state – flowing attention trapped in thoughts make you a private person

in your sleeping state – still attention free from thoughts make you an universal perceiver

in your natural state – absolute attention as it is naturally returns to its source and make you the peaceful pure presence

however in reality – only supreme source exists in all the above mentioned states

to feel the supreme source – you do not need the senses

to know the supreme source – you do not need the thoughts

the only way to know the source is to be the source

no matter where i am

this moment is my eternal home

no matter what i do

stillness is my only act

now when i look at the universe  i see myself

and when i look at myself  i see the universe

behind the net of all your mindmade memories thoughts desires

shines the light of your own being

see it  be it

when you look at things without any personal judgments or interpretation

you see reality as it is

dont care  what was and what will be

you are already what you need to be

flow in this moment and see

stillness is the key to be free

to work in the dark you must be able to hold your own light and still be intimate with the darkness

holding onto misery only brings more misery into focus all possibilities exist but the mind has only room for one thing at a time

life must be taken a step at a time all else is madness

things are often not what they seem and then sometimes they are the trick is to learn what is real

the echo is a gift passed on to us by our ancestors many ages ago to remind us of ourselves to confirm our existence to remedy our loneliness though we must be still in order to hear it

if this is a dream i hope i remember it

we think our world into being

to be human is to be whole but to fail to see this wholeness

the moon speaks in slivers and halves

the ears are the eyes of the dark as the stars are the eyes of the night sky

a word is a bridge it is a wave of light and sound that spans the perceived distance between one thing and another

the world is as big as our ideas of it

existence is one selfloving event this is who you are this is what all is we are this oneselfexperiencing reality that is love itself we are love we are this one that is love itself

man is an incomplete being he needs to connect thus social a sanyasin is on his path to completion he needs to disconnect thus asocial buddhas are complete beings they are simultaneously connected and disconnected thus beyond both

unlike animals man is conscious about his incompleteness thus he is restless and thus he has nonanimalistic potentials

material things become economically useful only as they receive man’s spiritual response

the culture of an age is determined according to the degree of awakening of the conscious life of its people which develops and control the form of materialistic production distribution and consumption

sometimes i have trouble telling my dreams from reality the farther i travel from some experience the more unsure i am that it actually happened just like a dream the closer i am to it the more sure i am that its real

the one that looks beyond the mind knows there is only one truth to find there among the highs and lows in and outs and ups and downs remains a stillness every unbound

try to enjoy the present  for that is all we have yesterday is but a memory and tomorrow is yet a dream…

prometheus stole fire from the gods we are each the heirs of that divine spark used wisely the spark fuels ones journey and lights the way treated carelessly the spark consumes its owner and everything in its path

every answer can be followed by another question

what is life perception how we perceive it corresponds with how we feel in any given moment perception and awareness go handinhand true awareness is a state of presence or oneness

live consciously in the moment and experience the unity of life within you through you and around you

she had no voice so she gave it to the devil

once you have a glimpse of the whole life becomes unquestionable

question it now

once your head opens up to the existence meditation becomes impossible

meditate now

but i wonder how to convey

the sound that is of a rain

and the song that is of a river

when you no longer care what the world thinks about you then only you can rebel and to rebel is the only way to born again

some things in life are worth fighting for

god replies that all it really proves is that some men will follow any order no matter how asinine as long as it comes from a resonant wellmodulated voice

i have been given so much in life merely for knowing how to ask for it

live for your obsession that you are meant to be

die for your passion that you are born to be

i and god are one

knowledge is the tip of the iceberg whereas wisdom is the entire iceberg

you do not come and then must go you are constant eternally so…do not look out there to find what you already know

no soul doesn’t exist on personal level there’s nothing like your soul and my soul what looks unique in individuals is just another layer of mind

i am learning from you and you from me therefore we share gratitude and love because we are one

you will never experience the true self by using the mind in an attempt to find it

now i am aware i am presence

the key to discovering presence depends on your ability to observe yourself and releasing all demands placed on the moment at hand

be gone details of a mortal world i am what i am and i shall always be free the nothingness of this moment is the essence of existence

from the ashes greater consciousness shall rise

when someone dies we think that’s it for them but it’s not really set up that way it’s not fixed death like life is temporary

as above so below

today there are very few unicorns left and not many witches or wizards but there is always magic—the power to create sufficient conditions for spirits to manifest to bring consciousness from the realms of potential into the world of action

with droplets of music

god is a weakling he’s quite scared of you far weaker than air and water formless be so non violent you won’t hurt a fly then only he appears

god is a weakling

don’t scare away god not even unintentionally

it’s quite a funny law in god’s kingdom meekness is strength this space formed from formlessness guess how strong ithe must be

but in man’s kingdom god is a weakling

you feel bad if an infant is scared of you no

far weaker than an infant when it comes to tender things how careful you must be realized

god is a weakling

god is a weakling far weaker than air and water formless be so non violent you won’t hurt a fly then only he appears god is a weakling

the highway of atmosphere in the early morning is very pure for your soul experience the bliss

call jesus the only son of god and god dies call muhammad the last messenger of god and god dies no god ain’t fucking dead yet god doesn’t die until the last man walks on earth god doesn’t die untill some primitive life swims on a puddle

and one day even if life completely disappears from existence god will find some other way god knows how to beget sons and daughters god knows how to animate his messages

call jesus the only son of god and god dies call muhammad the last messenger of god and god dies no god ain’t fucking dead yet god doesn’t die until the last man walks on earth god doesn’t die untill some primitive life swims on a puddle

the truth of the stars reflects through all of us

on the planet where the shadows roam the end is always within sight

i finally spoke my voice trembling hello…son i love you i made you i’m your god i will always be there for you i will do everything i can to keep you safe

my love for him was so strong

adam just looked at me intrigued he then smiled and opened his arms in a wide embrace i started crying feeling his tight hold over me

he then released his grip and said one word daddy

all gods are worthless if your inner godliness remains asleep all through your life

when i came to you

a butterfly came too

and feelings started anew

do you remember it

but most of all

do you believe in signs

you wanted greater things

but love forces all of us down

and sorrow bows us still harder

they bend us back where we began

are there not in the hallowed night

things that are straight and true

so i learned

for never as mortal teachers do

have you my deities

upholders of all things

led me with caution

the gods say to humans

and learn by that nourishment

to give thanks for all things

and know what it is to be free to quit

and go where you like

dear lord i am tall even they try to cut me short through the falls i am still standing thank you

once you wake up to a better knitted reality life becomes maya an illusion

when we worship god we worship a being our experience does not give us the tools to understand if we could god would not inspire awe

—blue like jazz by donald miller

love isn’t a spell not if it’s the sort of love that wakes us up then it’s a spellbreaker not a spellmaker

when something is perfect it looks plain

once we knit biology to the canvas of consciousness things get enough complicated already let alone culture science and other conditionings layered on top of them

third eye isnt something we add to our already existing two eyes rather its their deeper communion

it’s the inner eye that opens as two outer fleshmade eyes it’s the inner eye that opens as ears and nose and tongue too human body is just an opening up of the soul to this material realm

how can one be humble when existence resides inside him

how can one not be humble when only existence resides inside him

it’s quite a funny law in god’s kingdom meekness is strength

mind is the subtle existence existence is the grosser mind

counterintuitively ego itself is the proof man is a soulwith being a mere  lbs body wouldn’t dare claim the moon and the ocean the sun and the stars

man’s ego is the shadow of his own soul

don’t call me human i feel belittled consiousness is my size dont’t call me earthly i feel belittled existential is my size

buddhas are innocent beings they can easily be judged yet judging a buddha is the worst thing humanity keeps on doing to itself

living on mind is dreaming no matter your eyes are open or closed

waking up is strictly living beyond mind

a spiritually evolved person in a former lifetime could choose to have the experiences of spiritual blindness in this lifetime just to act as a catalyst for someone like you who needed to be more articulate about what you had come to realize

everything you do wih thoughts in mind is masturbation the real thing is somewhere else

that very way an infant goes to sleep an adult awakens

we belong eternally to the darkness and further eternally to the light

amongst all these chaos a bird always chirps listen to it

life is unquestionable we just somehow developed too many questions

everything you do with thoughts in mind is masturbation the real thing is somewhere else

the socalled complexities we encounter in daily activities are nothing more than misinterpretations of the now

it is never about getting somewhere or getting something rather it is about knowing where you are and what you are experiencing you then become the now of the experience instead of experiencing its content details

empty mind is fundamentally an eye it observes

you as a soul are the realization that you are

man is the sky turned inside out

he saw her light seeing his first look of both everything and only one thing all together at once all that ever did or ever will matter

what is an opinion of a man but a mere thought he thinks of someone or something based on a feeble speculation or halfhearted truth

my fellow man do not be swayed by what others think but concern your business with what god thinks  then ye shall succeed fret not because the possession of a perfect knowledge of your business is an absolute necessity in order to ensure success

i know one day we will awake as one and all the differences of two will disappear

i give you comfort i give you peace i give you joy i give you hope i give you life

jesus kept talking to her

i give you strength i give you love i give you power i give you me

jennifer started jumping up and down and hugging jesus

a sense of logic causes an understanding to true sensitivity in a sensational sense amuse the realm of celestial essence pleasantly speaking it brings pleasure to see a fleshly man become a supreme god in he

its treachery when one becomes godbody spiritually inclined to the mind of a godmentality the ability of divinity is at the peak of a snowy mountain give ear to my words as this liquid flows through a golden fountain

see i woke up to this godbody movement three eyes wide open to this godmind blueprint the dynamic of this climax at the peak of a godconscious is what i seek subliminally i speak fluent  figure mind i just do it

i have come to understand god as a mystery for whom it is a privilege to seek or even deny rather than as one for whom it is my obligation to perform

remember and honor our mothers always in the spiritual and physical realms

let your heart spread your light

simply stated you will get more of what you want if you are grateful for what you have

christianity is simply the illusion of being free to choose

lets lose ourselves in love so we can discover our selves as love for it is what we are love

i dont advocate for collectivism for i am the collective  i dont preach religion for i am religion  and i am no materialist for i am the matter and i am the spirit

how can you be holding me from doing what i want to do when all i want to do is hold you

romise yourself that whatever you know

whatever you feel whatever you see and whatever you

believe in they’re all yours and you are responsible for

whatever they do to you you’re the only master of your

compassion is a function of strength

life energy is manifesting through everything i am nothing and i am everything

active communication is the ability to exchange transmit or share information

our true nature lies beyond what we can see and it’s beyond what we cannot see it’s beyond the light and sound and it’s even beyond the frequency itself

happiness comes from without bliss comes from within happiness is dependent on other people and outer causes bliss is not dependent on outer causes

life is a much better experience without the minds definitions assumptions and interpretations

life energy is manifesting though everything i am nothing and i am everything

discover yourself as love because love it is you

a single drop of water can bring a flower to blossom therefore a single act of kindness can ripple out and touch all things in the universe

when we see the world superficially we see individuals who appear independent of each other we fail to see through our senses how deeply connected we are with each other at the spiritual level

motivation for an insincere person to reform should be that their company to those in their life is inherently inferior to that of sincere people

love strengthens soul connection and is the key to the success of all meaningful relationships

mind over matter matter is physical mind creates matter in the mental without mental what would become of the world

far more extreme what would become of the man living to live and not living to die would it be wrong to state that living to live is to love

if thy deed be sour thy fruit be sour

if thy deed be sweet thy fruit be like dripping honey satisfying

enlightenment is gained through ignorance ignorance proceeds sorrow pain and suffering

refinement through pain come wisdom and knowledge which in turn becomes enlightenment and to know better is to do better

take heed to the flow of knowledge that comes from the tree of truth

its roots grow deep within soil that stands not too far from a river of living water

the temple shall house you with confidence and peace its a fourth dimension type f peace where nothing rot  thieves cant break in its the kingdom of heaven on earth for those who seek from within

theres a spiritual war now erupting oppression is no longer a physical aspect but a spiritual  mental one oppression and slavery have modernized into this new era

the journey from innocence to experience is also often the journey from companionship and fellowship to isolation and solitude because once we learn feel or see what were meant to from those in our life they go away

promise yourself that whatever you know

whatever you feel whatever you see and whatever you

believe in they’re all yours and you are responsible for

whatever they do to you you’re the only master of your

in photography and as in life it is the strong contrasts between dualities that make things interesting and beautifulparticularly speaking darkness has to exist and be present in order for light to glow and have meaning and purpose

love can sometimes achieve the impossible just like light can sometimes shine through a rainstorm of clouds

i love you like i have never loved before

you and me and the butterfly

i hear you whispering will she come

i am wondering do you think of me

maybe you have something to say to me

she will tell you how i feel for you

i loved you because we are the same

i know you know i like you

whether youre angel or demon im in love

i tried to tell you our love is cursed

you do something magical to me

shes a miracle

our love is a wonder

we are in love i saw my face in yours

there is love and everyone can love

in your face i see your love for me

a thousand faces i saw in you

you make my heart beat faster than the speed of light

time stopped in the last time i saw you

my love is infinite

you make me feel like an astronaut

you liked me and light found me

i fell in love with you and i saw the light

i sacrifice my life to make you love me

my love for you will always exist

before we feel

you were always dressed

in black and grey

i came with my colors

and you changed

is this love

sometimes our prayers are not answered because we pray more with our mouths than with our hearts  nkwachukwu ogbuagu

spirituality is folding both the hands out of love in front of the cosmic divinity that is everywhere

welcome to the temple of today

an overcomer is a person that has been through various trials and has subdued the enemy

a believer is walking with the lord if he is constantly doing his will

the lord is only interested in bringing people to god a mission that he had to come down from heaven and die for

the lord has prepared a plan where you have grace if you abide in the lord’s will

if you want to reach god that journey starts on earth after that it is too late

you cannot have the holy ghost without the resurrected jesus

if you know the lord as being on the cross you are dead already it is as though the lord is still in the grave

god is only able to be reached through the resurrected jesus who is in heaven with the father

if you thought that you have to pray so that the lord can protect you from the enemy you were deceived you receive the lord’s protection as an entitlement as a citizen of the kingdom of god

yes you need to cross your ts and dot your isbut more importantly cross your bridges and open your eyes

love is the way across life love is your crossing love is the bridge that connects you to the only thing that matters

the lord has given to believers in him everything that they need to have a fresh experience with him on a daily basis

remember will ryde the human soul is like a torn garment attached to the divine by a single thread yet yearning for wholeness

its your spirit i love

the signs tell me you’re the one

the butterfly fetched butterflies in our chest

the butterfly doesn’t lie

our eyes met and the cloudy sky filled with light

i loved you and the next day i saw a rainbow

love burnt us and the world got on fire

its obvious i have a crush on you

the love we feel is not meant for days like this

im in a strange circle of love

i passed by your place but i didnt get in

habits form much more than our schedules they form our hearts

religion is a language if you can speak it its a bridge if not then its a barrier

you get what you focus on in life

you get what you focus on in life

blessings are gifts that are as a result of loving god

religion is the kindergarten to spirituality one cannot realize god without religion

good means life this is the realization of eternal life  fundamental laws of the world for ensuring eternal life

with my practical results i proved the possibility of complete restoration of destroyed matter  unified system of knowledge

for human to be able to understand that he works efficiently he has to do his private tasks through macrosalvation  the teaching of grigori grabovoi about god the dynamic structuring of the soul

the lord will not reward a person for doing the enemy’s will

the basic teaching of all religions is silence

a silence spread in our inner being the mind will begin to dissolve that silence unites you with truth when a person is ready to dissolve into silence his ego will disappear and he will not be separated from existence

a holy person means one who has become silent within a spiritual teacher is a death because the ego of the student will dissolve completely within the student arises a pure emptiness and samadhi is born

the lord will not bless a person who does not love him

a person who is blessed is the one that has been doing the lord’s will without ceasing

the lord has been seeking for men who are able to do his will

a man who needs god in his life is the one that will seek the lord so that he will live by the lord’s commands

the lord is not going to lead you to hopelessness

if you are a prophet you will need the gift of the word of knowledge even before the gift of prophecy is given to you

the lord is not going to curse anyone without a cause

a humble person is a person who has been gifted by the lord to have favour before both god and man

when you desire anything that is not from the human spirit it is called lust

the lord will use your human spirit to communicate with you through the holy spirit

the lord is not going to make it difficult for you to do his will he will rather help you do his will

the enemy is subtle he does not want the oppressed to know how active he is

if you are a religious person know that you are in a quest that will only lead you to death

a harlot is a person who has refused to fully give himself to the lord he is not willing to trust the lord and is seeking to gain from the lord and from the world

transcendence transfigures it does not reconcile but rather transmutes opposites into something surpassing them that effaces their oppositions

believe in yourself and you will find that you are

surrounded by real magic

accept who you really are and you will discover

a magic in it purest form

embarce your inner energy and radiate your

spiritual strenght liberate yourself

because you are the most powerful

tool in your life you are the magic

if you are human you are spiritual  if you are human you are religious  if you are human you are alive

the secret of meditation is radiating blessings from your heart outward to all the world

drawing a cross on your forehead wont get you into heaven for real heaven can only manifest around us on earth if we the individual humans start acting as civilized creatures of conscience and character

every relationship is a lesson in love

do not be afraid of love or the course it will take there is no certainty in life choose love first and choose love last and it will give you more than you ever give it

sadness was not an emotion anyone felt in heaven though crying was always expected and normal especially for those who met christ for the first time

healing has its own power and once started it moves ahead methodically knowing exactly what track to take for the most efficient and effective results

that voice you listen to is no friend it promises so much but when has it ever given you what it promised when has it ever given you any happiness longer than a fleeting moment it has your destruction as its goal not your happiness

the road is certain for anyone who ventures near it

time is not necessary for healing but it is generally inevitable

for you are love and as love you shall live eternally

for love is eternal

for you are love

faith brings comfort and strength to all of us but we must surrender to a higher power and when we do we are the most humble and the most powerful

when love touches us it dissolves the walls of mis understanding and builds a bridge that helps us walk towards each other

what would it be like to just let go of all that we believe about our existence and just live

oneness is experienced when you are aware of this moment as yourself then as the other object and then as the one universal self you may sense that everything within close proximity and beyond becomes a deep conscious spiritual occurrence

you are consciously awakened and aware now it is time to spread your wings to fly

life is about dancing in the rain while the sun sings its music and the rainbows deliver hope

it is in being totally and fully present with ourselves

that we can live a whole lifetime in a single moment

the bad must exist in order for the good to become greater

contemplation is a spiritual practice that has the potential to heal and connect us to the source of our being

if you wish to venerate gd begin by venerating the earth

i began to believe in myself i began to believe in the process i began to believe in the law of attraction i began to believe that i could truly be healthy again—

you are the eternal sunshine of the cosmic mind

karma is the best bitch around

only a fool believes that natures only purpose is to serve and obey

love cannot be takenaway from the selflessness of an evolved spirit

deep down below

the crystal of our soul

the center that gives birth

this planet we call earth

i have always been fascinated by youth

this fire that makes us feel glorious insolent immortal

i will have to come to terms with it  everything has been reduced to ashes

i tried in vain not to burn myself in the way

i believe that the deep tenderness i feel for man comes from the fact that he is so full of certainty – yet he doubts all the time it is a funny paradox he is constantly misled

he gives great importance to things that do not have any and misses those which have

i would like to be like a flower going through life just like this regardless of whether i will be born again or if anyone will remember my beauty

just passing by like this to make the world a little more beautiful or a little more breathable for a little while

i would like to be a flower of those in the bouquets for the hospitals of those who are plucked to die near those who are going to die

or those who are just born

so that we can watch life together for a moment as long as it is there

to die because i am beautiful and i represent life

to die because the love of the flower never offers itself as a trophy for the love of the flower is always humble

and i love to love with humility

we should always love with humility

that what cannot be expressed in words but is felt with the heart holds all in its warm embrace this is our true nature as it unites us all it is love

earths love song is the universal mother tongue

light up dream on and sing your song

they may say youre a dreamer but you are not the only one

you are a realist living in the true dream of your naturally loving nature

as all life on earth is ultimately lived in the beautiful dream of love

loving is thy nature that giveth birth to all

blessed be all creatures no matter big or small

smile as it is the rainbow of your soul so smile my love please smile you are the magnificent rainbow of my unconditional soul

dost thou not desire what is in thy nature as tis worth more than thine own weight in gold behold then this truth above all to thy owneth loving nature we calleth as ones owneth natures true for all

thank you i love you

more so

so it continues

forever more

i was young i said to myself i have life in front of me

as i got older i said to myself i have life behind me

sick i said to myself i do not care as long as i have life with me

since then life is always with me

neither in front nor behind nor before nor after

i stopped offering it on the altar of time i brought life back to life

when in doubt have no fear

trust in love its always near

all is good as meant to be

trust in love so all can see

karma is the best bitch around

the tenacious delicacy of genius is often found in the most obscure corners of the world

thomas kannon the lady and the samurai

a lazy summers day and a long lost love can a poet ask for anything better than a broken heart ordained from above

the poet unknown orange room poems

love is the reason so we must listen to love before we reason

on the origin and purpose of life

all are special

now it is discovered

angels are among us

that what it means love is you my love

you my love you are the true meaning

the meaning of true unconditional love

practicing a thousand yoga postures doesnt make a person spiritual nor does uttering aum or hallelujah a thousand times  what makes a person spiritual is plain ordinary everyday act of kindness

you dont need to compete with the rest you dont need constant validation from others you just need to excel in your own field you just need to bloom the flower that you are

we must not confine ourselves to reciting the words in prayer with our lips it is necessary that we should raise to god our mind by attention our heart by devotion and our will by submission

spirituality is to remain calm confident balanced and cheerful in the midst of all storms

life is a gift it is to be shared it should be experienced wisely and above all it should be observed consciously

i have fallen in love with the cosmos and all the possibilities it does hold

you are cocreating the song of life in the universe

for the weeping warriors for the savage saints

for the bleeding mothers with fire in their eyes

for the hidden mystics whose prayers keep the earth spinning

for the buddhas wholl use their teeth when their blades are broken

and let their evolutionary ancestors howl through them

this one is for you my lovelies

they have killed off that part of themselves which feels

which cannot look away which brings them trembling to their knees

at the wetfaced beauty of each instant

they deftly slip the punches that life throws at their head as it screams

look at me feel me why did you even come here

is that what depression is aboutthe sinking feeling that your connection to god is broken and you are left to float on your own in a liquid black space like an astronaut who has been cut loose from his spaceship and all that linked him to earth

before words came into meaning there was ones loving feeling it whispered gently love a thousand stars above a luminous sea below it set our hearts aglow  titled one luminous sea of love

to make my sky less blue

love is the ultimate revelation of wisdom

god is one paths are many

a true friendship is determined by how well our friends stand by and support us in our toughest and most distressful times and conversely how well we support them in their difficult situations

you know it too this very hour of the morning when life is barely hatched

the sun melting under the snow

the bud breathing under the frost

the numbed wing of the bird

the morning has its truths that whisper only in a low voice very low we have to be silent

god walks barefoot in the gardens

for you i have renounced

golds and diamonds

name and fame

me and mine

o my love

will you come

will you come

for you i am waiting

burning incenses and lighting candles

singing songs and chanting names

washing floors and painting walls

o my love

will you come

will you come

for you i am praying

with hope and faith

with trust and belief

with love and affection

o my love

will you come

will you come

for you i am living

in surrender and devotion

in dedication and commitment

in renunciation and refuge

o my love

will you come

will you come

the longer you desire something the further the desire predicates upon your ability to obtain that thing than it does the thing itself

once you begin to conquer your fear of failure things that once registered as risks dont anymore

we have a choice either to be a sweeper or a seeker the sweeper just sweeps the material possessions off the earth but the seeker seeks god

nature is harmonious when perceived as a whole which it is

love verily so is the primordial intent through which one desires to create to give birth to and to illuminate all matters of our universe our world our lives so love please love love with all your heart

love first and foremost love first as it drives the universe while we are its foremost passengers

love guides the way love lights the way love is the way

be as you are that what it means love

the essence of life is coalescence as love is essentially all

the messenger is not important the message is love is the message it really is love

hatred is opposite to god opposite to spirituality any form of hatred in the name of country color religion prophet or cult are the darkest ignorance of human consciousness

grace fills empty spaces but it can only enter where there is a void to receive it and it is grace itself which makes this void

there is oneness within all things that is divine in essence

this is a quote from my upcoming third book it contains ideas insight quotes and poems about love and consciously living

suffering happens when we believe the solution is outside ourselves

energy is manifesting universally and this is ongoing the now of this moment is everlasting and so are we awareness is the key that can set you free

are you often confused anxious or frightened the reason is because you are much more than what the mind wants you to think or believe

you are capable of so much beauty and this extends out into the universe

you are capable of so much beauty and this extends out into the universe

it may be beneficial for mind and conscious development to be in this world but remember we are not of this world this is a journey of selfdiscovery that is traveled and experienced by going inward to the source of consciousness

your thoughts your ideas your inner being is directly influenced by people you spend time with the group you are part of and the talks you share with them

therefore choose your company very carefully

the difference between wisdom and spirituality is that wisdom does not have spirituality while spirituality has that

taylor rob the irreducible primary a dialogue on nature spirituality and the human condition

every moment of life is by true definition the first and the last of our human existence how do you wish to live this one moment in life

life is a story book

each time you wake up you open a new page

there are exciting nutritious exhausting pages and there are also pages to remember

almighty god alone is the revealer of the pages

because he is the rightful owner of your life

the purpose and purpose of all of us depend on him in everything

so everyone should ask him to open good pages and close bad pages

time will not enrich your life experience because it is happening now presence is beyond time and space life can only be lived now

there is oneness within all things that is divine in essence

this is a quote from my upcoming third book it contains ideas insight quotes and poems about love and consciously living

the paramount reason for unhappiness and fear is due to our relationship with the content of our existence and more so our lack of awareness to life

there is oneness within all things that is divine in essence

this is a quote from my upcoming third book it contains ideas insight quotes and poems about love and consciously living

there is oneness within all things that is divine in essence

spirituality is not the tales of different religious narratives but rather a state of consciousness that realizes itself in a deeper more authentic integrated nondual nature with reality

steam inhalation is a lovely way to take in the goodness offered by some herbs

consciousness flows where life grows love is the seed that lets it blossom

our true essence originates in the manifestation of life ‘i am who i am’ ongoing it is essential that we awaken to the potential within this statement we determine the content of our existence through active awareness

we are blessed with the gift of life now is the time to actively become aware of this precious endowment

an artist’s prayer

we are gathered together in your name

that we may be of greater service to you

and to our fellows

we offer ourselves to you as instruments

we open ourselves to your creativity in our lives

we surrender to you our old ideas

we welcome your new and more expansive ideas

we trust that you will lead us

we trust that it is safe to follow you

we know you created us and that creativity

is your nature and our own

we ask you to unfold our lives

according to your plan not our low selfworth

help us to believe that it is not too late

and that we are not too small or too flawed

to be healed—

by you and through each other—and made whole

to nurture each other’s unfolding

to encourage each other’s growth

and understand each other’s fears

help us to know that we are not alone

that we are loved and lovable

help us to create as an act of worship to you

understanding the world of energy is called spirituality

being holistic doesnt mean mumbling mystical mumbojumbo all the time it means seeing the reality as it is without giving in to either supernatural nonsense or intellectual arrogance

the human mind has manipulated our species existence we no longer know how to do the one thing that should be the most natural and simplest

we have forgotten how to just be

we seek eternity through science religion and philosophy forever cannot truly be defined it is now knowing this deeply is to know infinity

we are cocreating either a heaven or a hell in each moment this is determined by the object energy released our level of conscious awareness and our interaction with what we have created

one significant realization is to acknowledge that we exist in love we are engulfed in life

something stirred within her as she felt the truth in anna’s words but just to be sure she understood correctly asked the akashic record is a library

finding light in the darkness can mean the difference between monotonous good and a glimpse of greatness

life does not dictate concept definition or purpose neither individually nor universally

being in sync with life allows you to experience human activities naturally as each unfolds and not how the mind construes the experiences

when i am having a bad day or a difficult moment in my minds eye i often return to the soothing images of the sea i recall the roar of the surf as it explodes over ancient volcanic rock formations that decorate the majestic oregon coastline

gorgeous waves roll in endlessly and disperse impressively over the the sandalcovered beach front i invite you to go to your secret place and allow your spirit to dance with the magical visions of inspiration you perceive

your actions bind you because you think that you are the actions

actions bind you because you think that you are the doer the i the ego behind the actions goes on binding you to those actions

through countless past lives this feeling of being the doer has become strengthened

you think that you are a great doer while in reality there is no other doer than existence

how can you drop this attachments and karma

if someone becomes conscious that he is not the doer of the actions  all actions are the will of the whole and he is only a flute in existence hands

in that moment he is free of karma

if the bondage of karma is not destroyed there is no freedom

a meditator says now i am not doing anything everything is done by existence

if someone receives this insight both the bondage of present karma and the bondage of all past karma will vanish

karma can be dissolved only when cut from the root  and the root is the ego the sense of that i am doing

so the doer the i has to dissolve

it is not necessary to focus on the actions only the i the ego has to be dissolved

whenever there is a feeling that i am doing this remember that your are only the seer the witness

be a watcher whenever the feeling of i is there shift it to the watcher

you can make beautiful things with your knowledge and wisdom anywhere everywhere your knowledge your wisdom is nothing in front of just one shock of the earthquake it is nature spirit above all knowledge showing divine power and spirituality

we live in a real life comic book  good vs evil the enemy who we focus on makes a difference in our daily actions and words

the enemys agenda is to build a vicious cycle of confused people who infect society with its evil ways ultimately destroying lives

we only have  choices in life and what we choose matters here now and in the next life

the holy bible is the sustainable solution to all problems

everyone deserves to live out their best life the practical and most cost effective way to accomplish anything in life is to focus and study the name of jesus

if we do not know our biblical history we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes generation after generation

among all the virtues nonviolence is the supreme

live and walk as if you were reaching the highest version of yourself like hands and breath stretched to the sun

being able to be aware that we have thoughts but that we are not our thoughts is a major breakthrough for people seeking emotional health and spiritual wellbeing

if you are willing to experience the gift of life instead of fighting with it you will be moved to the depth of your being

set your eyes on the highest state you can imagine and don’t take them off

you are completely free to reject everything we have to say about spirituality what we believe in is not that important what really counts is what you believe that gives your life meaning direction and purpose

if you spend your time hoping that it doesn’t rain tomorrow you are wasting your time your thoughts don’t change the rain

if you want to have true religion in your heart then burn the scriptures and go out in the world to end misery

to recognise ourselves in each other

is to build the bridge towards compassion and love

love doesnt happen in a flash love doesnt happen by chance true love is an eternal ecstasy that makes your heart and soul dance

they look for him in temples rituals or forests who cannot find him in their hearts

the solution to everything begins with loving our self

choose the positive because its all good be honest be open stop and think see the red flags let go of ego now make a healthy choice

you are who god says you are

our spirit whispers are the best guides and they are found in the very personal quiet moments when we are doing nothing

it doesnt matter how long the dance lasts

as long as the encounter ignites the passion of life in us once again

and the trail of its beauty remains etched upon our heart forever

there is a far greater purpose for us and the world more than we can see or some would like us to see

we must carry on and trust infinitely the power of the soul

what it means to live life is to experience the moment that is passing through you and then experience the next moment and then the next

the heart is the place through which energy flows to sustain you

when you believe beautiful things will happen if you have the faith of a bird seed or believe in parrots who talk

anybody who has told you that you need another being to supplement your experience of love has misguided you to live meaningfully is to celebrate love everyday

it is spiritually beneficial to understand that if we can first accept what is happening at any moment we will experience more harmony within ourselves as a human being

contemplative prayer removes us from the drivers seat

you are not your heart you are the experiencer of your heart

if there is anything that makes the ministry look grim and dull it i the dark insidious anger in the servants of christ

q no purposeful action is then possible

m all i say is that consciousness contains all in consciousness all is possible you can have causes if you want them in your world another may be content with a single cause — god’s will the root cause is one the sense ‘i am’

eventually we must give up trying to be something special

i care not about science i care not about spirituality all i care about is service of humanity

the sacred power of divine spirit transcends space and time

spirituality is not decorating the ego with philosophies dogmas and rituals but finding out the eternal center of love in the heart which no storm can disturb

selfdeception is a constant problem as we progress along a spiritual path ego is always trying to achieve spirituality it is rather like wanting to witness your own funeral

a better world begins with a better human

the seeds of care and empathy are built into every human being and a variety of soils and fertilizers will allow those same seeds to grow and flourish

i prayed but the words fell to the ground meaning nothing

i could compare my music to white light which contains all colors only a prism can divide the colors and make them appear this prism could be the spirit of the listener

if you wish to love then simply love and if you wish to truly live then simply live it is easy to experience true love and share this with someone presence is the key to love and to life

it doesn’t matter to god what we call ourselves or even what we call him we’re the only ones who care about that

it may be beneficial for mind and conscious development to be in this world but remember we are not of this world this is a journey of selfdiscovery that is traveled and experienced by going inward to the source of consciousness

the birth of a person is not truly a beginning it is a continuation of life a conscious reawakening reawakening continues throughout your existence it unfolds within the beautiful heightened awareness of life

an enormous privilege usually takes a huge responsibility

life is universally intertwined not individually dominated we are in essence absolute consciousnesseverything is one with life

any lifeform that evolves beyond a given mental and conscious level can achieve a deeper synchronicity with lovelife and ultimately universal consciousness however this can only occur when the given lifeform is aware and willing

man is god and god is man the condition of the earth is our divine punishment

losing weight and regaining health does not mean eating smaller portions of the same unhealthy food the plan a diet is the optimal diet to choose for the rest of your life research confirms that gods plan a diet should become yours as well

your spiritual alliance with your soul is the conduit to lead a successful life on earth

you cannot ensure continual success by looking outside of yourself you will never find lasting satisfaction there things change fads come and go but the approach that breeds success can plant and grow within you

there are spiritual guardians at all the transitional places in our mysterious multidimensional universes the precious sacred souls of animals are created to beautifully traverse these regions when their bodies are no more upon the earth

though free to think and act we are held together like the stars in the firmament with ties inseparable these ties cannot be seen but we can feel them

nisargadatta you can have for the asking all the peace you want

questioner i am asking

nisargadatta you must ask with an undivided heart and live an integrated life

questioner how

nisargadatta detach yourself from all that makes your mind restless renounce all that disturbs its peace if you want peace deserve it

nisargadatta those only deserve it who dont disturb it

questioner in what way do i disturb peace

nisargadatta by being a slave to your desires and fears

questioner even when they are justified

nisargadatta emotional reactions born of ignorance or inadvertence are never justified

seek a clear mind and a clean heart all you need is to keep quietly alert inquiring into the real nature of yourself this is the only way to peace

on the path of selfrealization there is no one big awakening but many along the way of varying degrees some small some big and each one

of them is like the lotus flower which grows out of muddy

questioner we were told about karma and reincarnation evolution and yoga masters and disciples what are we to do with all this knowledge

maharaj leave it all behind you forget it go forth unburdened with ideas and beliefs abandon all verbal structures all relative truth all tangible objectives the absolute can be reached by absolute devotion only dont be halfhearted

q i must begin with some absolute truth is there any

m yes there is the feeling i am begin with that

evolution is the lifeforce of metaphysics and spirituality

in all that we lose we rediscover a hidden part of ourselves loss is a road toward self discovery because it is only when we are stripped back to nothing that we realise how truly valuable we are

india teaches me again and again that the categories into which i try to divide things dont hold up

consciousness doesnt emerge from matter because it has always been in matter consciousness is a fundamental quality that exists everywhere and in everything

knowledge is like an everflowing stream of water and where you stop to drink from it is where you will become quenched

i have no nationality except humanity

i have no tradition except compassion

i have no religion except liberty

i have no god except a family of  billion

i have no belief but only awareness

i have no creed but only acceptance

i have no messiah except the self

i have no scripture except my conscience

i have no gospel except godliness

i have no sermon except thought

i have no philosophy except oneness

i have nothing to give you except love a whole lot

i demand no obedience nor do i desire worship and offering

for there is death in worship and freedom is lifes mainspring

i am myself

i do as i know

i know what is true

i live as my authentic self

mindfulness keeps you on top of your thinking mind in such a way that you become

the gatekeeper of your thoughts

each moment is an opportunity to allow for the spiritual

to shine through our human experience by doing so we

can then open ourselves up to the possibility of feeling an

we can begin by practicing mindfulness every moment of each day and it will help us stay awake and aware when we even begin to step out of the moment of caring about

i’m so glad you’re here

i’m ready for you

i am authentic

i live in harmony with who i am

i am true to my nature

you can either continue on the path of your destiny as

you have been living it up to now or you can completely

change the course of it by deciding that you want it to be

different starting now

the only way for today to be unlike any other day is for

you to take hold of it by the reins and guide it to where you

want it to go

there are people who live half in the present and half

in the future and what ends up happening is that they’re

split in their commitment to the present

the future is something to look forward to not a place

to escape to and even if you like to dream or fantasize about

what lies ahead for you do it mindfully

when wisdom overtakes our ignorance then we realize the truth of who we are and why we are here

we all want pleasure we dont want pain we love sunshine and pray that it doesnt rain but if we dont realize who we are and why we are here our life will go in vain

karma is just a universal law that keeps the world going the creator of the cosmos has created this karmic law so that there is continuity on planet earth

perfect is overrated to be wholesomely herself she needs to be honest with herself for that is where her unedited self resides  her untapped potential

i decided to relax because as usual absolutely nothing was under control

i suddenly imagined the buddha staring at his naval laughing the truth is so simple so free

you will know what you are supposed to do with your

life if you always make love your guide

the metal element has to do with our spirituality it is the place we choose to find our connection with all of life when we tend to the precious metal within us it comes forward as inner strength that shines bright for all to witness

above me sister moon and her union of stars

real mindfulness is to be aware of a situation both internally and externally and so to see as a wholethat this is not separate from that

to try and maybe be wrong without consequences to anyone but herself this was one of the treasures she wanted from her retreat its was the kind of possibility that would usually get lost in the forest of her responsibilities

so scenic scenery seamless

seems as if im dreaming this sequence

sun seeping between the leaves

reflecting off the stream

so serene setting stunning

sound of the wind

natures music

my favorite playlist

to those who stand naked in the holy wilderness of life embracing all shadows of self i bow to you

the soul of the universe awaits to enfold you in pure white light

call it god if you wish thats fine when you consider that in the hebrew sense god means the indefinable that which cannot be know or understood the universal consciousness is not easy to understand and yet we can know it

now is the most real moment there is i live in the moment of now

the truth is that all of the moments of our lives are magical because we are alive in them

a magical moment reminds us of how magical life can

be but it doesn’t mean its job is to entertain us or inebriate

us or exalt us or make us feel special all of the time that’s

putting the burden onto something outside of ourselves

find your stillness find your acceptance find your

gratitude and most of all find you in the magic you’re

there you’re the magic moment now let it happen and it

will believe in yourself

you are the director of your life movie and can change

alter enhance and even erase an image impression scene

or scenario that serves no positive purpose for you to hold

onto our memories create pictures in our minds and we can

change them rearrange them or delete them as we wish

first simeon takes the child jesus into his arms and praises god saying at last allpowerful master you give leave to your servant to go in peace according to your promise lk

this present moment is the moment that matters the most because you are in it and as i said if you value being alive then you value the moment you are most alive in which is right now

when we’re present our senses are heightened and we can enjoy so much more of what we’re seeing hearing tasting smelling and feeling

god is glorious he is indestructible truth eternal beauty

man is so busy discovering everything outside that he has lost connection with what is inside

bliss is the nature of spiritforce in the same way that wetness is a quality of water

so as evolution progresses consciousness becomes more involved in matter living beings become a fuller expression of spirit and move closer to the source from which they and all things came

there is no shortcut to success

but what good are scars if they do not ache

and what good are eyes if they do not weep

what good is desire if it does not hurt

what good is a passion if it stays ‘sleep

unless you open the wings of your heart unless you forgive all you cannot move you cannot fly in the land of light

souls up here will decide whether they want to incarnate into a human earthly life or whether they want to experience an existence on another galaxy or star system somewhere else

phobias result from past life experiences

many people have phobias about snakes about heights or enclosed spaces and all of these absolutely come from pastlife experiences which are not necessarily bad experiences

spirit guides may be souls who you had shared past lives with and with whom you had had good experiences they may also be angels archangels ascended masters or other senior beings whose role through all eternity is to be a spirit guide

birthmarks and freckles or other skin marks come from past life injuries

the soul permeates every cell every atom and the space within and between the atoms between the electrons and the other components all through from your toenails to the tips of your hair

every soul comes into a new life with a plan and goals and then to experience events which will allow it to meet these objectives

a soul is eternal it never dies or ends

when you get goose bumps all over or an involuntary shiver down the spine or you feel like somebody has walked over your grave then this is a past life connection

the problem of sex which is now so important so vast in our lives loses its meaning when there is the tenderness the warmth the kindliness the mercy of love

if there is anything a book a piece of fabric a flower whatever that generates that instant wow gutsinking feeling that is an acid test that it’s extremely likely to have come from a pastlife experience

take care of your words and see how they’ll take care of you

death is a stripping away of all that is not you the secret of life is to die before you die and find that there is no death

you could even be in heaven and make it like a god damn hell in your mind it’s your choice to choose your world

what you are basically deep deep down far far inn is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself

allow the full moon to shower you with feminine luster you are the goddess incarnate you are spirit in body

science finally agrees with spirituality that we human beings are in essence energy and not matter that we appear to be

any soul wanting an earthly incarnation can only choose a human simply because animals don’t have souls

instead of realizing that god gives us birth we ignorantly celebrate the birth of god we must learn to surrender to the power that is beyond our comprehension

virtually no soul ever achieves all of its objectives in one lifetime

are our lives like carworn ruts

in the face of the ground

created through habitual use

and so set in place that they dictate

an unalterable course of drudgery

complaints and same ol same ol

which if bucked threatens our security

that is one long sentence isnt it

you can change it

take this idea that you have that you must be attached to things and apply to it the reality that you came here with nothing and when you leave this great earth youll be leaving with nothing

unless the pilot takes off and flies the plane you will be where you are we all need something beyond prayer to reach god we need a pilot a mentor a master or a guru who can help us realize the truth

there should be a limit to my suffering

as i’m a sinner not a disbeliever

before enlightenment cornflakes and coffee after enlightenment cornflakes and coffee

what is our ultimate goal of life is it to be happy and to escape from strife no it is wrong to think happiness is the goal our purpose is to be liberated realizing we are the soul

the only way we can change our lives is to change our energy — to change the electromagnetic field we are constantly broadcasting in other words to change our state of being we have to change how we think and how we feel

happiness is never your own it is where the ‘i’ is not it is beyond your reach you have only to reach out beyond yourself and you will find it

what is religion a cloud in the sky i live in the sky not in the clouds which are so many words held together remove the verbiage and what remains truth remains

to understand death is to understand something which is closely related to life

if you have faith in all the trinities and apostles in the world and still have no faith in yourself there is no salvation for you

the best path is to have no path

whenever i find myself losing faith in humanity i come back to the classical music they are a great reminder that we are also able to produce beautiful things made out of strong and barely controllable emotions

karma is nothing but the law of action whatever is our action so will be the reaction if we plant a tomato we shouldn’t expect a mango what we reap is what we sow

through art i keep me all to myself

just as jesus performed what in his culture was the work of a slave so we in our cultures must regard no task too menial or degrading to undertake

good or bad whatever we dois recorded by karma that is true for we see what goes around comes around our karma decides what happens on the ground

the law of karma has accounts three  an opening balance like root of a tree a current account of all that we do and a karmic corpus that never loses sight of you

only if we share christs death on earth will we share his life in heaven

karma and rebirth have a connection we must know our actions will be redeemed even after the end of the show our karmas vanish when our bodies dies we will be reborn as the body who cries

spirituality is a magnet and magnet determines the iron not the wood or stone similarly faith and devotion are an iron that affects only a believer not an unbeliever

karma is a cosmic law that makes everything go who is it that is managing the show it is the one who made the earth it is the one who causes our death and our birth

if only people realized that their god was no different from the god of other religions it would foster peace acceptance and love in the world

we are searching for life in the stars but we havent studied the flowers while life is in you and me right here we are looking for it in mars

the eye you see is not an eye because you see it

it is an eye because it sees you

your physical position does not determine your spiritual condition through faith our spiritual position determines our physical condition

if happiness was just achievement then the rich and wealthy would be glad but look around and you will find that many of them are sad

whatever be the method we use what we truly are we must not confuse not the ego the body nor the mind we are the divine energy this truth we must find

science without religion is lame spirituality withou materialism is a shame

science without religion is lame spirituality without materialism is a shame

once we realize that everything is a show nothing is real we come and we go then we do not feel misery and pain for we just watch the drama without loss or gain

what i see is not me i am the one who sees the body and mind may suffer but that is not me

much of our effort to do things for the lord is really the resurgence of our desire to dominate and make things happen in our own strength

to be a full lover is to become a healer to yourself and then help another heal their self

good is god and discrimination is demon

everything is here and everything is now within you

in god’s providence we have four gospels for jesus christ is too great and glorious a person to be captured by one author or one perspective

souls are won for christ by tears and sweat and pain especially in prayer and in sacrificial personal friendship

being a christian is not about being christfearing its about being christlike

i want to be stretched shook up to overreach myself and to make you feel that way too

i remember it taking place they were dangerous back then we were shut up stopped in every way detained by their power they could just say one word and we had to leave it was a horrible time for our kind

what happened i ask my strength slowly returning

well when their leader left years went by and a new normal set in it became easier to get a hold on people we came out of hiding this this right here is a great time for us there are so many avenues and outlets for us to use

merging consciously in sexual union is one of the most important moments in time it is a contract of two souls an expression of divine commitment to each other if we stop dividing sexuality and spirituality we can understand its sacredness

it’s key to know if you’re currently having sex based on an ego connection or transcending your sex life into love

we must unite the energies within to have a wholistic relationship with ourselves which gives us the capability to have a complete relationship with others

unfortunately human progress is generally determined not by our spiritual our emotional and our intellectual development but by that of our technologies

god has prepared a path for each of us to go through

you just have to be able to read the signs he has left

once properly aligned with your mate everything will happen naturally if you are alive and breathing you are very capable of experiencing cosmic connectivity with explosive intimacy

december  power of free will and wisdom understand how can you use your creativity to empower yourself and make wiser choices

the universe is a puzzle

life is a problem to be solved

its not what it appears to be

there are doors

there are locks and keys

there are levels

if you get it right somehow it will give way to something extremely unexpected

december rd power of adventure and exploring which beautiful adventures do you enjoy that help you to restore balance

we are prisoners of this body we are prisoners of this mind but in reality who are we on realization we will find

as long as we believe the myth we can never realize the truth

step up your spiritual game  embrace your identity as a son or daughter of god

alas man has discovered everything but he has not discovered the god that is within

when energy escapes at death it merges with the universal cosmic energy

you and i may appear as two different human beings what we don’t realize is we are only manifestations of god

truth be told truth must not be sold

life is interconnected and each dimension overlaps the other in a holographic and interwoven way nothing exists in isolation everything interpenetrates everything else

our hearts are channels from which we experience and are connected to the divine flow of creation it’s the channel in which we transcend our emotions and come to know love in this space we exist without constructs

the world is a beautiful place

to exist within as a visitor

it is a joyous experience

but when you get tied up in it and locked in

it can become

it is important to realise that you do not

really own anything here

you borrow it from the earth mother

you are grateful for it

always remember you are a visitor

for this is the cause why we be not all in ease of heart and soul that we seek here rest in those things that are so little wherein is no rest and know not our god that is allmighty allwise allgood for he is the very rest

all living things dance with joy

when they realise that in every atom

of time and space

is the spark of eternal life

everyone is an aspect of light

and are potentially the blazing glory

of the whole of light

be aware of your inner eternality

be aware that you are not a speck of dust

on the face of the universe

you are a cell in a mighty blood stream

know that you are a living vital part

of the essence of creative life

growth is about moving forward while chaos often sends you repeatedly through the same cycles

a belief is your brain’s selfmaintenance mechanism

guilt was a thorny carpet

laid on the ground i walked on

repent and redeem

no vile soul feels a disesteem

whispers filling my head

too loud to ignore

pills upon pills i swallowed them all

for a brief stolen moment

i dove into an ocean of a blissfully quiet oblivion

a shadow of what was once i

god i am grateful today for all things that cash cant pay what would life be without eyes to see wonder without music how happy could i be thank you lord  are words i say every moment on this grateful day

my ego is my identity my ego is not ‘me’ because i live in ignorance who i am i cannot see

i love both the dark and the light evil and angel good as well as bad because they all are incomplete without each other

believe me if youve been shut up for a year and a half it can get to be too much for you sometimes but feelings cant be ignored no matter how unjust or ungrateful they seem

the eyes see the world the mind sees the eyes but ‘i’ am the one who watches them both‘i’ am the one behind

death is a doorway to god we celebrate life and mourn death shouldnt we reverse it

god is not someone you can see with your eyes god is not on the earth or in the skies those who realize god are conscious of god in everything they see they can feel the lord

you can just choose to live and die or start a quest to find who is i

a question not asked remains unanswered

god is easy to please but hard to satisfy

if you don’t understand what you are saying and to who you are praying how will you realize god

what is the energy that gives us breath what life energy leaves us that causes our death we are that energy we are the soul to realize this truth is our life goal

is god in a temple is god in a church is god in a mosque continue your search when you get to the rootyou will realize the truth

within this urn of stillness

i slumber in deep sleep

to warm my gentle ashes

igniting the flame within my soul

once again i fly to the heavens

release sap and seeds

into hearts and minds

so arthur’s dream

can reveal echoes

so camelot’s glory

in the rich forests

and mountains’ mysterious valleys

where a once and future king

lowered his sword

and lay in the arms

of his sweet lady of forests and lakes

sands of time released my ancient image

to awaken you to the artistry and splendour

of egypt’s camelot

no mystery am i

a modern woman trapped in an old time

go forward beautiful ladies and create

new worlds of artistry and beauty

out of the sands of time

you live in my womb

learn from my seasons

and grow old in my arms

listen to my heart

i give you garments

i bless your arrival

then let you fly free

knowing forever we are one

you and i

i journey the never ending path

only to return again

to kiss the warm lips of mother earth

beneath the gentle gaze

holding the dreaming wish

of safety in our arms

may your stone flesh

awaken with my garland

so once again

your love fills

my heart with peace

you speaketh

an infinite message

i awake with thee

then sleep in thouest golden glow

the god source of life

is a huge energy that has no personality

as you would know it in human terms

it expresses personality through all things

your own existence is expressing

the personality of god

as are the rolling waves the stars and the trees

it is a mighty force in the universe

which is bringing creation to wholeness

a perfection to life

upon the never ending journey

of each new era

forgotten and buried

then revealed again

you gaze upon me now

my worn body still breathes cosmic light

peace and strength am i

listen and gaze

peace is my song

understand that the cosmos

is not an alien wave of planets

that have no personal connection with you

look at the stars

feel them vibrating through your whole body

they are your friends

and are part of your greater self

the sky you are looking at is very alive

the stars are not just shining at you

they are beckoning unto you

to be one with them

they are beaming their message

for humanity to join

the universal balance

i want to write about the sky

and keeps the cosmic ring in wonder

my dry heart soaks in a dance of raindrops

absorbs the water and inhales the smell

i am back from heaven and content

i live i love i laugh…again

excerpted from healed by rain chapter resilience

my soul sings loudly forever changed by love

but releasing every storm from within

feeling exhausted but safe and blessed

excerpted from healed by rain chapter resilience

my cosmic desires freeze in an apocalyptical healing

alleviate my nightmares and calm my deep thunders

excerpted from healed by rain chapter resilience

drops of rain fall on my naked skin

they clean my spirit and awake my conscience

they cry with me in a cathartic release

they scream they fight they hurt they heal

excerpted from healed by rain chapter resilience

i’ll pray to god to give me strength and patience

i’ll feel no pain no vengeance no regrets

and i will learn to love again…myself this time

excerpted from my kind of resilience chapter resilience

i’ll celebrate the waltz of stars in endless harmony

i’ll dream with my angels in far away lands

and i will send love letters to my future self

excerpted from my kind of resilience chapter resilience

i’ll feel the magic in the blissful daylight

i’ll listen to the cheerful songs of nature

and i will heal my soul with joy and love

excerpted from my kind of resilience chapter resilience

i’ll take the sadness in my eyes and bury it into depths

i’ll withstand with courage every shadow of my harmful past

and i will never lose again just learn and win

excerpted from my kind of resilience chapter resilience

i chose to

explore the senses of this delightful universe

breathe the sensations of my body with every move

abandon myself in flow and feel compassion

become aware of my existence

and thank lord for his blessings on me…

excerpted from mindfulness chapter resilience

i chose to

float in contentment and forgive all the deep pains

accept the shadows of my queer past

encounter faith and that magic love from within

enrich my spirit with graceful emotions of who i am

listen to the essence of life and collect its charm

cultivate the fascinating practice of spiritual wellbeing

excerpted from mindfulness chapter resilience

i chose to

live and make this living worth it

pray with angels and receive their blessing

enjoy the beauty of this mesmerizing world

feel the bliss with every passing morning

hear the calling of my inner beauty

sway in tears of joy and embrace the flight

excerpted from mindfulness

a radical transition to loving yourself often requires physical separation it requires physical separation because you must relearn love beyond the physical body

we cannot long survive spiritually separated in a world that is geographically together

god art thou and thy will be done

your personal development doesn’t end when the relationship begins everything in life requires consistent care to maintain a working relationship involves accountability

the idea of heartbreak comes from trying to reconcile what we wanted and thought would happen with the reality of what actually happened

loving yourself is being honest with yourself and then giving yourself the space to heal and transform

your life changes one thought at a time and it’s the thought that we are separate from source from love that prevents us from being whole

it is common for many individuals to enter into a relationship and get so consumed with trying to figure it out that they lose touch with their primary relationship the relationship they have with their self

ultimately codependency ends when you make the choice to stop relating in codependent ways and by developing a healthy harmonious relationship with yourself

since the only constant is change as you grow there is always room to develop and improve the personal relationship you have with yourself

instead it is more advantageous to consciously come to an awareness of what you perceived as love and understand the deeper lesson which is attached to your growth the growth that is ultimately meant to bring you to a place of wholeness

things aren’t brought to light because of the illusion of fear and we don’t want to shatter the illusion because we can go on living within multiple realities where we can unfairly hold someone to an expectation they are unaware of

things aren’t brought to light because of the illusion of fear and we don’t want to shatter the illusion because we can go on living within multiple realities where we can unfairly hold someone to an

expectation they are unaware of

the reason that you cannot feel any progress in yourself is that you cannot feel spiritual there is no such thing as a person’s feeling spiritual that is as impossible as feeling that you are honest or feeling that you are moral

the reason that you cannot feel any spiritual progress in yourself is that you cannot feel spiritual there is no such thing as a person’s feeling spiritual that is as impossible as feeling that you are honest or feeling that you are moral

become peace until peace becomes your only reality

the ego wants to rule but the heart will quietly prevail

thaddeus noticed the archangels had their own personal rooms with name tags showing which office belongs to whom gabriel michael charles lucifer

yea it’s empty been empty for years

why didn’t doesn’t god use it for something else thaddeus had to know

i don’t know maybe he wanted to keep it as a reminder or something maybe he’s hoping his old friend will come back home i’m not sure jesus answered with a sad look on his face

acceptance does not mean surrender it does not mean resignation acceptance means i am finally available to the entire spectrum of creative responses

when you spend any time at all paying attention to the proclivities of the natural world you realize that nature has no problem including in its sorority the dead dying and ailing as fully as the lovely healthy and whole

to see a place as orphaned or wounded is also to reexamine the meaning of living and dying and to allow some curiosity and even a sense of marvel to emerge about the tactics things employ to persevere

getting high only made me think of you more

i lay there lay there the places we call home are never remembered on a map and all manic episodes start with a thought

i want to be your lighthouse

no matter how many dreams change

i want to be built upon rock

weathered by storms

smoothed out by the sea

with jagged edges only you know

i have felt your drool on me

and never loved you more

then with your closed eyes

telling my shirt that home was not full of sights

but only full of soul

two insane idiots with the same idea that is what love is

most of the conversation was said with our eyes our eyes told truths neither of us could understand her a goddess and me her pew it was spent with me looking at her and her looking elsewhere perpendicular

the abyss is black and eventually i know i will smile laugh even knowing all i think i know maniacally while i howl at anything i could see that would laugh snarl and howl the way i do

the biggest lie i ever told anyone was that i would not leave

degrading to atoms conscious or not the world was always and never falling apart

the two models of revival are in reality only one the expanding of gods kingdom in a liberating warfare against the forces of darkness in which the most important battleground is the hearts of men

a life lived for others is a true religious life

i surrender to my inner knowing

the pursuit of happiness is one of the most common symptoms of intellectual immaturity

it is not enough to just be in a relationship that is aimlessly moving forward you must be aware of which direction the relationship is moving and be an active participant in the development unfolding and growth of the relationship

knowingness of who they are and entered into the relationship with awareness and commitment to cultivate a union that went beyond meeting surface needs and replaying of karmic patterns

if you were truly existing in a state of love with another person and the relationship somehow came to an end you would understand that no perceived love was lost because love cannot be destroyed or denatured it is a perpetual state

all the joints and drinks in the world could only serve to remind me i imagine myself being gatsby watching the party that i have thrown to get to where i am a future where there is a something where i am better where i am something

she left me ravenous and wishing upon fireflies for more limbs as puzzle pieces we fit together

being in peace doesnt mean absence of misery it means absence of conflict in the mind

global harmony is only the reflection of humankinds internal harmony

the world needs psychological singularity that is oneness among humans not some pompous biotechnological singularity

what you call law is essentially the need of an uncivilized and unfree society a truly civilized and free society needs no law

we are all reflections of each other in the vast mirror of motion and space

when seeing life for what it is becomes more important than seeing it your way you’ll finally understand what courage means

with love we were created for love we may live and to love we may return

here in this very moment there is a joyful clear and peaceful reality in which you can abide

physical adoration has driven many of us away from our unique and true gifts some of us have become so obsessed with a fit body or so ashamed for not having one that unnecessary suffering alongside exercise has grown to be part of our lifestyle

not knowing the truth doesn’t keep you from finding it

till my last damn breath would choose humanity over religion

art is the dance of the soul after one realizes that life is a song

i believe that the heart is the master of our lives the mind our powerful servant and the body the bridge between them

my search for happiness ended so a meaningful life could get started

i am in misery i am in pain but i am not in conflict

i have been confused

i have been hurt

i have been depressed

but never believed these states defined the real me

compassion is a quality in those who are able to understand beyond right and wrong

we can’t define love unless we become it

throw away all mystical nonsense and be divine through your acts of kindness  be divine through your gestures of acceptance  be divine through your footsteps of awareness

if you have realized your responsibility towards your society then you are more enlightened that all the priests imams and pundits combined

an odd person but a good one who believe that being honest about oneselfe and honest in my dealings with others is the only way that i can move beyond games to genuine intimacy and friendship with other people

unfortunately compassion and honesty are difficult to find

a sacred sexual spiritual partnership is essentially what at core if not many all of us are searching for or have searched for at some point in time in ourselves or in another

when we’re outside of alignment we’re outside of love and our perceived experiences of love are not

love at all but rather attachments of the ego we must be willing to surrender the ego to our higher self our higher existence when we refuse this

surrendering we make the choice to go through painful experiences that are heartbreaking and frustrating until we make the choice to surrender and come into alignment with our higher self our wholeness this experience of surrendering and

alignment does not constrict us to a rigid existence but rather expands us into infinite possibilities we are now a reflection of source which is infinite and free flowing

how one can get through the dark night of the soul and pass the test of karmic purification

i know who you are

you are me disguised as you

some people grow

partially so

in all there is still a few

those with a different view

and yet they sow

like the rivers flow

in the rain high or low

the seeds of a soul

no religion is greater than love

for love is the embodiment of divinity

no church is higher than the self

cause the self is the manifestation of the almighty

no worship is greater than help

for helping is the service of god

no prayer is as sacred as kindness

for in kindness lies the real act of the lord

no scripture is more glorious than the mind

for the mind is the creator of the scriptures

so learn from that scripture within to be of help to your kind

and be the glue to the fabric of humanity healing all ruptures

heal your kind my friend with your wisdom and warmth transcendent

if not you then who else will unify humanity and rise as sapiens triumphant

preparing for partnership is a process the male must want to go through sometimes there are life experiences that can trigger the desire to transcend his lower nature into a higher existence

when you enter any relationship with doubt that doubt will be reflected back to you you must trust yourself completely to attract another that can be trusted

avoiding others because they don’t suit my way of life is tragic

people who are spiritually minded tend to suffer from anxiety and depression more you know why because their eyes are open to a world that is in need of repair they literally have an increased ability to feel the emotions of people around them

i guess you need to be an intelligentlooking old man to sell books full of spiritual bullshit

talking reason with a fundamentalist is like talking balanced diet with a hungry tiger  you cant win

the only change you can bring is in you what precedes is a reaction to it

so stop pretending and start working

the only change you can bring is in you what precedes is a reaction to it

so stop pretending and start working

the main problem with nowadays christians is that they want to claim heaven while still clinching to the world at the same time

if you wont respect yours you can never give it to others

yours truly

i am but a human whos got no name

simply alive in the land of liberty

i am but a human who talks no lame

simply communicates with utter serenity

i am but a human who despises harming

no matter what some books command

i am but a human who loves not blaming

no matter how much my peers demand

i am but a human who lives not in history

simply breathes in the now and here

i am but a human whos curious in mystery

and loves to investigate forged with questionnaire

i am but a human teeming with awareness beyond all race and clans

i am but a human whose religion is liberty and god the humans

you were born with the universe you live with the universe and you will dissolve in the universe be proud of your pedigree

this breakage within us is what makes us human and vulnerable there is nothing more sinister than someone whose mind seems to be an absolute circle there is a helpless coldness and a deadly certainty about such a presence

an empty mind is a devils workshop and a spiritual mind is full of promise and can achieve everything in life including happiness peace and contentment

best place to go is

best person to meet is

yourself

and the best thing to seek is

when we have reached the outposts of the mind we are ready for the journey to the heart

any spiritual practice that draws our energy and attention up  without equally focusing downward  is inherently ungrounding and will make us out of balance

karma is what is happening to you

it’s the result of your thinking

be aware you are designing your own life

there is a link between living an unauthentic life and depression

freedom is to know that you are free

only those who are compassionate toward themselves can be compassionate toward others

is there a more a heartpleasing word than contentment i doubt

my reflection on life and death deepened when i removed the and that separates them

the essence of discipleship is union with christ which means identification with him in both his sufferings and his glory

i say work because true union and love goes beyond the individual self and the individuals within the union it is for the benefit of the planet and true development is involved

spirituality is more a feeling an emotion deep within your heart that rises to tell the mind that there is something ethereal in the surroundings

as women we can embody all aspects of the triple goddess simultaneously mother maiden crone at every stage of our lives the elements of feminine mystique giftedness and strength are available to us through the spirit as much as the body

the light is your real self the i am presence the full monadic perfection of all ths is source

the light is your real self the i am presence the full monadic perfection of all that is source

thymus gland really is the seat of rejuvenating power in the body and enables the body to maintain its immortality

some people make cars some rockets  i make gods

ultimately what i realized is i wasn’t looking for an equal partner there was a knowing in place that i was energetically feeling for a partner who was also at a place of internal alignment

having a healthy and harmonious relationship with yourself is genuinely feeling gratitude for your existence and truly accepting yourself in totality

misanthrope fits me so damn well

the male is the giving part of a sexual union and the female is the receptive part since the wombman is the receiver she must be aware of her partner’s spiritual nature before choosing to be intimate with him

the key is being aware of what’s happening in your intimate experiences healthy relationships are where the individuals love themselves first so they can exchange love with

each other fairly if someone in the relationship love is absent the other will be left feeling drained

each time we connect physically with another a merger is happening a merger that goes beyond just a physical connection the first layer of sex is energetic not physical

when you understand sex is energetic you know that the act is a merger of energy bodies it’s a merger of consciousness it connects you both beyond the body

i let go of my need to control circumstances in my life in order to feel safe in this now moment i am connected to source therefore i am safe

if you have the desire to change your life your circumstances your perspectives hold fast to your inner commitments and listen to your inner knowing

it is when you begin to accept yourself in totality that you come into alignment with your wholeness for example when you accept something in totality you are recognizing it within its full potential and full divinity

never give up on you each day you wake up you

choose the reality you’re going to live in based on your thoughts today choose to love yourself fully and embrace all that you are there is no one on the planet exactly like you embrace what sets you apart and find beauty within yourself

i am no religious preacher or a spiritual teacher nor am i an intellectual philosopher or a divine incarnation  i am you in the service of you

the greatest virtue a person can have is not the fortune of material goods but the fortune of intellectual values this is the only way this world can be a better place

the cup does not entice the lips unless the wines colour is seen through the transparent crystal

changing the family given name to a sanskrit based name doesnt make a person either free or holy  by doing so one only exchanges one prison for another

simply awareness will make you see what has been what will be and what could be

it is better to die while living than to live while dying

the best way to understand something in the spiritual world is by studying its counterpart in the physical world

no imaginary monkey is going to come down on earth to say hello or give a hand in your times of need so you must be the hand that gives a hand to yourself when needed

awareness is simply seeing without trying to see the end

outside you actions don’t exist outside you history doesn’t exist outside you future doesn’t exist

to me  the scientist the preacher the entrepreneur the janitor the showgirl the sex worker and all others are one and the same human spirit in which i see the image of my own self

there never was any separate and supernatural trinity  it has always been the human mind playing the triangle

i am a scientist which means i dont have the luxury to talk nonsense if it cant pass the test of reasoning no matter how much it sounds philosophical or spiritual

there is no greater sacred power than the indomitable spirit of humanity

we are not under law as a way of salvation but as a guide to conduct

give of your splendor to everyone

like the sun

heartbreak should be a celebration not mourning because it’s an opportunity to get in touch with what your current beliefs are and an opportunity to step back in alignment with what represents your highest good

each of us must examine our own humanity and explore the contours of our own spirituality to determine what is right and just when we create our own path we follow it to our spiritual renaissance

we are all lit up from within as if graced by a sacred source of sunlight

the truth belongs to the experience

the truth belongs to the experience not the attempt of third parties to interpret a story without knowing the exact incidents but only one or a few facts

and you stop needing to have the experience of

heartbreak when you realize you are already whole if you are already love no one can come into your life and take away the love you’ve cultivated and become

your uniqueness is the highest gift of the existence spirituality is uncovering and blossoming that uniqueness

you are already that which you seek

…the sacred feminine is not new to the new age it is ageless and from the beginning the sacred feminine is in our blood it is our heritage you have permission to say ‘god is woman’ and ‘god is me

can it cure the one spiritual disease asked father brown with a serious curiosity

and what is the one spiritual disease asked flambeau smiling

oh thinking one is quite well said his friend

the real quest begins when this notknowing ceases to be an agnostic concept and becomes a living experience

the earth on which we live is the body of god all people and living things are the body and soul of god andwe serve god not by making the earth and its people suffer but by making the earth and its people whole

seek the divine from the devotions

if you bow only to the infinite that is within you

you will stand in front of the entire world

we are nobody

nobody

in this dream i was a songwriter and an artist

i fell madly in love with you

do you remember how hard it was

what we went through to find one another

i am always so reluctant to do this over and over again

there is always that fear that i wont find you

though i always trust the process

still there are powerful illusions in this world

but none could keep me from you

at times i feel like i dug through stone with my bare hands to find you

other times i laugh at how perfect it all is and at the worry

that i may never lay eyes on you again

how foolish

you can’t separate water from rain

science is knowing that what is has always been science aint discovering anything new

get bust living or get busy dying

anger is energy if you hold on to it it’ll infect you but if you channel it into something positive — great things are possible

lead us to a place where we can gain a better sense and see more love more truth more grace toward thee and grant us more humility

this is an assignment im always happy to be on helping a hurting world through the power of prayer

all humans are images of your own self

we run after love for fear of abandonment we run after pleasure for fear of pain we are not made to run after something but to live what we already are

the principles of human design

you are a unique being the combination of who you are and why you are here is as unique as your finger prints

it’s much easier to be who you really are than who you think you should be

you are who you are and nothing can change that you’re beautiful just as you are

human design helps you remember who you are you were born perfectly and nothing has changed

human design is about making decisions that are right for you versus what’s right for anyone else

you don’t need to be fixed you’re perfect just the way you are

you’re here for a reason the world is waiting for the authentic you to emerge

human design allows you to be the you you were born to be you don’t need to take anything personally it’s just energy

if each one of us were living our unique strategy the world would be a lovely and very livable place

you are designed to receive love and everything you need to survive the universe is always taking care of you by default if you allow it

human design is about selfawareness getting to know yourself better so you can be happier healthier more prosperous and more fulfilled

things should flow easily when you’re living your design there’s no pushing hard when you’re in the flow relationships job offers money fulfillment will flow to you and through you naturally

you are your own nearest environment so begin with yourself

different religions means different things to different people

here are the basic principles of spirituality  there are none

for me yoga provides the answer to every question and the solution to every problem

and you stop needing to have the experience of

heartbreak when you realize you are already whole

spirituality is all about connection  connection with inner self and the self that is in every being

love is its own reward we do not have to worry about what other people think about us we can never feel alone or isolated when we understand that it is impossible for love to leave our side love is all around us

religion is the path of divisions boundaries and narrowness spirituality is the path of love light beauty and oneness

spirituality is developing much more trust believe and faith in your own strength than in your own weakness

a society or community is really free when you really have a home and can think freely write freely and study many aspects without selfcensorship

theology is the crown of philosophy

the way is not narrow it’s wide everyone is welcome however we have to know that we are welcome or we keep the door shut ourselves

and yosef joseph could not control himself for all the postedpersons upon him and he called out remove every man from upon me and a man did not stand with him in the confessing of yosef joseph to his brothers

and he gave his voice in crying and they heard – all of mitzraim egypt – and the house of pharaoh heard

and yosef joseph said to his brothers i am yosef does my father still live and his brothers could not answer him because they were terrified from his face

religion for me is just a tool to connect ourselves to god the creator what i believe is that as a human we are entitled to learn to study in all aspects of our lives

the energy body acts as a bridge connecting our physical and spiritual bodies in order for us to influence transformation of the body and mind we must first learn to transform the energy flow

life would not seem short if we valued time as much as we value money

ours is an illusionless humanism that cares about protecting our species especially from itself we must forgive humanity and ourselves for being what we are – neither angels nor beasts

it’s all become so beautifully strange

the greatest lie ever sold to mankind is that it needs to be better stronger faster and more powerful than it already was intended to be when it was created in the beginning

all of the great ones are selfless

beyond anything we know to name there moves a force arising from the pure juxtaposition of things a force that draws us into being that allows us to dwell fully in our lives all pure juxtaposition is a gathering

the weak or the majority choose comfortable chaos the wise man laughs

one is only truly free in the eye of the storm

truth the pain the beauty so that the telling of it is sacred

no need to try to find it said unroy the sacredness is there in the truth the pain the beauty so that the telling of it is sacred

the death of the human body is not only inevitable but necessary too just as you’d never wish to be forced as an adult to wear clothes you haven’t fit into since you were five the soul needs to move on and away from the body it outgrows it

ego when given the chance will direct all thoughts and actions to its own purpose and passion it hijacks all work of the soul and runs the mind and body completely contrary to the soul’s mission

choosing the good of all is always your highest calling even if that means people don’t like you for it being liked is meaningless if real love is not at the heart of your purpose

allow things in your life which make your heart sing feed your soul or nourish you on a daily basis

the earth is a playground but your spirit is no child you are a seasoned veteran of soul caught up in the entrapments of human desire and as the body’s resident higher self it’s up to you to help that body behave responsibly whenever possible

it seems human beings have a great inability to see their own godhood except when pronouncing judgment on others

all parents were once babies and children themselves so try to remember this when observing parents from afar adults are just children who have grown up—they’re toddlers with longer legs

while on earth your soul will never stop glowing with the ethereal light you will be within yourself an eternal flame a reminder that you are now and forever something greater than the human body you inhabit

people don’t just watch the horrible news happening around the world they take it in like food they feed themselves with all the pain and suffering because they think digesting it this way will somehow make them more immune to it

there were so many times along that path when the voice within felt compelled to ask me whether my existence had any value whether my life had any purpose or meaning

prayer is the soul’s nursery where hopes and dreams find sustenance where makebelieve awakens into faith proved real

true understanding is an indivisible land of liberation beyond all judgement and all conclusions

being able to uplift others is the biggest miracle in the world

romantic soul seeketh love but a loving heart finds god

when we lose our spiritual vocabulary we lose much more than words we lose the power of speaking grace forgiveness love and justice over others

my childhood was hurtful enough but a church hurt leaves lasting detrimental wounds associated with a place of refuge

but when highprofile politicians speak god in the most perfunctory manner possible its no wonder supporters and opponents alike avoid speaking god altogether

when need for the supreme vanishes the nascent value of incorrigibilty tends to infinity

sitting for meditation is the classic technique for a reason being physically still can help you still your mind

as the grounding effect of breath awareness disengages you from the oftenoverwhelming chatter of the mind the level at which you think will seem to transcend the noise

as a result of regular mindfulness practice you’ll begin to see your role in different circumstances recognize your oppor tunities to grow and develop a relationship with yourself that is more loving forgiving and open to new possibilities

attention focused on the breath redirects your awareness from outside your body to inside it it is an exercise in controlling the focus of your awareness

in zazen you create the conditions for your mind to decompress from its habitual mode of thinking and open up to new perspectives and insight

zazen can ultimately retrain your mind to see the world from an entirely new perspective

zazen practice develops our understanding of our connectedness to the world into which we were born the world in which we live—which is also the world we are creating together moment by moment

zen is an especially intriguing school of buddhism because it brings to mind paradoxical images of monks happily living quiet lives meditating on mountaintops as well as powerful martial artists

the monks find comfort contentment and even joy in the simplest of tasks living each moment to its fullest by grounding themselves in the present

in the everaccelerating modern world with new technology constantly bombarding our senses and demanding schedules pulling us in different directions the benefits of a practice like zazen are easy to overlook but profoundly powerful to practice

slowly and steadily as the rush to gain the benefits of meditation fades away and the depth of the experience itself becomes apparent your patience will strengthen and your need to be moving on to the next moment will begin to recede

unlike many other traditions in zen emphasis is placed on the direct experience of enlightenment—experiencing insight through meditation—rather than on the study of the sacred texts of eastern traditions

the chronic tension the average person experiences in modern life finds its way deep into the body and we live most of our lives in the whiplash of past experiences—mentally rehashing and physically reexperiencing past stressors

the practice of breath awareness relieves tension by shifting attention to the present and the mental pressures of worries concerns and ambitions lift

zazen is a great technique to start with because it is so straight forward and uncomplicated

appreciating the simple things the great temporary gift of life and the beauty in all aspects of living is perhaps one of the most power ful fulfilling benefits of practicing breath awareness

by choosing to become aware you choose to take back control of your attention and perspective which can transform even mundane tasks such as washing dishes or making coffee into something joyful and beautiful

if your mind wanders all that means is that you’re alive and your brain is functioning normally which is great news

in the modern world there seems to be a collective understanding of the word zen—it has become synonymous with serenity relaxation and a calm demeanor

your mind wanders you bring it back this is the exercise—and the practice—of meditation

thoughts are the input and output of the mental process making thoughts is what the brain is built for—like the heart beats the mind thinks

be aware that the concept of meditation is to shift your focus to the awareness of the thinking process rather than the content of the thoughts

achieving the advanced state of nothought is not about stopping the thinking process but rather it’s about cultivating an expansive sensitivity to a level above the thinking mind

find your soul

and keep it in your heart

feed it honor it

for what it is your presence

in this world open

river most mighty

waiting for the sun to melt

and wonder when you rise

you will walk another step

and not some other

the rest of your life

looking for a mystery

to take over your life

sit down with some small detail

let it settle like cream

in your coffee swirling

my highest aspiration is to love without limits and without ego

spirituality is not taking shelter under religions or prophets but making deep union with the god that exist in every heart

for a woman who fears she is too damaged to love again

a prayer adapted from the heart and soul of sex by gina ogden phd

holy spirits of fire befriend and warm me

earth and water wrap me in bounty

spirits of air guide me to walk the paths of my heart

sun smile on me stones accept me stars remind me

ocean storms burnish my terrors to translucent pearls

creatures of hills and hollows beings beneath the ground watch over me comfort and nourish me

snakes and rivers ancient dragons dance sinuously with me

swirling spirit of volcano invest me with power

eagle and sparrow give me wings and sight

cherish me—waif and victim elf and amazon

see me a holy woman now touch me

brush me with the breath of love

ganesh sacred elephant who cries human tears and oversees new ventures help me begin again

with a beginner’s mind we can all become more fluid in our understanding and thereby pave the way for a more fulfilling and balanced future

a beginner’s mind allows you to remain flexible and open even as you encounter new things that may seem strange or even uncomfortable at first

the lord is in you and only in you without the human mind to construct an overexaggerated idea of the lord there is no actual lord of humanity except for humanity itself

count on your beginners mind to help you through any times when you might feel resistant or selfconscious about your practice

i’ve realized people can live in a world they’ve personally constructed through a distorted lens of guilt and shame whether they deserve it or not

to live the life is

to be no cause of grief to anyone

to be kind to all people and to love them with a pure spirit

should opposition or injury happen to us to bear it to be as kind as ever can be and through all to love the people should calamity exist in the greatest degree to rejoice for these things are the gifts and favors of god

to be silent concerning the faults of others to pray for them and to help them through kindness to correct their faults

to look always at the good and not at the bad if a man has ten good qualities and one bad one look at the ten and forget the one and if a man has ten bad qualities and one good one to look at the one and forget the ten

never to allow ourselves to speak one unkind word about another even though that other be our enemy

to do all of our deeds in kindness

to cut our hearts from ourselves and from the world

to be humble

to be servants of each other and to know that we are less than anyone else

to be as one soul in many bodies for the more we love each other the nearer we shall be to god but to know that our love our unity our obedience must not be by confession but of reality

to act with cautiousness and wisdom

to be truthful

to be hospitable

to be reverent

to be the cause of healing for every sick one

a comforter for every sorrowful one

a pleasant water for every thirsty one

a heavenly table for every hungry one

a star to every horizon

a light for every lamp

a herald to everyone who yearns for the kingdom of god

the world is dominated by those who ascend into the higher powers in the spiritual realms

in our hearts when we choose to see people differently they start to change we participate in the healing of people

we can choose to say somewhere in this person there is a light made in gods image

i am lord god so are you

do not look at the darkness covering the light instead see the light coming through the darkness

if you dont know the purpose of your life there is no point in living

neither to heaven nor to hell my journey is towards my home

this is not a conventional howto book it contains no exercises and it has few formulas saying first do this then do that

this is intentional as we’ll see later eros doesn’t like to be told what to do if you set a goal your sexual mind will be happy to reject it it’s kind of childish and brilliant that way

i’ll also spare you the body diagrams you already know what a penis and vagina look like right and we won’t discuss how many neurons are concentrated in your clitoris it’s an impressive number but who really cares

this book is not intended to get you hard or wet but it’s meant not to get in your way either the chapters are short so you can read them even if you get a little distracted hey i hope you get a little distracted

there are no lists to memorize and there won’t be a test afterwards we’re dealing with a part of the human mind that hasn’t gone to school yet and never will

any questions

ok let’s get started

in so many ways

that eventually you will become one like me

the religious mysteries direct us toward the true nature of reality that we are unaware of religion opens our mind and spirit to the greater reality much of what we call supernatural is only what we don’t understand

the great sun moving in the heavenly houses has left the house of the fishes for the house of the waterbearer in the coming age shall humanity be holy and in the perfection of

the human shall we find the humane take up the manhood into godhead and bring down the godhead into manhood and this shall be the day of god with us for god is made manifest in nature and nature is the selfexpression of god

we may meet so many people along this long road

but it is of no use

until we finally meet ourselves

each star twinkles with its own energy it holds within human’s energy is hidden deep in their soul my ancestors said that when your soul burns bright you twinkle just like the star your eyes twinkle just like the stars

if you ever lose someone dear to you never say the words theyre gone theyll come back

dream big dream fearless and dream beyond limits

visualize it believe and take action do not allow anything or anyone to hinder or limit you

challenges come to strengthen you no it is not easy but worth it

when you light up the lamp of awareness the ignorance and fear disappear

i have finally come to the realisation that nothing is truer than our own manifestation

i mean society sucks everything is backwards and i am awake in a world alone full of ignorant minds toxic belief systems and sleeping souls

my mind is a bed of soil for me to plant my seeds i need to keep my soil healthy

i have to water my seeds with actions and in the warmth of presence day by day i appreciate watching my plants grow

i am fluid i am objective and i make noise waking the sleeping souls around me as my garden comes to life

lead by example

in this human world the misery of the humans can only be lifted by the humans who are courageous and conscientious enough to take real actions instead of meekly hoping and praying for an illusory divine intervention

every relationship is a lovelesson

let your action glitter with real holiness  and then only will the world witness the manifestation of real religion  the religion of love  the religion of compassion  the religion of service

the kingdom of god is not a place  its a people  the humans  all humans

you my friend are the only being who can become nay who are the only real living messiah on earth to make real impact upon the lives that are infested with the everdarkening darkness of hopelessness

as the hands of time sweep past the minutes of our life

as i begin to walk the path towards you

i hear the echo of a song

if your heartbeats whisper my name

leave the door to your heart ajar

the divinity you seek lies in the exuberant realm of protoplasm inside your own skull

let the poor be your god and your service to them be your religion

godliness matters not god

its better to live for five days as an unconditioned liberated human being than to live for a thousand years as a dead conditioned secondhand human body

live as a messiah or not at all  a messiah of compassion  a messiah of courage  a messiah of conscience

if only we the genuine humans had the real guts and sense of real responsibility to act as the holy warriors on our own original beliefs and principles then we wouldn’t see any trace of terrorism in the world whatsoever religious or otherwise

mind you o braveheart sibling of mine courage conscience and compassion these are the real trinity of a civilized society

gratitude is the attitude

it is in between our two breaths that we think of as nothing rests our life as if suspended for the glimmer of a moment

here abides the secret beyond all secrets

− what is it

− you must become a wind

real religion can only be realized by lionhearts who have the guts to go against all predominant prejudices of the society not by sheep of books

for any country victory over political differences social injustice and economic crisis are necessary to peace and to undermining the forces of terrorism

violence cannot be religion and true religion cannot be violent

since i forgot to beg my alms yesterday

i am hungry and weak today

and since i am hungry and weak today

i didn’t beg my alms for tomorrow

what tomorrow will bring to me

i do not know i do not care

yet within this uncertainty

i am contented and gratified

that you chose me to be like this

overfilling my heart with love for you

and my soul thirsty dry for your love

that i die everynight crying for your love

and i born everyday for to love you again

all peace joy and love that we seek outside of ourselves are right within us

you cant always save someone by getting in the water with them sometimes you must lead by example and show them how to get on the boat

true fearlessness is not the reduction of fear but going beyond fear

well it’s every bit god’s word isn’t it leah said

god’s word brought to you by a crew of romantic idealists in a harsh desert culture eons ago followed by a chain of translators two thousand years long

leah stared at him

darling did you think god wrote it all down in the english of king james himself

no i guess not

think of all the duties that were perfectly obvious to paul or matthew in that old arabian desert that are pure nonsense to us now all that foot washing for example was it really for god’s glory or just to keep the sand out of the house

leah sat narroweyed in her chair for once stumped for the correct answer

miracles do happen in faith lies the power of spirituality

sieve through the noise break your habits abandon your identity and find yourself

the way

to your spirit

is through your body

i love art and music but without that and above all without people it would be pure nature and i derive from nature

to see through the mask of evil search for the light that is the essence of everything the fruit of this search is revelation the light reveals itself of its own accord

forced indoctrination exacts blind and ignorant obedience

thoughts are powerful generators of energy

i close my eyes and listen vaguely in a half sleep as he does the things he does before he sleeps each night brushing and squirting and splashing so many things people and their rituals they cling to things so hard sometimes

its done now tony said we cant change whats already been decided

everything outer in the world has an inner cause and every change we want in the outer world can only be truly effective and lasting if driven from within

your mind is your utmost freedom handled correctly fed properly and cared for lovingly you will cultivate that freedom the mind will expand see more clearly love more sincerely and know more acutely and wisely

sorry wakefield insists but what exactly is cultural imperialism

the boy turns his good eye to wakefield that when indian kids play with mickey mouse instead of kachinas kachinas mean something to their people the mouse means nothing

he must mean something wakefield says

yeah he means money a kachina tells the story of the earth of the people of dances rituals how to make rain… talk to the fucking mouse and see what he tells you

the enemy is not as powerful as your attitude towards god

i cant change the world but i can always change my point of view
