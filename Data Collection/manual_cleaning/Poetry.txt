all that is gold does not glitter

not all those who wander are lost

the old that is strong does not wither

deep roots are not reached by the frost

from the ashes a fire shall be woken

a light from the shadows shall spring

renewed shall be blade that was broken

the crownless again shall be king

i love you as certain dark things are to be loved

in secret between the shadow and the soul

only the very weakminded refuse to be influenced by literature and poetry

music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent

the road not taken

and sorry i could not travel both

and be one traveler long i stood

and looked down one as far as i could

to where it bent in the undergrowth

then took the other as just as fair

and having perhaps the better claim

because it was grassy and wanted wear

though as for that the passing there

had worn them really about the same

and both that morning equally lay

in leaves no step had trodden black

oh i kept the first for another day

yet knowing how way leads on to way

i doubted if i should ever come back

i shall be telling this with a sigh

somewhere ages and ages hence

two roads diverged in a wood and i—

i took the one less traveled by

and that has made all the difference

we love the things we love for what they are

i carry your heart with me i carry it in my hearti am never without it anywhere

i go you gomy dear and whatever is done by only me is your doingmy darling

i fear no fate for you are my fatemy sweeti want no world for beautiful you are my worldmy true

and its you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you

here is the deepest secret nobody knows

here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life which grows

higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide

and this is the wonder thats keeping the stars apart

i carry your heart i carry it in my heart

you talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts

every heart sings a song incomplete until another heart whispers back those who wish to sing always find a song at the touch of a lover everyone becomes a poet

tell me what is it you plan to do

with your one wild and precious life

if youre reading this

congratulations youre alive

if thats not something to smile about

then i dont know what is

i have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night

painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen

to be nobody but

yourself in a world

which is doing its best day and night to make you like

everybody else means to fight the hardest battle

which any human being can fight and never stop fighting

unbeing dead isnt being alive

a poem begins as a lump in the throat a sense of wrong a homesickness a lovesickness

some say the world will end in fire

some say in ice

from what ive tasted of desire

i hold with those who favor fire

but if it had to perish twice

i think i know enough of hate

to say that for destruction ice

and would suffice

poets have been mysteriously silent on the subject of cheese

you do not have to be good

you do not have to walk on your knees

for a hundred miles through the desert repenting

you only have to let the soft animal of your body

love what it loves

tell me about despair yours and i will tell you mine

meanwhile the world goes on

meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain

are moving across the landscapes

over the prairies and the deep trees

the mountains and the rivers

meanwhile the wild geese high in the clean blue air

are heading home again

whoever you are no matter how lonely

the world offers itself to your imagination

calls to you like the wild geese harsh and exciting –

over and over announcing your place

in the family of things

trees are poems the earth writes upon the sky we fell them down and turn them into paper

that we may record our emptiness

one ought every day at least to hear a little song read a good poem see a fine picture and if it were possible to speak a few reasonable words

i crave your mouth your voice your hair

silent and starving i prowl through the streets

bread does not nourish me dawn disrupts me all day

i hunt for the liquid measure of your steps

i hunger for your sleek laugh

your hands the color of a savage harvest

hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails

i want to eat your skin like a whole almond

i want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body

the sovereign nose of your arrogant face

i want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes

and i pace around hungry sniffing the twilight

hunting for you for your hot heart

like a puma in the barrens of quitratue

if you are a dreamer come in

if you are a dreamer a wisher a liar

if youre a pretender com sit by my fire

for we have some flax golden tales to spin

what is that you express in your eyes it seems to me more than all the print i have read in my life

she only looked away for a moment and the mask slipped and you fell all your tomorrows start here

still round the corner there may wait

a new road or a secret gate

and though i oft have passed them by

a day will come at last when i

shall take the hidden paths that run

west of the moon east of the sun

i shut my eyes and all the world drops dead

i lift my eyes and all is born again

let our scars fall in love

only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go

as it has been said

love and a cough

cannot be concealed

forgive o lord my little jokes on thee

and ill forgive thy great big one on me

this is the way the world ends

not with a bang but a whimper

if i had my life to live over again i would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week

you only live twice

once when you are born

and once when you look death in the face

if you have the words theres always a chance that youll find the way

though my soul may set in darkness it will rise in perfect light

i have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night

always be a poet even in prose

watch out for intellect

because it knows so much it knows nothing

and leaves you hanging upside down

mouthing knowledge as your heart

falls out of your mouth

poetry is what gets lost in translation

there is a pleasure in the pathless woods

there is a rapture on the lonely shore

there is society where none intrudes

by the deep sea and music in its roar

i love not man the less but nature more

poetry is what happens when nothing else can

one should always be drunk thats all that mattersbut with what with wine with poetry or with virtue as you chose but get drunk

what a strange thing

to be alive

i like this place and could willingly waste my time in it

and then i have nature and art and poetry and if that is not enough what is enough

we shall not cease from exploration

and the end of all our exploring

will be to arrive where we started

and know the place for the first time

you might as well ask an artist to explain his art or ask a poet to explain his poem it defeats the purpose the meaning is only clear thorough the search

ho ho ho to the bottle i go

to heal my heart and drown my woe

rain may fall and wind may blow

and many miles be still to go

but under a tall tree will i lie

and let the clouds go sailing by

to live in this world

you must be able

to do three things

to love what is mortal

to hold it

against your bones knowing

your own life depends on it

and when the time comes to let it go

to let it go

let me not to the marriage of true minds

admit impediments love is not love

which alters when it alteration finds

or bends with the remover to remove

o no it is an everfixed mark

that looks on tempests and is never shaken

it is the star to every wandring barque

whose worths unknown although his height be taken

loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks

within his bending sickles compass come

love alters not with his brief hours and weeks

but bears it out even to the edge of doom

if this be error and upon me proved

i never writ nor no man ever loved

do i dare

disturb the universe

in a minute there is time

for decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse

i like my body when it is with your

body it is so quite new a thing

muscles better and nerves more

i like your body i like what it does

i like its hows i like to feel the spine

of your body and its bones and the trembling

firmsmooth ness and which i will

again and again and again

kiss i like kissing this and that of you

i like slowly stroking the shocking fuzz

of your electric fur and whatisit comes

over parting flesh  and eyes big lovecrumbs

and possibly i like the thrill

of under me you so quite new

far over the misty mountains cold

to dungeons deep and caverns old

we must away ere break of day

to seek the pale enchanted gold

the dwarves of yore made mighty spells

while hammers fell like ringing bells

in places deep where dark things sleep

in hollow halls beneath the fells

for ancient king and elvish lord

there many a gleaming golden hoard

they shaped and wrought and light they caught

to hide in gems on hilt of sword

on silver necklaces they strung

the flowering stars on crowns they hung

the dragonfire in twisted wire

they meshed the light of moon and sun

far over the misty mountains cold

to dungeons deep and caverns old

we must away ere break of day

to claim our longforgotten gold

goblets they carved there for themselves

and harps of gold where no man delves

there lay they long and many a song

was sung unheard by men or elves

the pines were roaring on the height

the wind was moaning in the night

the fire was red it flaming spread

the trees like torches blazed with light

the bells were ringing in the dale

and men looked up with faces pale

the dragons ire more fierce than fire

laid low their towers and houses frail

the mountain smoked beneath the moon

the dwarves they heard the tramp of doom

they fled their hall to dying fall

beneath his feet beneath the moon

far over the misty mountains grim

to dungeons deep and caverns dim

we must away ere break of day

to win our harps and gold from him

the little boy and the old man

said the little boy sometimes i drop my spoon

said the old man i do that too

the little boy whispered i wet my pants

i do that too laughed the little old man

said the little boy i often cry

the old man nodded so do i

but worst of all said the boy it seems

grownups dont pay attention to me

and he felt the warmth of a wrinkled old hand

i know what you mean said the little old man

i have drunken deep of joy

and i will taste no other wine tonight

there is freedom waiting for you

on the breezes of the sky

and you ask what if i fall

oh but my darling

what if you fly

there is not a particle of life which does not bear poetry within it

poetry might be defined as the clear expression of mixed feelings

my turn shall also come

i sense the spreading of a wing

i am awaiting

perpetually and forever

break a vase and the love that reassembles the fragments is stronger than that love which took its symmetry for granted when it was whole

even the stars

are whispering to each other

listen there’s a hell

of a good universe next door let’s go

once poets were magicians poets were strong stronger than warriors or kings — stronger than old hapless gods and they will be strong once again

your absence has gone through me

like thread through a needle

everything i do is stitched with its color

poetry heals the wounds inflicted by reason

poetry is eternal graffiti written in the heart of everyone

the journey

one day you finally knew

what you had to do and began

though the voices around you

their bad advice

though the whole house

began to tremble

and you felt the old tug

at your ankles

mend my life

each voice cried

but you didnt stop

you knew what you had to do

though the wind pried

with its stiff fingers

at the very foundations

though their melancholy

it was already late

enough and a wild night

and the road full of fallen

branches and stones

but little by little

as you left their voices behind

the stars began to burn

through the sheets of clouds

and there was a new voice

which you slowly

recognized as your own

that kept you company

as you strode deeper and deeper

into the world

determined to do

the only thing you could do

determined to save

the only life you could save

because of you in gardens of blossoming

flowers i ache from the perfumes of spring

i have forgotten your face i no longer

remember your hands how did your lips

because of you i love the white statues

drowsing in the parks the white statues that

have neither voice nor sight

i have forgotten your voice your happy voice

i have forgotten your eyes

like a flower to its perfume i am bound to

my vague memory of you i live with pain

that is like a wound if you touch me you will

make to me an irreperable harm

your caresses enfold me like climbing

i have forgotten your love yet i seem to

glimpse you in every window

because of you the heady perfumes of

summer pain me because of you i again

seek out the signs that precipitate desires

do not go gentle into that good night

old age should burn and rave at close of day

rage rage against the dying of the light

perhaps the truth depends on a walk around the lake

i may not always be with you

but when were far apart

remember you will be with me

right inside my heart

poetry is the shadow cast by our streetlight imaginations

anon who wrote so many poems without signing them was often a woman

dont use the phone people are never ready to answer it use poetry

the rain to the wind said

you push and ill pelt

they so smote the garden bed

that the flowers actually knelt

and lay lodgedthough not dead

i know how the flowers felt

love consists of this two solitudes that meet protect and greet each other

i dreamed i spoke in anothers language

i dreamed i lived in anothers skin

i dreamed i was my own beloved

i dreamed i was a tigers kin

i dreamed that eden lived inside me

and when i breathed a garden came

i dreamed i knew all of creation

i dreamed i knew the creators name

i dreamedand this dream was the finest

that all i dreamed was real and true

and we would live in joy forever

you in me and me in you

those who are willing to be vulnerable move among mysteries

out of the night that covers me

black as the pit from pole to pole

i thank whatever gods may be

for my unconquerable soul

in the fell clutch of circumstance

i have not winced nor cried aloud

under the bludgeonings of chance

my head is bloody but unbowed

beyond this place of wrath and tears

looms but the horror of the shade

and yet the menace of the years

finds and shall find me unafraid

it matters not how strait the gate

how charged with punishments the scroll

i am the master of my fate

i am the captain of my soul

if i read a book and it makes my whole body so cold no fire can warm me i know that is poetry if i feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off i know that is poetry these are the only ways i know it is there any other way

go into yourself find out the reason that commands you to write see whether it has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart confess to yourself whether you would have to die if you were forbidden to write

april is the cruelest month breeding

lilacs out of the dead land mixing

memory and desire stirring

dull roots with spring rain

some of you say joy is greater than sorrow and others say nay sorrow is the greater

but i say unto you they are inseparable

together they come and when one sits alone with you at your board remember that the other is asleep upon your bed

to the waters and the wild

with a faery hand in hand

for the worlds more full of weeping than you can understand

music is the universal language of mankind

i know youre tired but come this is the way

she walks in beauty like the night

of cloudless climes and starry skies

and all thats best of dark and bright

meet in her aspect and her eyes

extinguish my eyes ill go on seeing you

seal my ears ill go on hearing you

and without feet i can make my way to you

without a mouth i can swear your name

break off my arms ill take hold of you

with my heart as with a hand

stop my heart and my brain will start to beat

and if you consume my brain with fire

ill feel you burn in every drop of my blood

i dont care what you say to me i care what you share with me

love the poet said is womans whole existence

all my heart is yours sir it belongs to you and with you it would remain were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence forever

stephen kissed me in the spring

robin in the fall

but colin only looked at me

and never kissed at all

stephen’s kiss was lost in jest

robin’s lost in play

but the kiss in colin’s eyes

haunts me night and day

you give but little when you give of your possessions

it is when you give of yourself that you truly give

love is heavy and light bright and dark hot and cold sick and healthy asleep and awake its everything except what it is act  scene

though much is taken much abides and though

we are not now that strength which in old days

moved earth and heaven that which we are we are

made weak by time and fate but strong in will

to strive to seek to find and not to yield

given the choice between the experience of pain and nothing i would choose pain

when great trees fall

when great trees fall

lions hunker down

and even elephants

lumber after safety

when great trees fall

small things recoil into silence

their senses

the air around us becomes

we breathe briefly

our eyes briefly

see with

our memory suddenly sharpened

our reality bound to

them takes leave of us

our souls

dependent upon their

now shrink wizened

our minds formed

and informed by their

we are not so much maddened

as reduced to the unutterable ignorance

and when great souls die

after a period peace blooms

slowly and always

with a kind of

our senses restored never

to be the same whisper to us

they existed they existed

we can be be and be

better for they existed

live not for battles won

live not for theendofthesong

live in the along

we the mortals touch the metals

the wind the ocean shores the stones

knowing they will go on inert or burning

and i was discovering naming all the these things

it was my destiny to love and say goodbye

tears idle tears i know not what they mean

tears from the depths of some devine despair

rise in the heart and gather to the eyes

in looking on the happy autumn fields

and thinking of the days that are no more

the purpose of life is to be defeated by greater and greater things

i turned silences and nights into words what was unutterable i wrote down i made the whirling world stand still

i love a sunburnt country

of droughts and flooding rains

her beauty and her terror –

the wide brown land for me

i want to think again of dangerous and noble things

i want to be light and frolicsome

i want to be improbable beautiful and afraid of nothing

as though i had wings

the tides are in our veins we still mirror the stars life is your child but there is in me

older and harder than life and more impartial the eye that watched before there was an ocean

i want you to tell me about every person you’ve ever been in love with

tell me why you loved them

then tell me why they loved you

tell me about a day in your life you didn’t think you’d live through

tell me what the word home means to you

and tell me in a way that i’ll know your mother’s name

just by the way you describe your bedroom

when you were eight

see i want to know the first time you felt the weight of hate

and if that day still trembles beneath your bones

do you prefer to play in puddles of rain

or bounce in the bellies of snow

and if you were to build a snowman

would you rip two branches from a tree to build your snowman arms

or would leave your snowman armless

for the sake of being harmless to the tree

and if you would

would you notice how that tree weeps for you

because your snowman has no arms to hug you

every time you kiss him on the cheek

do you kiss your friends on the cheek

do you sleep beside them when they’re sad

even if it makes your lover mad

do you think that anger is a sincere emotion

or just the timid motion of a fragile heart trying to beat away its pain

see i wanna know what you think of your first name

and if you often lie awake at night and imagine your mother’s joy

when she spoke it for the very first time

i want you to tell me all the ways you’ve been unkind

tell me all the ways you’ve been cruel

tell me knowing i often picture gandhi at ten years old

beating up little boys at school

if you were walking by a chemical plant

where smokestacks were filling the sky with dark black clouds

would you holler poison poison poison really loud

or would you whisper

that cloud looks like a fish

and that cloud looks like a fairy

do you believe that mary was really a virgin

do you believe that moses really parted the sea

and if you don’t believe in miracles tell me —

how would you explain the miracle of my life to me

see i wanna know if you believe in any god

or if you believe in many gods

or better yet

what gods believe in you

and for all the times that you’ve knelt before the temple of yourself

have the prayers you asked come true

and if they didn’t did you feel denied

and if you felt denied

denied by who

i wanna know what you see when you look in the mirror

on a day you’re feeling good

i wanna know what you see when you look in the mirror

on a day you’re feeling bad

i wanna know the first person who taught you your beauty

could ever be reflected on a lousy piece of glass

if you ever reach enlightenment

will you remember how to laugh

have you ever been a song

would you think less of me

if i told you i’ve lived my entire life a little offkey

and i’m not nearly as smart as my poetry

i just plagiarize the thoughts of the people around me

who have learned the wisdom of silence

do you believe that concrete perpetuates violence

and if you do —

i want you to tell me of a meadow

where my skateboard will soar

see i wanna know more than what you do for a living

i wanna know how much of your life you spend just giving

and if you love yourself enough to also receive sometimes

i wanna know if you bleed sometimes

from other people’s wounds

and if you dream sometimes

that this life is just a balloon —

that if you wanted to you could pop

but you never would

‘cause you’d never want it to stop

if a tree fell in the forest

and you were the only one there to hear —

if its fall to the ground didn’t make a sound

would you panic in fear that you didn’t exist

or would you bask in the bliss of your nothingness

and lastly let me ask you this

if you and i went for a walk

and the entire walk we didn’t talk —

do you think eventually we’d… kiss

no wait

that’s asking too much —

after all

this is only our first date

you

not wanting me

the beginning of me

wanting myself

thank you

poetry is just so emo he said oh the pain the pain it always rains in my soul

the death of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world

the poetry of the earth is never dead

grief is a house

where the chairs

have forgotten how to hold us

the mirrors how to reflect us

the walls how to contain us

grief is a house that disappears

each time someone knocks at the door

or rings the bell

a house that blows into the air

at the slightest gust

that buries itself deep in the ground

while everyone is sleeping

grief is a house where no one can protect you

where the younger sister

will grow older than the older one

where the doors

no longer let you in

or out

a good poem is a contribution to reality the world is never the same once a good poem has been added to it a good poem helps to change the shape of the universe helps to extend everyones knowledge of himself and the world around him

dont go far off not even for a day

because i dont know how to say it  a day is long

and i will be waiting for you as in

an empty station when the trains are

parked off somewhere else asleep

dont leave me even for an hour because then

the little drops of anguish will all run together

the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift

into me choking my lost heart

oh may your silhouette never dissolve

on the beach may your eyelids never flutter

into the empty distance dont leave me for

a second my dearest because in that moment youll

have gone so far ill wander mazily

over all the earth asking will you

come back will you leave me here dying

some moments are nice some are

nicer some are even worth

about

closed in a room my imagination becomes the universe and the rest of the world is missing out

my candle burns at both ends

it will not last the night

but ah my foes and oh my friends—

it gives a lovely light

i am no longer in love with her thats certain but maybe i love her love is so short forgetting is so long

dare to love yourself

as if you were a rainbow

with gold at both ends

im nobody who are you

are you nobody too

then there ’s a pair of us—don’t tell

they ’d banish us you know

how dreary to be somebody

how public like a frog

to tell your name the livelong day

to an admiring bog

to be a poet is a condition not a profession

genuine poetry can communicate before it is understood

love is not love

which alters when it alteration finds

or bends with the remover to remove

o no it is an everfixed mark

that looks on tempests and is never shaken

it is the star to every wandring bark

whose worths unknown although his height be taken

time does not bring relief

time does not bring relief you all have lied

who told me time would ease me of my pain

i miss him in the weeping of the rain

i want him at the shrinking of the tide

the old snows melt from every mountainside

and last year’s leaves are smoke in every lane

but last year’s bitter loving must remain

heaped on my heart and my old thoughts abide

there are a hundred places where i fear

to go—so with his memory they brim

and entering with relief some quiet place

where never fell his foot or shone his face

i say there is no memory of him here

and so stand stricken so remembering him

may came home with a smooth round stone

as small as a world and as large as alone

though nothing can bring back the hour

of splendor in the grass of glory in the flower

we will grieve not rather find

strength in what remains behind

in the primal sympathy

which having been must ever be

how i go to the woods

ordinarily i go to the woods alone with not a single

friend for they are all smilers and talkers and therefore

i don’t really want to be witnessed talking to the catbirds

or hugging the old black oak tree i have my way of

praying as you no doubt have yours

besides when i am alone i can become invisible i can sit

on the top of a dune as motionless as an uprise of weeds

until the foxes run by unconcerned i can hear the almost

unhearable sound of the roses singing

if you have ever gone to the woods with me i must love

you very much

love one another but make not a bond of love

let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls

take this kiss upon the brow

and in parting from you now

you are not wrong who deem

that my days have been a dream

yet if hope has flown away

in a night or in a day

in a vision or in none

is it therefore the less gone

all that we see or seem

is but a dream within a dream

i stand amid the roar

and i hold within my hand

grains of the golden sand

how few yet how they creep

through my fingers to the deep

while i weep while i weep

o god can i not grasp

them with a tighter clasp

o god can i not save

one from the pitiless wave

is all that we see or seem

but a dream within a dream

always learn poems by heart they have to become the marrow in your bones like fluoride in the water theyll make your soul impervious to the worlds soft decay

poetry is just the evidence of life if your life is burning well poetry is just the ash

how do i love thee let me count the ways

i love thee to the depth and breadth and height

my soul can reach when feeling out of sight

for the ends of being and ideal grace

i love thee to the level of every days

most quiet need by sun and candlelight

i love thee purely as they turn from praise

i love thee with the passion put to use

in my old griefs and with my childhoods faith

i love thee with a love i seemed to lose

with my lost saints i love thee with the breath

smiles tears of all my life and if god choose

i shall but love thee better after death

if your daily life seems poor do not blame it blame yourself tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches for to the creator there is no poverty and no poor indifferent place

the stars are not wanted now put out every one

pack up the moon and dismantle the sun

pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood

for nothing now can ever come to any good

poetry she thought wasnt written to be analyzed it was meant to inspire without reason to touch without understanding

lifes not a paragraph

and death i think is no parenthesis

into the darkness they go the wise and the lovely

there is a pleasure in the pathless woods

there is a rapture on the lonely shore

there is society where none intrudes

by the deep sea and music in its roar

i love not man the less but nature more

from these our interviews in which i steal

from all i may be or have been before

to mingle with the universe and feel

what i can ne’er express yet cannot all conceal

i love the silent hour of night

for blissful dreams may then arise

revealing to my charmed sight

what may not bless my waking eyes

with me poetry has not been a purpose but a passion

it was at that age

that poetry came in search of me

i lean to you numb as a fossil tell me im here

he was my north my south my east and west

my working week and my sunday rest

my noon my midnight my talk my song

i thought that love would last forever i was wrong

if i can see pain in your eyes then share with me your tears if i can see joy in your eyes then share with me your smile

the peace of wild things

when despair for the world grows in me

and i wake in the night at the least sound

in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be

i go and lie down where the wood drake

rests in his beauty on the water and the great heron feeds

i come into the peace of wild things

who do not tax their lives with forethought

of grief i come into the presence of still water

and i feel above me the dayblind stars

waiting with their light for a time

i rest in the grace of the world and am free

the breezes at dawn have secrets to tell you

dont go back to sleep

you must ask for what you really want

dont go back to sleep

people are going back and forth

across the doorsill where the two worlds touch

the door is round and open

dont go back to sleep

do not look for healing

at the feet of those

who broke you

beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror

but you are eternity and you are the mirror

lovers and madmen have such seething brains

such shaping fantasies that apprehend

more than cool reason ever comprehends

the lunatic the lover and the poet

are of imagination all compact

one sees more devils than vast hell can hold

that is the madman the lover all as frantic

sees helens beauty in a brow of egypt

the poets eye in fine frenzy rolling

doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven

and as imagination bodies forth

the forms of things unknown the poets pen

turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing

a local habitation and a name

you can take this mouth

this wound you want

but you cant kiss

and make it

i went down to the river

i set down on the bank

i tried to think but couldnt

so i jumped in and sank

and did you get what

you wanted from this life even so

i did

and what did you want

to call myself beloved to feel myself

beloved on the earth

i carry your heart with mei carry it in my heart

there are things known

and there are things unknown

and in between are the doors

i discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake

o me o life of the questions of these recurring

of the endless trains of the faithless—of cities fill’d with the foolish

of myself forever reproaching myself for who more foolish than i and who more faithless

of eyes that vainly crave the light—of the objects mean—of the struggle ever renew’d

of the poor results of all—of the plodding and sordid crowds i see around me

of the empty and useless years of the rest—with the rest me intertwined

the question o me so sad recurring—what good amid these o me o life

that you are here—that life exists and identity

that the powerful play goes on and you will contribute a verse

the uses of sorrow

in my sleep i dreamed this poem

someone i loved once gave me

it took me years to understand

that this too was a gift

a word is dead

a word is dead

when it is said

some say

i say it just

begins to live

that day

it is strange how often a heart must be broken

before the years can make it wise

o serpent heart hid with a flowering face

did ever a dragon keep so fair a cave

beautiful tyrant feind angelical dove feather raven wolvishravening lamb despised substance of devinest show just opposite to what thou justly seemest  a dammed saint an honourable villain

green was the silence wet was the light

the month of june trembled like a butterfly

i am stuffing your mouth with your

promises and watching

you vomit them out upon my face

when you part from your friend you grieve not

for that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence as

the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain

i wanted all things

to seem to make some sense

so we could all be happy yes

and i made up lies

so that they all fit nice

and i made this sad world

we have calcium in our bones iron in our veins carbon in our souls and nitrogen in our brains  percent stardust with souls made of flames we are all just stars that have people names

be still sad heart and cease repining

behind the clouds is the sun still shining

thy fate is the common fate of all

into each life some rain must fall

the heart can think of no devotion

greater than being shore to the ocean

holding the curve of one position

counting an endless repetition

your hand

this is how

can you remember who you were before the world told you who you should be

i must create a system or be enslaved by another mans i will not reason and compare my business is to create

be silent and safe — silence never betrays you

be true to your word and your work and your friend

put least trust in him who is foremost to praise you

nor judge of a road till it draw to the end

still what i want in my life

is to be willing

to be dazzled—

to cast aside the weight of facts

and maybe even

to float a little

above this difficult world

i wandered lonely as a cloud

i wandered lonely as a cloud

that floats on high oer vales and hills

when all at once i saw a crowd

beside the lake beneath the trees

fluttering and dancing in the breeze

continuous as the stars that shine

and twinkle on the milky way

they stretched in neverending line

along the margin of a bay

ten thousand saw i at a glance

tossing their heads in sprightly dance

the waves beside them danced but they

outdid the sparkling waves in glee

a poet could not but be gay

in such a jocund company

i gazedand gazedbut little thought

what wealth the show to me had brought

for oft when on my couch i lie

in vacant or in pensive mood

they flash upon that inward eye

which is the bliss of solitude

and then my heart with pleasure fills

and dances with the daffodils

the midnight street

spins itself from under my feet

my eyes shut

these dreaming houses all snuff out

through a whim of mine

over gables the moons celestial onion

and trees diminish

by going far my looks leash

dangles the puppetpeople

who unaware how they dwindle

nor guess that if i choose to blink

when in good humour

give grass its green

blazon sky blue and endow the sun

with gold

yet in my wintriest moods i hold

to boycott color and forbid any flower

to be

know you appear

vivid at my side

denying you sprang out of my head

claiming you feel

love fiery enough to prove flesh real

though its quite clear

all your beauty all your wit is a gift my dear

from me

soliloquy of the solipsist

may my heart always be open to little

birds who are the secrets of living

whatever they sing is better than to know

and if men should not hear them men are old

may my mind stroll about hungry

and fearless and thirsty and supple

and even if its sunday may i be wrong

for whenever men are right they are not young

and may myself do nothing usefully

and love yourself so more than truly

theres never been quite such a fool who could fail

pulling all the sky over him with one smile

i am too alone in the world and yet not alone enough

to make every moment holy

i am too tiny in this world and not tiny enough

just to lie before you like a thing

shrewd and secretive

i want my own will and i want simply to be with my will

as it goes toward action

and in those quiet sometimes hardly moving times

when something is coming near

i want to be with those who know secret things

or else alone

i want to be a mirror for your whole body

and i never want to be blind or to be too old

to hold up your heavy and swaying picture

i want to unfold

i don’t want to stay folded anywhere

because where i am folded there i am a lie

and i want my grasp of things to be

true before you i want to describe myself

like a painting that i looked at

closely for a long time

like a saying that i finally understood

like the pitcher i use every day

like the face of my mother

that carried me

through the wildest storm of all

a free bird leaps on the back of the wind

and floats downstream till the current ends

and dips his wing in the orange suns rays and dares to claim the sky

but a bird that stalks down his narrow cage

can seldom see through his bars of rage

his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing

the caged bird sings with a fearful trill

of things unknown but longed for still

and his tune is heard on the distant hill

for the caged bird sings of freedom

the free bird thinks of another breeze

and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees

and the fat worms waiting on a dawnbright lawn and he names the sky his own

but a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams

his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream

his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing

the caged bird sings with a fearful trill

of things unknown but longed for still

and his tune is heard on the distant hill

for the caged bird sings of freedom

the more loving one

looking up at the stars i know quite well

that for all they care i can go to hell

but on earth indifference is the least

we have to dread from man or beast

how should we like it were stars to burn

with a passion for us we could not return

if equal affection cannot be

let the more loving one be me

admirer as i think i am

of stars that do not give a damn

i cannot now i see them say

i missed one terribly all day

were all stars to disappear or die

i should learn to look at an empty sky

and feel its total dark sublime

though this might take me a little time

how happy is the little stone

that rambles in the road alone

and doesnt care about careers

and exigencies never fears

and independent as the sun

associates or glows alone

what if you slept

and what if

in your sleep

you dreamed

and what if

in your dream

you went to heaven

and there plucked a strange and beautiful flower

and what if

when you awoke

you had that flower in you hand

ah what then

i would define in brief the poetry of words as the rhythmical creation of beauty

the moving finger writes and having writ

moves on nor all thy piety nor wit

shall lure it back to cancel half a line

nor all thy tears wash out a word of it

you fit into me

like a hook into an eye

an open eye

i would love to say

that you

weak in the knees

but

to be quite upfront

and completely

you

make my body

it has knees

at all

once in a golden hour

i cast to earth a seed

up there came a flower

the people said a weed

a poet is before anything else a person who is passionately in love with language

what lips my lips have kissed and where and why

i have forgotten and what arms have lain

under my head till morning but the rain

is full of ghosts tonight that tap and sigh

upon the glass and listen for reply

and in my heart there stirs a quiet pain

for unremembered lads that not again

will turn to me at midnight with a cry

thus in the winter stands the lonely tree

nor knows what birds have vanished one by one

yet knows its boughs more silent than before

i cannot say what loves have come and gone

i only know that summer sang in me

a little while that in me sings no more

my imagination makes me human and makes me a fool it gives me all the world and exiles me from it

you who never arrived

in my arms beloved who were lost

from the start

i dont even know what songs

would please you i have given up trying

to recognize you in the surging wave of

the next moment all the immense

images in me  the faroff deeplyfelt landscape

cities towers and bridges and un

suspected turns in the path

and those powerful lands that were once

pulsing with the life of the gods

all rise within me to mean

you who forever elude me

you beloved who are all

the gardens i have ever gazed at

longing an open window

in a country house  and you almost

stepped out pensive to meet me streets that i chanced

you had just walked down them and vanished

and sometimes in a shop the mirrors

were still dizzy with your presence and startled gave back

my toosudden image who knows perhaps the same

bird echoed through both of us

yesterday separate in the evening

why man he doth bestride the narrow world

like a colossus and we petty men

walk under his huge legs and peep about

to find ourselves dishonourable graves

i hunger for your sleek laugh and your hands the color of a furious harvest i want to eat the sunbeams flaring in your beauty

we unaccustomed to courage

exiles from delight

until love leaves its high holy temple

and comes into our sight

to liberate us into life

and in its train come ecstasies

yet if we are bold

love strikes away the chains of fear

from our souls

we are weaned from our timidity

in the flush of loves light

we dare be brave

and suddenly we see

that love costs all we are

and will ever be

yet it is only love

which sets us free

i crave your mouth your voice your hair

silent and starving i prowl through the streets

bread does not nourish me dawn disrupts me all day

i hunt for the liquid measure of your steps

i give you this to take with you

nothing remains as it was if you know this you can

begin again with pure joy in the uprooting

one is always the watcher

one the dancer

what can be explained is not poetry

you shall love your crooked neighbour with your crooked heart

she was a beautiful dreamer the kind of girl who kept her head in the clouds loved above the stars and left regret beneath the earth she walked on

in the desert

in the desert

i saw a creature naked bestial

who squatting upon the ground

held his heart in his hands

and ate of it

i said is it good friend

it is bitter—bitter he answered

but i like it

because it is bitter

and because it is my heart

poetry is the rhythmical creation of beauty in words

so dawn goes down today nothing gold can stay

i have outlasted all desire

my dreams and i have grown apart

my grief alone is left entire

the gleamings of an empty heart

the storms of ruthless dispensation

have struck my flowery garland numb

i live in lonely desolation

and wonder when my end will come

by tardy winters whistling chill

a single leaf which has outlasted

its season will be trembling still

you are never too old to become younger

love after love

the time will come

when with elation

you will greet yourself arriving

at your own door in your own mirror

and each will smile at the others welcome

and say sit here eat

you will love again the stranger who was your self

give wine give bread give back your heart

to itself to the stranger who has loved you

all your life whom you ignored

for another who knows you by heart

take down the love letters from the bookshelf

the photographs the desperate notes

peel your own image from the mirror

sit feast on your life

the poet with his face in his hands

you want to cry aloud for your

mistakes but to tell the truth the world

doesn’t need anymore of that sound

so if you’re going to do it and can’t

stop yourself if your pretty mouth can’t

hold it in at least go by yourself across

the forty fields and the forty dark inclines

of rocks and water to the place where

the falls are flinging out their white sheets

like crazy and there is a cave behind all that

jubilation and water fun and you can

stand there under it and roar all you

want and nothing will be disturbed you can

drip with despair all afternoon and still

on a green branch its wings just lightly touched

by the passing foil of the water the thrush

puffing out its spotted breast will sing

of the perfect stonehard beauty of everything

stop all the clocks cut off the telephone

prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone

silence the pianos and with muffled drum

bring out the coffin let the mourners come

scribbling on the sky the message he is dead

put crêpe bows round the white necks of the public doves

let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves

he was my north my south my east and west

my working week and my sunday rest

my noon my midnight my talk my song

i thought that love would last for ever i was wrong

the stars are not wanted now put out every one

pack up the moon and dismantle the sun

pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood

for nothing now can ever come to any good

like a sculptor if necessary

carve a friend out of stone

realize that your inner sight is blind

and try to see a treasure in everyone

that night when you kissed me i left a poem in your mouth and you can hear some of the lines every time you breathe out

the words ‘i love you’ kill and resurrect millions in less than a second

ah love let us be true

to one another for the world which seems

to lie before us like a land of dreams

so various so beautiful so new

hath really neither joy nor love nor light

nor certitude nor peace nor help for pain

and we are here as on a darkling plain

swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight

where ignorant armies clash by night

you remember too much

my mother said to me recently

why hold onto all that and i said

where can i put it down

a man said to the universe

a man said to the universe

however replied the universe

the fact has not created in me

beauty is truth truth beauty—that is all

ye know on earth and all ye need to know

all this time

i drank you like the cure when maybe

you were the poison

life is but a day

a fragile dewdrop on its perilous way

from a tree’s summit

heard melodies are sweet but those unheard

are sweeter therefore ye soft pipes play on

you are

i love you because no two snowflakes are alike and it is possible if you stand tippytoe to walk between the raindrops

there is no frigate like a book

nor any coursers like a page

this traverse may the poorest take

how frugal is the chariot

that bears a human soul

i am vertical

but i would rather be horizontal

i am not a tree with my root in the soil

sucking up minerals and motherly love

so that each march i may gleam into leaf

nor am i the beauty of a garden bed

attracting my share of ahs and spectacularly painted

compared with me a tree is immortal

and a flowerhead not tall but more startling

and i want the ones longevity and the others daring

tonight in the infinitesimal light of the stars

the trees and flowers have been strewing their cool odors

i walk among them but none of them are noticing

sometimes i think that when i am sleeping

i must most perfectly resemble them

it is more natural to me lying down

then the sky and i are in open conversation

and i shall be useful when i lie down finally

the the trees may touch me for once and the flowers have time for me

i am vertical  march

to elevate the soul poetry is necessary

five minutes are enough to dream a whole life that is how relative time is

after all my erstwhile dear

my no longer cherished

need we say it was not love

just because it perished

you will hear thunder and remember me

and think she wanted storms the rim

of the sky will be the colour of hard crimson

and your heart as it was then will be on fire

o may i join the choir invisible

of those immortal dead who live again

in minds made better by their presence live

in pulses stirred to generosity

sometimes i sit alone under the stars and think of the galaxies inside my heart and truly wonder if anyone will ever want to make sense of all that i am

nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals

the power of your intense fragilitywhose texture

compels me with the colour of its countries

rendering death and forever with each breathing

i do not know what it is about you that closes

and opensonly something in me understands

the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses

nobodynot even the rain has such small hands

excerpt of  from  selected poems

twice i have lived forever in a smile

the saddest thing is to be

a minute to someone

when youve made them your eternity

it’s the fire in my eyes

and the flash of my teeth

the swing in my waist

and the joy in my feet

i’m a woman

we are the hollow men

we are the stuffed men

headpiece filled with straw alas

our dried voices when

we whisper together

are quiet and meaningless

as wind in dry grass

or rats feet over broken glass

in our dry cellar

whereas story is processed in the mind in a straightforward manner poetry bypasses rational thought and goes straight to the limbic system and lights it up like a brushfire its the crack cocaine of the literary world

time for you and time for me

and time yet for a hundred indecisions

and for a hundred visions and revisions

before the taking of a toast and tea

to be great be whole

exclude nothing exaggerate nothing that is not you

be whole in everything put all you are

into the smallest thing you do

so in each lake the moon shines with splendor

because it blooms up above

you have been told that even like a chain you are as weak as your weakest link

this is but half the truth

you are also as strong as your strongest link

to measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of the ocean

by the frailty of its foam

to judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconstancy

poetry is a lifecherishing force for poems are not words after all but fires for the cold ropes let down to the lost something as necessary as bread in the pockets of the hungry

out beyond ideas of wrongdoing

and rightdoing there is a field

ill meet you there

before you know what kindness really is

you must lose things

feel the future dissolve in a moment

what you held in your hand

what you counted and carefully saved

all this must go so you know

how desolate the landscape can be

between the regions of kindness

how you ride and ride

thinking the bus will never stop

the passengers eating maize and chicken

will stare out the window forever

before you learn the tender gravity of kindness

you must travel where the indian in a white poncho

lies dead by the side of the road

you must see how this could be you

how he too was someone

who journeyed through the night with plans

and the simple breath that kept him alive

before you know kindness as the deepest thing

you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing

you must wake up with sorrow

you must speak to it till your voice

catches the thread of all sorrows

and you see the size of the cloth

then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore

only kindness that ties your shoes

and sends you out into the day to mail letters and

only kindness that raises its head

from the crowd of the world to say

it is i you have been looking for

and then goes with you everywhere

like a shadow or a friend

we ran as if to meet the moon

i go down to the shore

i go down to the shore in the morning

and depending on the hour the waves

are rolling in or moving out

and i say oh i am miserable

what shall—

what should i do and the sea says

in its lovely voice

excuse me i have work to do

i have named you queen

there are taller than you taller

there are purer than you purer

there are lovelier than you lovelier

but you are the queen

when you go through the streets

no one recognizes you

no one sees your crystal crown no one looks

at the carpet of red gold

that you tread as you pass

the nonexistent carpet

and when you appear

all the rivers sound

in my body bells

shake the sky

and a hymn fills the world

only you and i

only you and i my love

listen to it

love which quickly arrests the gentle heart

seized him with my beautiful form

that was taken from me in a manner which still grieves me

love which pardons no beloved from loving

took me so strongly with delight in him

that as you see it still abandons me not

looks like what drives me crazy

dont have no effect on you

but im gonna keep on at it

till it drives you crazy too

oh phosphorescence now there’s a word to lift your hat to to find that phosphorescence that light within — is the genius behind poetry

for darkness restores what light cannot repair

if you want me again look for me under your bootsoles

only my books anoint me

and a few friends

those who reach into my veins

i found god in myself

and i loved her

one need not be a chamber to be haunted

the glory of christianity is to conquer by forgiveness

if you love me henry you don’t love me in a way i understand

frida kahlo to marty mcconnell

leaving is not enough you must

stay gone train your heart

like a dog change the locks

even on the house he’s never

visited you lucky lucky girl

you have an apartment

just your size a bathtub

full of tea a heart the size

of arizona but not nearly

so arid don’t wish away

your cracked past your

crooked toes your problems

are papier mache puppets

you made or bought because the vendor

at the market was so compelling you just

had to have them you had to have him

and you did and now you pull down

the bridge between your houses

you make him call before

he visits you take a lover

for granted you take

a lover who looks at you

like maybe you are magic make

the first bottle you consume

in this place a relic place it

on whatever altar you fashion

with a knife and five cranberries

don’t lose too much weight

stupid girls are always trying

to disappear as revenge and you

are not stupid you loved a man

with more hands than a parade

of beggars and here you stand heart

heart leaking something so strong

they can smell it in the street

no’ might make them angry but it will make you free

the old astronomer to his pupil

reach me down my tycho brahe i would know him when we meet

when i share my later science sitting humbly at his feet

he may know the law of all things yet be ignorant of how

we are working to completion working on from then to now

pray remember that i leave you all my theory complete

lacking only certain data for your adding as is meet

and remember men will scorn it tis original and true

and the obloquy of newness may fall bitterly on you

but my pupil as my pupil you have learned the worth of scorn

you have laughed with me at pity we have joyed to be forlorn

what for us are all distractions of mens fellowship and smiles

what for us the goddess pleasure with her meretricious smiles

you may tell that german college that their honor comes too late

but they must not waste repentance on the grizzly savants fate

though my soul may set in darkness it will rise in perfect light

i have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night

what my boy you are not weeping you should save your eyes for sight

you will need them mine observer yet for many another night

i leave none but you my pupil unto whom my plans are known

you have none but me you murmur and i leave you quite alone

well then kiss me  since my mother left her blessing on my brow

there has been a something wanting in my nature until now

i can dimly comprehend it  that i might have been more kind

might have cherished you more wisely as the one i leave behind

i have never failed in kindness no we lived too high for strife

calmest coldness was the error which has crept into our life

but your spirit is untainted i can dedicate you still

to the service of our science you will further it you will

there are certain calculations i should like to make with you

to be sure that your deductions will be logical and true

and remember patience patience is the watchword of a sage

not today nor yet tomorrow can complete a perfect age

i have sown like tycho brahe that a greater man may reap

but if none should do my reaping twill disturb me in my sleep

so be careful and be faithful though like me you leave no name

see my boy that nothing turn you to the mere pursuit of fame

i must say goodbye my pupil for i cannot longer speak

draw the curtain back for venus ere my vision grows too weak

it is strange the pearly planet should look red as fiery mars

god will mercifully guide me on my way amongst the stars

i haven’t been very impressed lately

by people

or places

or the way someone said he loved me and then slowly changed his mind

i am terrified by this dark thing

that sleeps in me

all day i feel its soft feathery turnings its malignity

a truth should exist

it should not be used

like this if i love you

is that a fact or a weapon

it is always fatal to have music or poetry interrupted

so many days oh so many days

seeing you so tangible and so close

how do i pay with what do i pay

the bloodthirsty spring

has awakened in the woods

the foxes start from their earths

the serpents drink the dew

and i go with you in the leaves

between the pines and the silence

asking myself how and when

i will have to pay for my luck

of everything i have seen

its you i want to go on seeing

of everything ive touched

its your flesh i want to go on touching

i love your orange laughter

i am moved by the sight of you sleeping

what am i to do love loved one

i dont know how others love

or how people loved in the past

i live watching you loving you

being in love is my nature

you please me more each afternoon

where is she i keep on asking

if your eyes disappear

how long shes taking i think and im hurt

i feel poor foolish and sad

and you arrive and you are lightning

glancing off the peach trees

thats why i love you and yet not why

there are so many reasons and yet so few

for love has to be so

involving and general

particular and terrifying

joyful and grieving

flowering like the stars

and measureless as a kiss

thats why i love you and yet not why

there are so many reasons and yet so few

for love has to be so

involving and general

particular and terrifying

joyful and grieving

flowering like the stars

and measureless as a kiss

if we surrendered

to earths intelligence

we could rise up rooted like trees

inside this violent world

where they make transactions

with beauty

the days arent discarded or collected they are bees

that burned with sweetness or maddened

the sting the struggle continues

the journeys go and come between honey and pain

no the net of years doesnt unweave there is no net

they dont fall drop by drop from a river there is no river

sleep doesnt divide life into halves

or action or silence or honor

life is like a stone a single motion

a lonesome bonfire reflected on the leaves

an arrow only one slow or swift a metal

that climbs or descends burning in your bones

go wisely and slowly those who rush stumble and fall

no man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge

the teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple among his followers gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness

if he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind

out of the quarrel with others we make rhetoric out of the quarrel with ourselves we make poetry

stopping by woods on a snowy evening

whose woods these are i think i know

his house is in the village though

he will not see me stopping here

to watch his woods fill up with snow

my little horse must think it queer

to stop without a farmhouse near

between the woods and frozen lake

the darkest evening of the year

he gives his harness bells a shake

to ask if there is some mistake

the only other sounds the sweep

of easy wind and downy flake

the woods are lovely dark and deep

but i have promises to keep

and miles to go before i sleep

and miles to go before i sleep

what happens to a dream deferred

does it dry up

like a raisin in the sun

or fester like a sore

and then run

does it stink like rotten meat

or crust and sugar over

maybe it just sags

or does it explode

when i am dead my dearest

when i am dead my dearest

sing no sad songs for me

plant thou no roses at my head

nor shady cypresstree

be the green grass above me

with showers and dewdrops wet

and if thou wilt remember

and if thou wilt forget

i shall not see the shadows

i shall not feel the rain

i shall not hear the nightingale

sing on as if in pain

and dreaming through the twilight

that doth not rise nor set

and haply may forget

i will soothe you and heal you

i will bring you roses

i too have been covered with thorns

to hear neverheard sounds

to see neverseen colors and shapes

to try to understand the imperceptible

power pervading the world

to fly and find pure ethereal substances

that are not of matter

but of that invisible soul pervading reality

to hear another soul and to whisper to another soul

to be a lantern in the darkness

or an umbrella in a stormy day

to feel much more than know

to be the eyes of an eagle slope of a mountain

to be a wave understanding the influence of the moon

to be a tree and read the memory of the leaves

to be an insignificant pedestrian on the streets

of crazy cities watching watching and watching

to be a smile on the face of a woman

and shine in her memory

as a moment saved without planning

why cant you see im a kid said the kid

why try to make me like you

why are you hurt when i dont cuddle

why do you sigh when i splash through a puddle

why do you scream when i do what i did

listen real poetry doesnt say anything it just ticks off the possibilities opens all doors you can walk through anyone that suits you

i too am not a bit tamed i too am untranslatable

i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world

to hide feelings when you are near crying is the secret of dignity

my mouth is a fire escape

the words coming out

don’t care that they are naked

there is something burning in there

your daughter is ugly

she knows loss intimately

carries whole cities in her belly

as a child relatives wouldn’t hold her

she was splintered wood and sea water

they said she reminded them of the war

on her fifteenth birthday you taught her

how to tie her hair like rope

and smoke it over burning frankincense

you made her gargle rosewater

and while she coughed said

macaanto girls like you shouldn’t smell

of lonely or empty

you are her mother

why did you not warn her

hold her like a rotting boat

and tell her that men will not love her

if she is covered in continents

if her teeth are small colonies

if her stomach is an island

if her thighs are borders

what man wants to lay down

and watch the world burn

in his bedroom

your daughter’s face is a small riot

her hands are a civil war

a refugee camp behind each ear

a body littered with ugly things

but god

doesn’t she wear

the world well

i am two fools i know

for loving and for saying so

repeat after me

you owe

no one

your forgiveness

except maybe yourself

i opened a book and in i strode

now nobody can find me

ive left my chair my house my road

my town and my world behind me

im wearing the cloak ive slipped on the ring

ive swallowed the magic potion

ive fought with a dragon dined with a king

and dived in a bottomless ocean

i opened a book and made some friends

i shared their tears and laughter

and followed their road with its bumps and bends

to the happily ever after

i finished my book and out i came

the cloak can no longer hide me

my chair and my house are just the same

but i have a book inside me

i do not know what it is about you that closes

and opensonly something in me understands

the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses

death is the easy part the hard part is living and knowing you could be so much more then you’re willing to be

the sound of the wind

i have done it again

i manage it

a sort of walking miracle my skin

bright as a nazi lampshade

my right foot

my face a featureless fine

peel off the napkin

o my enemy

do i terrify

the nose the eye pits the full set of teeth

the sour breath

will vanish in a day

soon soon the flesh

the grave cave ate will be

at home on me

and i a smiling woman

i am only thirty

and like the cat i have nine times to die

this is number three

what a trash

to annihilate each decade

what a million filaments

the peanutcrunching crowd

shoves in to see

them unwrap me hand and foot

the big strip tease

these are my hands

my knees

i may be skin and bone

nevertheless i am the same identical woman

the first time it happened i was ten

it was an accident

the second time i meant

to last it out and not come back at all

as a seashell

they had to call and call

and pick the worms off me like sticky pearls

is an art like everything else

i do it exceptionally well

i do it so it feels like hell

i do it so it feels real

i guess you could say ive a call

its easy enough to do it in a cell

its easy enough to do it and stay put

its the theatrical

to the same place the same face the same brute

that knocks me out

there is a charge

for the eyeing of my scars there is a charge

for the hearing of my heart

it really goes

and there is a charge a very large charge

for a word or a touch

or a bit of blood

or a piece of my hair or my clothes

so so herr doktor

so herr enemy

i am your opus

i am your valuable

the pure gold baby

that melts to a shriek

i turn and burn

do not think i underestimate your great concern

you poke and stir

flesh bone there is nothing there

out of the ash

i rise with my red hair

all the worlds a stage

and all the men and women merely players

they have their exits and their entrances

and one man in his time plays many parts

his acts being seven ages at first the infant

mewling and puking in the nurses arms

then the whining schoolboy with his satchel

and shining morning face creeping like snail

unwillingly to school and then the lover

sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad

made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier

full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard

jealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel

seeking the bubble reputation

even in the cannons mouth and then the justice

in fair round belly with good capon lined

with eyes severe and beard of formal cut

full of wise saws and modern instances

and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts

into the lean and slippered pantaloon

with spectacles on nose and pouch on side

his youthful hose well saved a world too wide

for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice

turning again toward childish treble pipes

and whistles in his sound last scene of all

that ends this strange eventful history

is second childishness and mere oblivion

so for now

i will miss you like i’ll never see you again

and the next time i see you

i will kiss you like i’ll never kiss you again

and when i fall asleep beside you

i will fall asleep as if i’ll never wake up again

because i don’t know if i will

i don’t know if i will

i will love you like the world is ending

turning and turning in the widening gyre

the falcon cannot hear the falconer

things fall apart the centre cannot hold

mere anarchy is loosed upon the world

the blooddimmed tide is loosed and everywhere

the ceremony of innocence is drowned

the best lack all conviction while the worst

are full of passionate intensity

my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun

coral is far more red than her lips red

if snow be white why then her breasts are dun

if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head

i have seen roses damaskd red and white

but no such roses see i in her cheeks

and in some perfumes is there more delight

than in the breath that from my mistress reeks

i love to hear her speak yet well i know

that music hath a far more pleasing sound

i grant i never saw a goddess go

my mistress when she walks treads on the ground

and yet by heaven i think my love as rare

as any she belied with false compare

theres an old saying that applies to me you cant lose a game if you dont play the game act  scene

i live not in dreams but in contemplation of a reality that is perhaps the future

it seems to me now that the plain state of being human is dramatic enough for anyone you dont need to be a heroin addict or a performance poet to experience extremity you just have to love someone

hope is the thing with feathers

that perches in the soul

and sings the tune without the words

and never stops at all

and sweetest in the gale is heard

and sore must be the storm

that could abash the little bird

that kept so many warm

ive heard it in the chilliest land

and on the strangest sea

it asked a crumb of me

poems are a hotline to our hearts and we forget this emotional power at our peril

dont worry be happy

how many loved your moments of glad grace

and loved your beauty with love false or true

but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you

and loved the sorrows of your changing face

a fragment for my friend

if your soul left this earth i would follow and find you

silent my starship suspended in night

he that is thy friend indeed

he will help thee in thy need

if thou sorrow he will weep

if thou wake he cannot sleep

he with thee doth bear a part

these are certain signs to know

faithful friend from flattering foe

we would rather be ruined than changed

we would rather die in our dread

than climb the cross of the moment

and let our illusions die

some girls are full of heartache and poetry and those are the kind of girls who try to save wolves instead of running away from them

a little learning is a dangerous thing

drink deep or taste not the pierian spring

there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain

and drinking largely sobers us again

a flower knows when its butterfly will return

and if the moon walks out the sky will understand

but now it hurts to watch you leave so soon

when i dont know if you will ever come back

i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy

of a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what is

strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i

am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away

the way a crow

shook down on me

the dust of snow

from a hemlock tree

has given my heart

and saved some part

of a day i had rued

we are made of all those who have built and broken us

say not i have found the truth but rather i have found a truth

say not i have found the path of the soul say rather i have met the soul walking upon my path

for the soul walks upon all paths

the soul walks not upon a line neither does it grow like a reed

the soul unfolds itself like a lotus of countless petals

each star is a mirror reflecting the truth inside you

sometimes the most beautiful people are beautifully broken

a poem begins with a lump in the throat a homesickness or a love sickness it is a reachingout toward expression an effort to find fulfillment a complete poem is one where an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found words

the monsters were never

under my bed

because the monsters

were inside my head

i fear no monsters

for no monsters i see

because all this time

the monster has been me

maybe you could be mine  or maybe we’ll be entwined  aimless in this sexless foreplay

sometimes the notes are ferocious

skirmishes against the author

raging along the borders of every page

if i could just get my hands on you

kierkegaard or conor cruise obrien

they seem to say

i would bolt the door and beat some logic into your head

other comments are more offhand dismissive

that kind of thing

i remember once looking up from my reading

my thumb as a bookmark

trying to imagine what the person must look like

who wrote dont be a ninny

alongside a paragraph in the life of emily dickinson

students are more modest

needing to leave only their splayed footprints

along the shore of the page

one scrawls metaphor next to a stanza of eliots

another notes the presence of irony

fifty times outside the paragraphs of a modest proposal

or they are fans who cheer from the empty bleachers

hands cupped around their mouths

absolutely they shout

to duns scotus and james baldwin

yes bullseye my man

check marks asterisks and exclamation points

rain down along the sidelines

and if you have managed to graduate from college

in a margin perhaps now

is the time to take one step forward

we have all seized the white perimeter as our own

and reached for a pen if only to show

we did not just laze in an armchair turning pages

we pressed a thought into the wayside

planted an impression along the verge

even irish monks in their cold scriptoria

jotted along the borders of the gospels

brief asides about the pains of copying

a bird singing near their window

or the sunlight that illuminated their page

anonymous men catching a ride into the future

on a vessel more lasting than themselves

and you have not read joshua reynolds

they say until you have read him

enwreathed with blakes furious scribbling

yet the one i think of most often

the one that dangles from me like a locket

was written in the copy of catcher in the rye

i borrowed from the local library

i was just beginning high school then

reading books on a davenport in my parents living room

and i cannot tell you

how vastly my loneliness was deepened

how poignant and amplified the world before me seemed

when i found on one page

a few greasy looking smears

and next to them written in soft pencil

by a beautiful girl i could tell

whom i would never meet

pardon the egg salad stains but im in love

what though the radiance which was once so bright

be now for ever taken from my sight

though nothing can bring back the hour

of splendour in the grass of glory in the flower

we will grieve not rather find

strength in what remains behind

in the primal sympathy

which having been must ever be

in the soothing thoughts that spring

out of human suffering

in the faith that looks through death

in years that bring the philosophic mind

from childhoods hour i have not been

as others were i have not seen

as others saw i could not bring

my passions from a common spring

from the same source i have not taken

my sorrow i could not awaken

my heart to joy at the same tone

and all i loved i loved alone

then in my childhood in the dawn

of a most stormy life was drawn

from every depth of good and ill

the mystery which binds me still

from the torrent or the fountain

from the red cliff of the mountain

from the sun that round me rolled

in its autumn tint of gold

from the lightning in the sky

as it passed me flying by

from the thunder and the storm

and the cloud that took the form

when the rest of heaven was blue

of a demon in my view

love is not all

love is not all it is not meat nor drink

nor slumber nor a roof against the rain

nor yet a floating spar to men that sink

and rise and sink and rise and sink again

love can not fill the thickened lung with breath

nor clean the blood nor set the fractured bone

yet many a man is making friends with death

even as i speak for lack of love alone

it well may be that in a difficult hour

pinned down by pain and moaning for release

or nagged by want past resolution’s power

i might be driven to sell your love for peace

or trade the memory of this night for food

it well may be i do not think i would

you had this expression on your face like you weren’t quite sure you were supposed to be on earth

acquainted with the night

i have been one acquainted with the night

i have walked out in rain—and back in rain

i have outwalked the furthest city light

i have looked down the saddest city lane

i have passed by the watchman on his beat

and dropped my eyes unwilling to explain

i have stood still and stopped the sound of feet

when far away an interrupted cry

came over houses from another street

but not to call me back or say goodbye

and further still at an unearthly height

one luminary clock against the sky

proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right

i have been one acquainted with the night

if after i die people want to write my biography there is nothing simpler they only need two dates the date of my birth and the date of my death between one and another every day is mine

i feel it when i sorrow most

tis better to have loved and lost

than never to have loved at all

so sweet and delicious do i become

when i am in bed with a man

who i sense loves and enjoys me

that the pleasure i bring excels all delight

so the knot of love however tight

it seemed before is tied tighter still

i met a traveller from an antique land

who said two vast and trunkless legs of stone

stand in the desert near them on the sand

and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command

tell that its sculptor well those passions read

which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things

the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed

and on the pedestal these words appear

my name is ozymandias king of kings

look on my works ye mighty and despair

nothing beside remains round the decay

of that colossal wreck boundless and bare

the lone and level sands stretch far away

this is just to say

the plums

that were in

the icebox

and which

you were probably

they were delicious

so sweet

and so cold

a poets work    to name the unnamable to point at frauds to take sides start arguments shape the world and stop it from going to sleep

they hail you as their morning star

because you are the way you are

if you return the sentiment

theyll try to make you different

and once they have you safe and sound

they want to change you all around

your moods and ways they put a curse on

theyd make of you another person

they cannot let you go your gait

they influence and educate

theyd alter all that they admired

they make me sick they make me tired

and you will always be alone

in love at first sight

but i will always believe

that the people

we love

we have loved before

many many many times before

and when we stumble

through grace and circumstance

and that brilliant illusion of choice

to finally meet them again

we feel it faster

each time through

the one glance

that set life alight

staring through the layers

of lifetimes and stolen glances

and first kisses and hands held

the brace against the weight

and unrelenting tide

in love at first sight

but am not burdened with the misconception

that its a first sight

at all

when man determined to destroy

himself he picked the was

of shall and finding only why

smashed it into because

whatever the imagination seizes as beauty must be truth whether it existed before or not

i want to be

in love with you

the same way

i am in

love with the moon

with the light

out of its soul

it is beautiful to express love and even more beautiful to feel it

regret is mostly caused by not having

i dream of lost vocabularies that might express some of what we no longer can

a poet should be so crafty with words that he is envied even for his pains

i am the shore and the ocean awaiting myself on both sides

after the first glass of vodka

you can accept just about anything

of life even your own mysteriousness

you think it is nice that a box

of matches is purple and brown and is called la petite and comes from sweden

with a chaste heart

with pure eyes i celebrate your beauty

holding the leash of blood

so that it might leap out and trace your outline

where you lie down in my ode

as in a land of forests or in surf

in aromatic loam or in sea music

equally beautiful your feet

arched by primeval tap of wind or sound

your ears small shells

of the splendid american sea

your breasts of level plentitude

fulfilled by living light

your flying eyelids of wheat

revealing or enclosing

the two deep countries of your eyes

the line your shoulders have divided into pale regions

loses itself and blends into the compact halves of an apple

continues separating your beauty down into two columns of

to sink into the two grapes of your feet

where your twin symmetrical tree burns again and rises

over the pact of sea and earth

from what materials

did your body come together

swelling like baking bread to signal silvered hills

the cleavage of one petal

until alone remained

the fine and firm feminine form

it is not only light that falls over the world spreading inside your body

yet suffocate itself

so much is clarity

taking its leave of you

as if you were on fire within

the moon lives in the lining of your skin

she conquered her demons and wore her scars like wings

love is a game

for the next x or o

a tamed woman will never leave her mark in the world

saints have no moderation nor do poets just exuberance

let your life lightly dance on the edges of

time like dew on the tip of a leaf

you darkness that i come from

i love you more than all the fires

that fence in the world

for the fire makes

a circle of light for everyone

and then no one outside learns of you

but the darkness pulls in everything

shapes and fires animals and myself

how easily it gathers them

powers and people

and it is possible a great energy

i have faith in nights

since the thing perhaps is

to eat flowers and not to be afraid

truth can never be told so as to be understood and not be believed

but i was young

and didn’t know better

and someone should have told me to capture every second

because now i’m sitting here alone and it’s getting really hard to breath because tears are growing in my throat and they want to break out but there are people

and i just want to be somewhere silent

but still i don’t want to be alone because i’m scared and lonely

and i don’t understand

because i was alone my whole life

my whole life

i was so damn lonely and i was content with that

because i liked myself and my own company

and i didn’t need anyone

but then there was you

so someone should have told me that love is for those few brave who can handle the unbearable emptiness

the unbearable guilt and lack of oneself

because i lost myself to someone i love

and i might get myself back one day

but it will take time it will take time

this is gonna take some time

i wish someone would have told me this

someone should have told me this

the quiet world

in an effort to get people to look

into each other’s eyes more

and also to appease the mutes

the government has decided

to allot each person exactly one hundred

and sixtyseven words per day

when the phone rings i put it to my ear

without saying hello in the restaurant

i am adjusting well to the new way

late at night i call my long distance lover

proudly say i only used fiftynine today

i saved the rest for you

when she doesn’t respond

i know she’s used up all her words

so i slowly whisper i love you

thirtytwo and a third times

after that we just sit on the line

and listen to each other breathe

to me the greatest pleasure of writing is not what its about but the music the words make

every poem should remind the reader that they are going to die

i really believe or want to believe really i am nuts otherwise ill never be sane

my heart is lost the beasts have eaten it

my battered heart will always be

where the ocean meets the sand i

will break over and over

every day that is the best and

their heart grew cold

they let their wings down

the type

everyone needs a place it shouldnt be inside of someone else richard siken

if you grow up the type of woman men want to look at

you can let them look at you but do not mistake eyes for hands

or windows

or mirrors

let them see what a woman looks like

they may not have ever seen one before

if you grow up the type of woman men want to touch

you can let them touch you

sometimes it is not you they are reaching for

sometimes it is a bottle a door a sandwich a pulitzer another woman

but their hands found you first do not mistake yourself for a guardian

or a muse or a promise or a victim or a snack

you are a woman skin and bones veins and nerves hair and sweat

you are not made of metaphors not apologies not excuses

if you grow up the type of woman men want to hold

you can let them hold you

all day they practice keeping their bodies upright

even after all this evolving it still feels unnatural still strains the muscles

holds firm the arms and spine only some men will want to learn

what it feels like to curl themselves into a question mark around you

admit they do not have the answers

they thought they would have by now

some men will want to hold you like the answer

you are not the answer

you are not the problem you are not the poem

or the punchline or the riddle or the joke

woman if you grow up the type men want to love

you can let them love you

being loved is not the same thing as loving

when you fall in love it is discovering the ocean

after years of puddle jumping it is realizing you have hands

it is reaching for the tightrope when the crowds have all gone home

do not spend time wondering if you are the type of woman

men will hurt if he leaves you with a car alarm heart you learn to sing along

it is hard to stop loving the ocean even after it has left you gasping salty

forgive yourself for the decisions you have made the ones you still call

mistakes when you tuck them in at night and know this

know you are the type of woman who is searching for a place to call yours

let the statues crumble

you have always been the place

you are a woman who can build it yourself

you were born to build

to write poetry and to commit suicide apparently so contradictory had really been the same attempts at escape

by night love tie your heart to mine and the two

together in their sleep will defeat the darkness

i am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground

so it is and so it will be for so it has been time out of mind

into the darkness they go the wise and the lovely crowned

with lilies and with laurel they go but i am not resigned

lovers and thinkers into the earth with you

be one with the dull the indiscriminate dust

a fragment of what you felt of what you knew

a formula a phrase remains—but the best is lost

the answers quick and keen the honest look the laughter the love—

they are gone they are gone to feed the roses elegant and curled

is the blossom fragrant is the blossom i know but i do not approve

more precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world

down down down into the darkness of the grave

gently they go the beautiful the tender the kind

quietly they go the intelligent the witty the brave

i know but i do not approve and i am not resigned

there have been so many times

i have seen a man wanting to weep

but

beat his heart until it was unconscious

her skin is white cloth

and shes all sewn apart

and she has many colored pins

sticking out of her heart

she has many different zombies

who are deeply in her trance

she even has a zombie

who was originally from france

but she knows she has a curse on her

a curse she cannot win

for if someone gets

too close to her

the pins stick farther in

i am deliberate and afraid of nothing

and in despair i bowed my head

there is no peace on earth i said

for hate is strong

and mocks the song

of peace on earth goodwill to men

then pealed the bells more loud and deep

god is not dead nor doth he sleep

the wrong shall fail

the right prevail

with peace on earth goodwill to men

i am the poet of the poor because i was poor when i loved since i could not give gifts i gave words

was not writing poetry a secret transaction a voice answering a voice

it is difficult

to get the news from poems

of what is found there

the difference between the poet and the mathematician is that the poet tries to get his head into the heavens while the mathematician tries to get the heavens into his head

poetry is a naked woman a naked man and the distance between them

iii the last time i tried to scream i felt my father climbing up through my throat and into my mouth

v i think he must have conferenced with my nightmares on exactly how to hurt me

vi he never broke my heart he only turned it into a compass that always points me back to him

a billion stars go spinning through the night

glittering above your head

but in you is the presence that will be

when all the stars are dead

you once told me

you wanted to find

yourself in the world

and i told you to

to discover the world

within you

you once told me

you wanted to save

the world from all its wars

and i told you to

first save yourself

from the world

and all the wars

you put yourself

through

apply within by suzy kassem

the best kind of humans are the ones who stay

there is darkness in light there is pain in joy and there are thorns on the rose

and all the boards did shrink

nor any drop to drink

we sit and talk

quietly with long lapses of silence

and i am aware of the stream

that has no language coursing

beneath the quiet heaven of

your eyes

which has no speech

nobody wanted your dance

nobody wanted your strange glitter your floundering

drowning life and your effort to save yourself

treading water dancing the dark turmoil

looking for something to give

speak against unconscious oppression

speak against the tyranny of the unimaginative

speak against bonds

time present and time past

are both perhaps present in time future

and time future contained in time past

look the trees

are turning

their own bodies

into pillars

are giving off the rich

and fulfillment

the long tapers

are bursting and floating away over

the blue shoulders

of the ponds

and every pond

no matter what its

nameless now

in my lifetime

leads back to this the fires

and the black river of loss

whose other side

none of us will ever know

to live in this world

you must be able

to do three things

to love what is mortal

to hold it

against your bones knowing

your own life depends on it

and when the time comes to let it go

to let it go

a poet is a man who manages in a lifetime of standing out in thunderstorms to be struck by lightning five or six times

here is the repeated image of the lover destroyed

sweet spring is your

time is my time is our

time for springtime is lovetime

and viva sweet love

all the merry little birds are

flying in the floating in the

very spirits singing in

are winging in the blossoming

lovers go and lovers come

but any two are perfectly

alone theres nobody else alive

such a sky and such a sun

i never knew and neither did you

and everybody never breathed

quite so many kinds of yes

not a tree can count his leaves

each herself by opening

but shining who by thousands mean

only one amazing thing

merry in the blossoming

always joyful selves are singing

sweet spring is your

time is my time is our

time for springtime is lovetime

and viva sweet love

sometimes to selfdiscover you must selfdestruct

i want to see thirst

in the syllables

in the sound

feel through the dark

for the scream

first of all nothing will happen

and a little later

nothing will happen again

poetry the best words in the best order

who says

they do not see color

this means

to them

you are invisible

i do not know which to prefer

the beauty of inflections

or the beauty of innuendos

the blackbird whistling

or just after

so i find words i never thought to speak

in streets i never thought i should revisit

when i left my body on a distant shore

i have gone out a possessed witch

haunting the black air braver at night

dreaming evil i have done my hitch

over the plain houses light by light

lonely thing twelvefingered out of mind

a woman like that is not a woman quite

i have been her kind

i have found the warm caves in the woods

filled them with skillets carvings shelves

fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves

whining rearranging the disaligned

a woman like that is misunderstood

i have been her kind

i have ridden in your cart driver

waved my nude arms at villages going by

learning the last bright routes survivor

where your flames still bite my thigh

and my ribs crack where your wheels wind

a woman like that is not ashamed to die

i have been her kind

poetry is nobody’s business except the poet’s and everybody else can fuck off

into my own

one of my wishes is that those dark trees

so old and firm they scarcely show the breeze

were not as ’twere the merest mask of gloom

but stretched away unto the edge of doom

i should not be withheld but that some day

into their vastness i should steal away

or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand

i do not see why i should e’er turn back

or those should not set forth upon my track

to overtake me who should miss me here

and long to know if still i held them dear

they would not find me changed from him they knew—

only more sure of all i thought was true

poets are shameless with their experiences they exploit them

beyond myself somewhere

i wait for my arrival

conscience is no more than the dead speaking to us

all shadows of clouds the sun cannot hide

like the moon cannot stop oceanic tide

but a hidden star can still be smiling

at nights black spell on darkness beguiling

my eyes are vague blue like the sky and change all the time they are indiscriminate but fleeting entirely specific and disloyal so that no one trusts me i am always looking away or again at something after it has given me up

poetry is not the most important thing in life id much rather lie in a hot bath reading agatha christie and sucking sweets

and he

each day is born with a sunrise

and ends in a sunset the same way we

open our eyes to see the light

and close them to hear the dark

you have no control over

how your story begins or ends

but by now you should know that

all things have an ending

every spark returns to darkness

every sound returns to silence

and every flower returns to sleep

with the earth

the journey of the sun

and moon is predictable

but yours

is your ultimate

fuck you poem

fuck you in slang and conventional english

fuck you in lost and neglected lingoes

fuck you hungry and sated faded pock marked and defaced

fuck you with orange rind fennel and anchovy paste

fuck you with rosemary and thyme and fried green olives on the side

fuck you humidly and icily

fuck you farsightedly and blindly

fuck you nude and draped in stolen finery

fuck you while cells divide wildly and birds trill

thank you for barring me from his bedside while he was ill

fuck you puce and chartreuse

fuck you postmodern and prehistoric

fuck you under the influence of opiun codeine laudanum and paregoric

fuck every real and imagined country you fancied yourself princess of

fuck you on feast days and fast days below and above

fuck you sleepless and shaking for nineteen nights running

fuck you ugly and fuck you stunning

fuck you shipwrecked on the barren island of your bed

fuck you marching in lockstep in the ranks of the dead

fuck you at low and high tide

and fuck you astride

anyone who has the bad luck to fuck you in dank hallways

bathrooms or kitchens

fuck you in gasps and whispered benedictions

and fuck these curses however heartfelt and true

that bind me till i forgive you to you

i want you to know

you know how this is

if i look

at the crystal moon at the red branch

of the slow autumn at my window

if i touch

near the fire

the impalpable ash

or the wrinkled body of the log

everything carries me to you

as if everything that exists

were little boats

that sail

toward those isles of yours that wait for me

well now

if little by little you stop loving me

i shall stop loving you little by little

if suddenly

you forget me

do not look for me

for i shall already have forgotten you

if you think it long and mad

the wind of banners

that passes through my life

and you decide

to leave me at the shore

of the heart where i have roots

that on that day

at that hour

i shall lift my arms

and my roots will set off

to seek another land

but

if each day

each hour

you feel that you are destined for me

with implacable sweetness

if each day a flower

climbs up to your lips to seek me

ah my love ah my own

in me all that fire is repeated

in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten

my love feeds on your love beloved

and as long as you live it will be in your arms

when i am feeling

all i have to do is

watch my cats

and my

bright star would i were steadfast as thou art—

not in lone splendour hung aloft the night

and watching with eternal lids apart

like natures patient sleepless eremite

the moving waters at their priestlike task

of pure ablution round earths human shores

or gazing on the new softfallen mask

of snow upon the mountains and the moors—

no—yet still stedfast still unchangeable

pillowd upon my fair loves ripening breast

to feel for ever its soft fall and swell

awake for ever in a sweet unrest

still still to hear her tendertaken breath

and so live ever—or else swoon to death

i think it’s beautiful

the way you sparkle

when you talk about

the things you love

somewhere along the way we all go a bit mad so burn let go and dive into the horror because maybe it’s the chaos which helps us find where we belong

i bring you with reverent hands

the books of my numberless dreams

and think not you can direct the course of love for love if it finds you worthy directs your course

the magic that occurs

when you give a person

to just be themselves

i need a spare heart to feel

all the things i feel

some days i wake up

and all i feel

are the fractures

in the flesh

that covers

the only me

ive ever known

some days

its those exact

that let the light

pour out

and cover

that found enough beauty

in the cracks

to stand

never cry because you have mountains of problem in your hands to solve always smile because each problems will someday resolve

laugh and the world laughs with you

weep and you weep alone

for the sad old earth must borrow its mirth

but has trouble enough of its own

once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary

over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore —

while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping

as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door

tell me not in mournful numbers

life is but an empty dream

for the soul is dead that slumbers

and things are not what they seem

and the grave is not its goal

dust thou are to dust thou returnest

was not spoken of the soul

not enjoyment and not sorrow

is our destined end or way

but to act that each tomorrow

find us farther than today

art is long and time is fleeting

and our hearts though stout and brave

still like muffled drums are beating

funeral marches to the grave

in the worlds broad field of battle

in the bivouac of life

be not like dumb driven cattle

be a hero in the strife

let the dead past bury its dead

act  act in the living present

heart within and god oerhead

we can make our lives sublime

and departing leave behind us

on the sand of time

footprints that perhaps another

sailing oer lifes solenm main

a forlorn and shipwrecked brother

seeing shall take heart again

let us then be up and doing

with a heart for any fate

learn to labor and to wait

the world is holy the soul is holy the skin is holy

wise wretch with pleasures too refined to please

with too much spirit to be eer at ease

with too much quickness ever to be taught

with too much thinking to have common thought

you purchase pain with all that joy can give

and die of nothing but a rage to live

we swallowed the chaos because we knew we didnt want to be ordinary

there isnt enough of anything

as long as we live but at intervals

a sweetness appears and given a chance

no one has imagined us we want to live like trees

sycamores blazing through the sulfuric air

dappled with scars still exuberantly budding

our animal passion rooted in the city

i know what my heart is like

since your love died

it is like a hollow ledge

left there by the tide

drying inward from the edge

i work all day and get halfdrunk at night

waking at four to soundless dark i stare

in time the curtainedges will grow light

till then i see whats really always there

unresting death a whole day nearer now

making all thought impossible but how

and where and when i shall myself die

arid interrogation yet the dread

of dying and being dead

flashes afresh to hold and horrify

the mind blanks at the glare not in remorse

the good not done the love not given time

torn off unused  nor wretchedly because

an only life can take so long to climb

clear of its wrong beginnings and may never

but at the total emptiness for ever

the sure extinction that we travel to

and shall be lost in always not to be here

not to be anywhere

and soon nothing more terrible nothing more true

this is a special way of being afraid

no trick dispels religion used to try

that vast motheaten musical brocade

created to pretend we never die

and specious stuff that says no rational being

can fear a thing it will not feel not seeing

that this is what we fear  no sight no sound

no touch or taste or smell nothing to think with

nothing to love or link with

the anasthetic from which none come round

and so it stays just on the edge of vision

that slows each impulse down to indecision

most things may never happen this one will

and realisation of it rages out

in furnacefear when we are caught without

people or drink courage is no good

it means not scaring others being brave

lets no one off the grave

death is no different whined at than withstood

slowly light strengthens and the room takes shape

it stands plain as a wardrobe what we know

have always known know that we cant escape

yet cant accept one side will have to go

meanwhile telephones crouch getting ready to ring

in lockedup offices and all the uncaring

intricate rented world begins to rouse

the sky is white as clay with no sun

work has to be done

postmen like doctors go from house to house

the times literary supplement december

i swear i end up feeling empty like youve taken something out of me and i have to search my body for scars

i am the least difficult of men all i want is boundless love

i never dreamed the sea so deep

the earth so dark so long my sleep

i wake to see the world go wild

the worst thing he told me

is bitterness people end up so

hope springs eternal in the human breast

man never is but always to be blest

the soul uneasy and confind from home

rests and expatiates in a life to come

i slave at filthy work that might

be done by any bookdrunk freak

this goes on until i kick the bucket

fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it

she was a phantom of delight

she was a phantom of delight

when first she gleamd upon my sight

to be a moments ornament

her eyes as stars of twilight fair

like twilights too her dusky hair

but all things else about her drawn

from maytime and the cheerful dawn

a dancing shape an image gay

to haunt to startle and waylay

a spirit yet a woman too

her household motions light and free

and steps of virgin liberty

a countenance in which did meet

sweet records promises as sweet

a creature not too bright or good

for human natures daily food

praise blame love kisses tears and smiles

and now i see with eye serene

the very pulse of the machine

a being breathing thoughtful breath

a traveller between life and death

the reason firm the temperate will

endurance foresight strength and skill

a perfect woman nobly plannd

to warn to comfort and command

and yet a spirit still and bright

with something of an angel light

the poet therefore is truly the thief of fire

nature never did betray

the heart that loved her

i sit in one of the dives

uncertain and afraid

as the clever hopes expire

waves of anger and fear

circulate over the bright

and darkened lands of the earth

obsessing our private lives

the unmentionable odour of death

offends the september night

accurate scholarship can

unearth the whole offence

from luther until now

that has driven a culture mad

find what occurred at linz

what huge imago made

i and the public know

what all schoolchildren learn

those to whom evil is done

do evil in return

all that a speech can say

about democracy

and what dictators do

the elderly rubbish they talk

to an apathetic grave

analysed all in his book

the enlightenment driven away

the habitforming pain

mismanagement and grief

we must suffer them all again

into this neutral air

where blind skyscrapers use

their full height to proclaim

the strength of collective man

each language pours its vain

but who can live for long

in an euphoric dream

out of the mirror they stare

imperialisms face

and the international wrong

faces along the bar

cling to their average day

the lights must never go out

the music must always play

all the conventions conspire

to make this fort assume

the furniture of home

lest we should see where we are

children afraid of the night

who have never been happy or good

the windiest militant trash

is not so crude as our wish

what mad nijinsky wrote

about diaghilev

is true of the normal heart

for the error bred in the bone

of each woman and each man

craves what it cannot have

not universal love

but to be loved alone

from the conservative dark

into the ethical life

the dense commuters come

repeating their morning vow

i will be true to the wife

ill concentrate more on my work

and helpless governors wake

to resume their compulsory game

who can release them now

who can reach the dead

who can speak for the dumb

all i have is a voice

to undo the folded lie

the romantic lie in the brain

of the sensual maninthestreet

and the lie of authority

whose buildings grope the sky

there is no such thing as the state

and no one exists alone

hunger allows no choice

to the citizen or the police

we must love one another or die

defenseless under the night

our world in stupor lies

flash out wherever the just

exchange their messages

may i composed like them

of eros and of dust

beleaguered by the same

negation and despair

show an affirming flame

we join spokes together in a wheel

but it is the center hole

that makes the wagon move

we shape clay into a pot

but it is the emptiness inside

that holds whatever we want

we hammer wood for a house

but it is the inner space

that makes it livable

we work with being

but nonbeing is what we use

the girl with many eyes

one day in the park

i had quite a surprise

i met a girl

who had many eyes

she was really quite pretty

and also quite shocking

and i noticed she had a mouth

so we ended up talking

we talked about flowers

and her poetry classes

and the problems shed have

if she ever wore glasses

its great to know a girl

who has so many eyes

but you really get wet

when she breaks down and cries

poetry puts starch in your backbone so you can stand so you can compose your life

with narrow probing eyes

i wonder if it weighs like mine

or has an easier size

i wonder if they bore it long

or did it just begin

i could not tell the date of mine

it feels so old a pain

i wonder if it hurts to live

and if they have to try

and whether could they choose between

it would not be to die

i note that some

at length renew their smile

an imitation of a light

that has so little oil

i wonder if when years have piled

some thousands  on the harm

of early hurt  if such a lapse

could give them any balm

or would they go on aching still

through centuries above

enlightened to a larger pain

by contrast with the love

the grieved are many

i am told

the reason deeper lies

death is but one

and comes but once

and only nails the eyes

theres grief of want

and grief of cold

a sort they call despair

theres banishment from native eyes

and though i may not guess the kind

correctly yet to me

a piercing comfort it affords

to note the fashions of the cross

and how theyre mostly worn

still fascinated to presume

that some are like my own

if i had a soul i sold it

if i had a body i used

it up spurting my essence

allen ginsberg warns you

dont follow my path

to extinction

t is not too late to seek a newer world

push off and sitting well in order smite

the sounding furrows for my purpose holds

to sail beyond the sunset and the baths

of all the western stars until i die

it may be that the gulfs will wash us down

it may be we shall touch the happy isles

and see the great achilles whom we knew

tho’ much is taken much abides and tho’

we are not now that strength which in old days

mov’d earth and heaven that which we are we are

made weak by time and fate but strong in will

to strive to seek to find and not to yield

when love beckons to you follow him

though his ways are hard and steep

and when his wings enfold you yield to him

though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you

and when he speaks to you believe in him

though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden

but if in your fear you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure

then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of

love’s threshingfloor

into the seasonless world where you shall laugh but not all of your laughter

and weep but not all of your tears

but if you love and must needs have desires let these be your desires

to melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night

to know the pain of too much tenderness

to be wounded by your own understanding of love

and to bleed willingly and joyfully

i know that i shall meet my fate somewhere among the clouds above those that i fight i do not hate those that i guard i do not love

mistress of mine own self

and mine own soul

im restless things are calling me away my hair is being pulled by the stars again

the purpose of poetry is to remind us

how difficult it is to remain just one person

for our house is open there are no keys in the doors

and invisible guests come in and out at will

what needs my shakespeare for his honoured bones

the labor of an age in pilèd stones

or that his hallowed relics should be hid

under a starypointing pyramid

what needst thou such weak witness of thy name

she was afraid of heights

but she was

much more afraid

if we must

both

be right

we will

each other

exercises are like prose whereas yoga is the poetry of movements once you understand the grammar of yoga you can write your poetry of movements

i died for beauty but was scarce

adjusted in the tomb

when one who died for truth was lain

in an adjoining room

he questioned softly why i failed

and i for truth—the two are one

we brethren are he said

and so as kinsmen met a night

we talked between the rooms

until the moss had reached our lips

and covered up our names

if you would hit the mark you must aim a little above it

every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth

when the immense drugged universe explodes

and leaves us gasping naked

this is no more than the ectasy of chaos

hold fast with both hands to that royal love

which alone as we know certainly restores

fragmentation into true being

to the sea to the sea the white gulls are crying

the wind is blowing and the white foam is flying

west west away the round sun is falling

grey ship grey ship do you hear them calling

the voices of my people that have gone before me

i will leave i will leave the woods that bore me

for our days are ending and our years failing

i will pass the wide waters lonely sailing

long are the waves on the last shore falling

sweet are the voices in the lost isle calling

in eressea in elvenhome that no man can discover

where the leaves fall not land of my people forever

failing and flying

everyone forgets that icarus also flew

its the same when love comes to an end

or the marriage fails and people say

they knew it was a mistake that everybody

said it would never work that she was

old enough to know better but anything

worth doing is worth doing badly

like being there by that summer ocean

on the other side of the island while

love was fading out of her the stars

burning so extravagantly those nights that

anyone could tell you they would never last

every morning she was asleep in my bed

like a visitation the gentleness in her

like antelope standing in the dawn mist

each afternoon i watched her coming back

through the hot stony field after swimming

the sea light behind her and the huge sky

on the other side of that listened to her

while we ate lunch how can they say

the marriage failed like the people who

came back from provence when it was provence

and said it was pretty but the food was greasy

i believe icarus was not failing as he fell

but just coming to the end of his triumph

real poetry is to lead a beautiful life to live poetry is better than to write it

the sun just touched the morning

the morning happy thing

supposed that he had come to dwell

and life would be all spring

madness and chaos are selfdestructing but over thinking is the suicide

ive tried

to become someone else for a while

only to discover that he too was me

oh the things we invent when we are scared

and want to be rescued

i thought leaving you would be easy

just walking out the door

but i keep getting pinned against it

with my legs around your waist and it’s like

my lips want you like my lungs want air

it’s just what they where born to do so

i am sitting at work thinking of you

cutting vegetables in my kitchen

your hair in my shower drain

your fingers on my spine in the morning

while we listen to muddy waters i know

you will never be the one i call home

but the way you talk about poems

it makes me want to keep trying

i’m still looking for reasons to love you

i’m still looking for proof you love me

i dont want to go on being a root in the dark

vacillating stretched out shivering with sleep

downward in the soaked guts of the earth

absorbing and thinking eating each day

love sorrow she is yours now and you must

take care of what has been

into her little coat hold her hand

especially when crossing a street for think

what if you should lose her then you would be

sorrow yourself her drawn face her sleeplessness

would be yours take care touch

her forehead that she feel herself not so

utterly alone and smile that she does not

altogether forget the world before the lesson

have patience in abundance and do not

ever lie or ever leave her even for a moment

by herself which is to say possibly again

abandoned she is strange mute difficult

sometimes unmanageable but remember she is a child

and amazing things can happen and you may see

as the two of you go

walking together in the morning light how

little by little she relaxes she looks about her

she begins to grow

to fall in love with someones thoughts  the most intimate splendid romance

i must down to the seas again to the lonely sea and the sky

and all i ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by

and the wheels kick and the winds song and the white sails shaking

and a grey mist on the seas face and a grey dawn breaking

i must down to the seas again for the call of the running tide

is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied

and all i ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying

and the flung spray and the blown spume and the seagulls crying

i must down to the seas again to the vagrant gypsy life

to the gulls way and the whales way where the winds like a whetted knife

and all i ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellowrover

and quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long tricks over

here

im here

the snow falling

you will recognize your own path

when you come upon it

because you will suddenly have all the energy

and imagination you will ever need

democracy bah when i hear that i reach for my feather boa

no one but night with tears on her dark face watches beside me in this windy place

this poetry i never know what im going to say

a wounded dear leaps the highest

she had just enough madness to make her interesting

she was broken i think it’s because she loved too much and she was always blind to the fact that love too is sometimes broken

it is always better

to avenge dear ones than to indulge in mourning

for every one of us living in this world

means waiting for our end let whoever can

win glory before death when a warrior is gone

that will be his best and only bulwark

in the dark i rest

unready for the light which dawns

day after day

eager to be shared

more of the night before i open

eyes and heart

to illumination i must still

grow in the dark like a root

not ready not ready at all

if you come as softly

as wind within the trees

you may hear what i hear

see what sorrow sees

if you come as lightly

as threading dew

i will take you gladly

nor ask more of you

you may sit beside me

silent as a breath

only those who stay dead

and if you come i will be silent

nor speak harsh words to you

i will not ask you why now

or how or what you do

we shall sit here softly

and the rich earth between us

shall drink our tears

though we tremble before uncertain futures

may we meet illness death and adversity with strength

may we dance in the face of our fears

i want to be with someone who dreams of doing everything in life

and nothing on rainy sunday afternoons

the only thing

to be

is to

as one

you talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts

and when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips and sound is a diversion and a pastime

and in much of your talking thinking is half murdered

if poetry comes not as naturally as the leaves to a tree it had better not come at all

another lover hits the universe the circle is broken but with death comes rebirth and like all lovers and sad people i am a poet

depression is being colorblind and constantly told how colorful the world is

poetry is an echo asking a shadow to dance

so many things i had thought forgotten

return to my mind with stranger pain

like letters that arrive addressed to someone

who left the house so many years ago

and so sepúlchred in such pomp dost lie

that kings for such a tomb would wish to die

were knowledge all what were our need

to thrill and faint and sweetly bleed

women who focus on style over substance usually find themselves in a big fucking hole with other men who want to fuck the hole oh so smooth and none sophistacted because you know how sophisticated can holefucking really be

some of them quite

exotic and far away

but i always returned to myself

the night has a thousand eyes

and the day but one

yet the light of the bright world dies

with the dying sun

the mind has a thousand eyes

and the heart but one

yet the light of a whole life dies

when love is done

and would it have been worth it after all

would it have been worth while

after the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets

after the novels after the teacups after the skirts that trail along the floor

and this and so much more

the stars began to burn

through the sheets of clouds

and there was a new voice

which you slowly

recognized as your own

safety isnt always safe you can find one on every gun

i often stood in front of the mirror alone wondering how ugly a person could get

death be not proud

death be not proud though some have called thee

mighty and dreadful for thou art not so

for those whom thou thinkst thou dost overthrow

die not poor death nor yet canst thou kill me

from rest and sleep which but thy pictures be

much pleasure then from thee much more must flow

and soonest our best men with thee do go

rest of their bones and souls delivery

thourt slave to fate chance kings and desperate men

and dost with poison war and sickness dwell

and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well

and better than thy stroke  why swellst thou then

one short sleep past we wake eternally

and death shall be no more death thou shalt die

ink runs from the corners of my mouth

there is no happiness like mine

i have been eating poetry

take this kiss upon the brow

and in parting from you now

you are not wrong who deem

that my days have been a dream

yet if hope has flown away

in a night or in a day

in a vision or in none

is it therefore the less gone

all that we see or seem

is but a dream within a dream

my love is like a red red rose

thats newly sprung in june

my love is like the melody

thats sweetly played in tune

how fair art thou my bonnie lass

so deep in love am i

and i will love thee still my dear

till all the seas gang dry

till all the seas gang dry my dear

and the rocks melt with the sun

i will love thee still my dear

while the sands of life shall run

and fare thee weel my only love

and fare thee weel awhile

and i will come again my love

though it were ten thousand mile

sir i admit your general rule

that every poet is a fool

but you yourself may serve to show it

that every fool is not a poet

theres two kinds of womenthose you write poems about and those you dont

perfumes are the feelings of flowers

and the most beautiful words ever spoken i have not yet said to you

poetry is the liquid voice that can wear through stone

ah when to the heart of man

was it ever less than a treason

to go with the drift of things

to yield with a grace to reason

and bow and accept the end

of a love or a season

if you must write prose or poems the words you use should be your own dont plagiarize or take on loan theres always someone somewhere with a big nose who knows wholl trip you up and laugh when you fall

as unto the bow the the cord is

so unto the man is woman

though she bends him she obeys him

though she draws him  yet she follows

useless each without the other

she lived with hurricane eyes and fell in love with the way the waves collapsed against her cheeks

if i never meet you

in this life

let me feel the lack

a glance from your eyes

then my life

will be yours

stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems

you shall possess the good of the earth and sun there are millions of suns left

you shall no longer take things at second or third hand nor look through the eyes of the dead nor feed on the spectres in books

you shall not look through my eyes either nor take things from me

you shall listen to all sides and filter them from yourself

appreciate the moment of a first kiss it may be the last time you own your heart

so runs my dream but what am i

an infant crying in the night

an infant crying for the light

and with no language but a cry

some people will tell you there is a great deal of poetry and fine sentiment in a chest of tea

she who reconciles the illmatched threads

of her life and weaves them gratefully

into a single cloth –

it’s she who drives the loudmouths from the hall

and clears it for a different celebration

society will always be too fragile to accept us for all that makes us beautiful

you should always be trying to write a poem you are unable to write a poem you lack the technique the language the courage to achieve otherwise youre merely imitating yourself going nowhere because thats always easiest

wherever i go i meet myself

please give your

bodies and your

to

who

deserve them

there is

no way

the

you would bring

and

i wish you

and

out

but not

you

because philosophy arises from awe a philosopher is bound in his way to be a lover of myths and poetic fables poets and philosophers are alike in being big with wonder

poetry and art and knowledge are sacred and pure

to pay attention this is our endless and proper work

her happiness floated like waves of ocean along the coast of her life she found lyrics of her life in his arms but she never sung her song

pity me that the heart is slow to learn

what the swift mind beholds at every turn

there is nothing

prettier in the

than a girl

with every breath she takes

if i lived a million lives i wouldve felt a million feelings and i still wouldve fallen a million times for you

there will come soft rains

there will come soft rains and the smell of the ground

and swallows circling with their shimmering sound

and frogs in the pool singing at night

and wild plumtrees in tremulous white

robins will wear their feathery fire

whistling their whims on a low fencewire

and not one will know of the war not one

will care at last when it is done

not one would mind neither bird nor tree

if mankind perished utterly

and spring herself when she woke at dawn

would scarcely know that we were gone

it’s funny for all it took was a broken heart and that alone was enough enough for her to do everything she ever dreamed of

i am not yours not lost in you

not lost although i long to be

lost as a candle lit at noon

lost as a snowflake in the sea

you love me and i find you still

a spirit beautiful and bright

yet i am i who long to be

lost as a light is lost in light

my world was the size of a crayon box and it took every colour to draw her

if only you would realize some day how much have you hurt me

if only your heart ever craves for me or my presence…

if only you feel that love again someday for me

if only you are affected someday by my absence…

only you can end all my suffering and this unbearable pain

if only you would know what you could never procure…

if only you go through the memories of past once again

since the day you left my heart has bled no one has its cure…

if only you would bring that love those showers and that rain…

if only you would come back and see what damage you create

i’ve been waiting for your return since forever more…

if only you would see the woman that you have made

you said we cannot sail through how were you so sure

if only you can feel the old things that can never fade

you may have moved on but a piece of my heart is still with you…

i know how i’ve come so far alone i know how i’m able to wade

people say that i’m insane and you won’t ever come back again…

maybe you would have never made your separate way

maybe you would have stayed with me and proved everyone wrong…

if only you would know the pain of dying every day

if only you would feel the burden of smiling and being strong…

the truth is i didn’t need therapy i just needed to feel loved and know that someone out there craved my attention

truths are written never said lines are drawn but then they fade

if you want to annoy a poet explain his poetry

suddenly everything was beautiful the way she viewed the world was nothing more but a reflection of herself

my wife with the hair of a wood fire

with the thoughts of heat lightning

with the waist of an hourglass

with the waist of an otter in the teeth of a tiger

my wife with the lips of a cockade and of a bunch of stars of the last magnitude

with the teeth of tracks of white mice on the white earth

with the tongue of rubbed amber and glass

my wife with the tongue of a stabbed host

with the tongue of a doll that opens and closes its eyes

with the tongue of an unbelievable stone

my wife with the eyelashes of strokes of a childs writing

with brows of the edge of a swallows nest

my wife with the brow of slates of a hothouse roof

and of steam on the panes

my wife with shoulders of champagne

and of a fountain with dolphinheads beneath the ice

my wife with wrists of matches

my wife with fingers of luck and ace of hearts

with fingers of mown hay

my wife with armpits of marten and of beechnut

and of midsummer night

of privet and of an angelfish nest

with arms of seafoam and of riverlocks

and of a mingling of the wheat and the mill

my wife with legs of flares

with the movements of clockwork and despair

my wife with calves of eldertree pith

my wife with feet of initials

with feet of rings of keys and java sparrows drinking

my wife with a neck of unpearled barley

my wife with a throat of the valley of gold

of a tryst in the very bed of the torrent

with breasts of night

my wife with breasts of a marine molehill

my wife with breasts of the rubys crucible

with breasts of the roses spectre beneath the dew

my wife with the belly of an unfolding of the fan of days

with the belly of a gigantic claw

my wife with the back of a bird fleeing vertically

with a back of quicksilver

with a back of light

with a nape of rolled stone and wet chalk

and of the drop of a glass where one has just been drinking

my wife with hips of a skiff

with hips of a chandelier and of arrowfeathers

and of shafts of white peacock plumes

of an insensible pendulum

my wife with buttocks of sandstone and asbestos

my wife with buttocks of swans backs

my wife with buttocks of spring

with the sex of an iris

my wife with the sex of a miningplacer and of a platypus

my wife with a sex of seaweed and ancient sweetmeat

my wife with a sex of mirror

my wife with eyes full of tears

with eyes of purple panoply and of a magnetic needle

my wife with savanna eyes

my wife with eyes of water to he drunk in prison

my wife with eyes of wood always under the axe

my wife with eyes of waterlevel of level of air earth and fire

spades take up leaves

no better than spoons

and bags full of leaves

are light as balloons

i make a great noise

of rustling all day

like rabbit and deer

but the mountains i raise

elude my embrace

flowing over my arms

and into my face

i may load and unload

again and again

till i fill the whole shed

and what have i then

next to nothing for weight

and since they grew duller

from contact with earth

next to nothing for color

next to nothing for use

but a crop is a crop

and whos to say where

the harvest shall stop

what though the radiance which was once so bright

be now for ever taken from my sight

though nothing can bring back the hour

of splendor in the grass of glory in the flower

we will grieve not rather find

strength in what remains behind

tonight i can write the saddest lines

write for examplethe night is shattered

and the blue stars shiver in the distance

the night wind revolves in the sky and sings

tonight i can write the saddest lines

i loved her and sometimes she loved me too

through nights like this one i held her in my arms

i kissed her again and again under the endless sky

she loved me sometimes and i loved her too

how could one not have loved her great still eyes

tonight i can write the saddest lines

to think that i do not have her to feel that i have lost her

to hear the immense night still more immense without her

and the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture

what does it matter that my love could not keep her

the night is shattered and she is not with me

this is all in the distance someone is singing in the distance

my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her

my sight searches for her as though to go to her

my heart looks for her and she is not with me

the same night whitening the same trees

we of that time are no longer the same

i no longer love her thats certain but how i loved her

my voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing

anothers she will be anothers like my kisses before

i no longer love her thats certain but maybe i love her

love is so short forgetting is so long

because through nights like this one i held her in my arms

my sould is not satisfied that it has lost her

though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer

and these the last verses that i write for her

we pull our boots on with both hands

but we cant punch ourselves awake and all i can do

is stand on the curb and say sorry

about the blood in your mouth i wish it was mine

i couldnt get the boy to kill me but i wore his jacket for the longest time

i had to learn to live without you and i couldnt make sense of it because i left so much of me inside of you

poetry is a way of taking life by the throat

so early its still almost dark out

im near the window with coffee

and the usual early morning stuff

that passes for thought

when i see the boy and his friend

walking up the road

to deliver the newspaper

they wear caps and sweaters

and one boy has a bag over his shoulder

they are so happy

they arent saying anything these boys

i think if they could they would take

each others arm

its early in the morning

and they are doing this thing together

they come on slowly

the sky is taking on light

though the moon still hangs pale over the water

such beauty that for a minute

death and ambition even love

doesnt enter into this

happiness it comes on

unexpectedly and goes beyond really

any early morning talk about it

love is a deeper season

than reason

my sweet one

she walks in beauty like the night

of cloudless climes and starry skies

and all that’s best of dark and bright

meet in her aspect and her eyes

thus mellow’d to that tender light

which heaven to gaudy day denies

one shade the more one ray the less

had half impaired the nameless grace

which waves in every raven tress

or softly lightens o’er her face

where thoughts serenely sweet express

how pure how dear their dwellingplace

and on that cheek and o’er that brow

so soft so calm yet eloquent

the smiles that win the tints that glow

but tell of days in goodness spent

a mind at peace with all

a heart whose love is innocent

i wish i was either in your arms full of faith or that a thunder bolt would strike me

coming forth into the light

i was born the day

what is

what was

and

what if

i was transformed the day

my ego shattered

and all the superficial material

things that mattered

to me before

to matter

i really came into being

the day i no longer cared about

what the world thought of me

only on my thoughts for

changing the world

each person you meet

is an aspect of yourself

remember your greatness

before you were born

and were still too tiny for

the human eye to see

you won the race for life

from among  million competitors

and yet

how fast you have forgotten

your strength

when your very existence

is proof of your greatness

you were born a winner

one who defied the odds

by surviving the most gruesome

battle of them all

and now that you are a giant

why do you even doubt victory

against smaller numbers

and wider margins

the only walls that exist

are those you have placed in your mind

and whatever obstacles you conceive

exist only because you have forgotten

what you have already

poetry by suzy kassem

i have a lot of work to do today

i need to slaughter memory

turn my living soul to stone

then teach myself to live again

you dance inside my chest

where no one sees you

but sometimes i do and that

sight becomes this art

i sometimes hold it half a sin

to put in words the grief i feel

and half conceal the soul within

but for the unquiet heart and brain

the sad mechanic exercise

in words like weeds ill wrap me oer

like coarsest clothes against the cold

but that large grief which these enfold

is given in outline and no more

i like for you to be still

i like for you to be still

it is as though you are absent

and you hear me from far away

and my voice does not touch you

it seems as though your eyes had flown away

and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth

as all things are filled with my soul

you emerge from the things

filled with my soul

you are like my soul

and you are like the word melancholy

i like for you to be still

and you seem far away

it sounds as though you are lamenting

and you hear me from far away

and my voice does not reach you

let me come to be still in your silence

and let me talk to you with your silence

that is bright as a lamp

simple as a ring

you are like the night

with its stillness and constellations

your silence is that of a star

as remote and candid

i like for you to be still

it is as though you are absent

distant and full of sorrow

so you wouldve died

one word then one smile is enough

and im happy

happy that its not true

it was her chaos that made her beautiful

i worry there is something broken in our generation

there are too many sad eyes on happy faces

when you are old and grey and full of sleep

and nodding by the fire take down this book

and slowly read and dream of the soft look

your eyes had once and of their shadows deep

to feel most beautifully alive means to be reading something beautiful ready always to apprehend in the flow of language the sudden flash of poetry

to solitude

o solitude if i must with thee dwell

let it not be among the jumbled heap

of murky buildings climb with me the steep—

nature’s observatory—whence the dell

its flowery slopes its river’s crystal swell

may seem a span let me thy vigils keep

’mongst boughs pavillion’d where the deer’s swift leap

startles the wild bee from the foxglove bell

but though i’ll gladly trace these scenes with thee

yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind

whose words are images of thoughts refin’d

is my soul’s pleasure and it sure must be

almost the highest bliss of humankind

when to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee

dont tell me youre not beautiful youre the kind of beautiful the blind would see if we could figure out some way to give them three seconds of sight

i live not in myself but i become

portion of that around me and to me

high mountains are a feeling but the hum

this world

that was our home

for a brief spell

but pain and grief

its a shame that not one of our problems

we depart

with a thousand regrets

in our hearts

i asked him for it

for the blood for the rust

i didn’t want the pearls other girls talked about

or the fine marble of palaces

or even the roses in the mouth of servants

i wanted him

so i grabbed my king and ran away

to a land of death

where i reigned and people whispered

that i’d been dragged

i’ll tell you i’ve changed i’ll tell you

the red on my lips isn’t wine

i hope you’ve heard of horns

but that isn’t half of it out of an entire kingdom

he kneels only to me

mama mama i hope you get this

know the bed is warm and our hearts are cold

know never have i been better

than when i am here

do not send flowers

we’ll throw them in the river

‘flowers are for the dead’ ‘least that’s what

the mortals say

i’ll come back when he bores me

but mama

not today

hear the sledges with the bells

what a world of merriment their melody foretells

how they tinkle tinkle tinkle

in the icy air of night

while the stars that oversprinkle

all the heavens seem to twinkle

with a crystalline delight

to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells

from the bells bells bells bells

from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells

hear the mellow wedding bells

what a world of happiness their harmony foretells

through the balmy air of night

how they ring out their delight

from the molten  golden notes

and all in tune

what a liquid ditty floats

to the turtle  dove that listens while she gloats

on the moon

oh from out the sounding cells

what a gush of euphony voluminously wells

how it swells

how it dwells

on the future  how it tells

of the rapture that impels

to the swinging and the ringing

of the bells bells bells

of the bells bells bells bells

to the rhyming and the chiming of the bells

hear the loud alarum bells

what a tale of terror now their turbulency tells

in the startled ear of night

how they scream out their affright

too much horrified to speak

they can only shriek shriek

out of tune

in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire

in a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire

with a desperate desire

and a resolute endeavor

now  now to sit or never

by the side of the pale  faced moon

oh the bells bells bells

what a tale their terror tells

how they clang and clash and roar

what a horror they outpour

on the bosom of the palpitating air

yet the ear it fully knows

by the twanging

and the clanging

how the danger ebbs and flows

yet the ear distinctly tells

in the jangling

and the wrangling

how the danger sinks and swells

by the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells

of the bells

of the bells bells bells bells

in the clamor and the clanging of the bells

hear the tolling of the bells

what a world of solemn thought their monody compels

in the silence of the night

how we shiver with affright

at the melancholy menace of their tone

for every sound that floats

from the rust within their throats

is a groan

and the people  ah the people

they that dwell up in the steeple

all alone

and who tolling tolling tolling

in that muffled monotone

feel a glory in so rolling

on the human heart a stone

they are neither man nor woman

they are neither brute nor human

they are ghouls

and their king it is who tolls

and he rolls rolls rolls

a paean from the bells

and his merry bosom swells

with the paean of the bells

and he dances and he yells

to the paean of the bells

of the bells

to the throbbing of the bells

of the bells bells bells

to the sobbing of the bells

as he knells knells knells

to the rolling of the bells

of the bells bells bells

to the tolling of the bells

of the bells bells bells bells

to the moaning and the groaning of the bells

love is a fire that burns unseen

a wound that aches yet isn’t felt

an always discontent contentment

a pain that rages without hurting

a longing for nothing but to long

a loneliness in the midst of people

a never feeling pleased when pleased

a passion that gains when lost in thought

it’s being enslaved of your own free will

it’s counting your defeat a victory

it’s staying loyal to your killer

but if it’s so selfcontradictory

how can love when love chooses

bring human hearts into sympathy

the most beautiful part of your body

is where it’s headed  remember

with the world

they say that i am a poet

i wonder what they would say if they saw me from the inside i bottle

emotions and place them into the sea for others to unbottle on

distant shores i am unsure as to whether they ever reach and for

that matter as to whether i ever get my point across

or my love

how can i live without thee how forego

thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined

to live again in these wild woods forlorn

should god create another eve and i

would never from my heart no no i feel

the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh

bone of my bone thou art and from thy state

mine never shall be parted bliss or woe

however i with thee have fixed my lot

certain to undergo like doom if death

consort with thee death is to me as life

so forcible within my heart i feel

the bond of nature draw me to my own

my own in thee for what thou art is mine

our state cannot be severed we are one

one flesh to lose thee were to lose myself

ill die for your sins if you live for mine

to be human is to be broken and broken is its own kind of beautiful

being human means throwing your whole life on the scales of destiny when need be all the while rejoicing in every sunny day and every beautiful cloud

is it the sea you hear in me

its dissatisfactions

or the voice of nothing that was you madness

from elm written  april

the blood jet is poetry

there is no stopping it

from kindness written  february

when we two parted

when we two parted

in silence and tears

to sever for years

pale grew thy cheek and cold

truly that hour foretold

sorrow to this

the dew of the morning

sunk chill on my brow—

it felt like the warning

of what i feel now

thy vows are all broken

and light is thy fame

and share in its shame

they name thee before me

a knell to mine ear

a shudder comes oer me—

why wert thou so dear

they know not i knew thee

who knew thee too well

too deeply to tell

in silence i grieve

that thy heart could forget

if i should meet thee

after long years

how should i greet thee

with silence and tears

from

the moment

this one

the

sparrows and cats will live in my shoe

sooner than i will live with you

fish will come walking out of the sea

sooner than you will come back to me

as wave is driven by wave

and each pursued pursues the wave ahead

so time flies on and follows flies and follows

always for ever and new what was before

is left behind what never was is now

and every passing moment is renewed

i only know that learning to believe in the power of my own words has been the most freeing experience of my life it has brought me the most light and isnt that what a poem is a lantern glowing in the dark

the rainy day

the day is cold and dark and dreary

it rains and the wind is never weary

the vine still clings to the mouldering wall

but at every gust the dead leaves fall

and the day is dark and dreary

my life is cold and dark and dreary

it rains and the wind is never weary

my thoughts still cling to the mouldering past

but the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast

and the days are dark and dreary

be still sad heart and cease repining

behind the clouds is the sun still shining

thy fate is the common fate of all

into each life some rain must fall

some days must be dark and dreary

but some nights i must tell you

i go down there after everyone has fallen asleep

i swim back and forth in the echoing blackness

i sing a love song as well as i can

lost for a while in the home of the rain

i like too many things and get all confused and hungup running from one falling star to another til i drop

use the wings of the flying universe

dream with open eyes

poets are damned… but see with the eyes of angels

introduction to poetry

i ask them to take a poem

and hold it up to the light

or press an ear against its hive

i say drop a mouse into a poem

and watch him probe his way out

or walk inside the poems room

and feel the walls for a light switch

i want them to waterski

across the surface of a poem

waving at the authors name on the shore

but all they want to do

is tie the poem to a chair with rope

and torture a confession out of it

they begin beating it with a hose

to find out what it really means

each in the most hidden sack kept

the lost jewels of memory

intense love secret nights and permanent kisses

the fragment of public or private happiness

a few the wolves collected thighs

other men loved the dawn scratching

mountain ranges or ice floes locomotives numbers

for me happiness was to share singing

praising cursing crying with a thousand eyes

i ask forgiveness for my bad ways

my life had no use on earth

see with your soul and not your eyes

because to dance with the beasts you

must penetrate their disguise

but my heart is an old house

the kind my mother

grew up in

hell to heat and cool

and faulty in the wiring

and though it’s nice to look at

i have no business

licence my roving hands and let them go

before behind between above below

a poets autobiography is his poetry anything else is just a footnote

love is a clash of lightnings

who is the third who walks always beside you

when i count there are only you and i together

but when i look ahead up the white road

there is always another one walking beside you

i do not know whether a man or a woman

but who is that on the other side of you

there is another alphabet whispering from every leaf singing from every river shimmering from every sky

such sweet compulsion doth in music lie

twas brillig and the slithy toves

did gyre and gimble in the wabe

all mimsy were the borogoves

and the mome raths outgrabe

beware the jabberwock my son

the jaws that bite the claws that catch

beware the jubjub bird and shun

the frumious bandersnatch

he took his vorpal sword in hand

long time the manxome foe he sought—

so rested he by the tumtum tree

and stood awhile in thought

and as in uffish thought he stood

the jabberwock with eyes of flame

came whiffling through the tulgey wood

and burbled as it came

one two one two and through and through

the vorpal blade went snickersnack

he left it dead and with its head

he went galumphing back

and hast thou slain the jabberwock

come to my arms my beamish boy

he chortled in his joy

twas brillig and the slithy toves

did gyre and gimble in the wabe

all mimsy were the borogoves

and the mome raths outgrabe

i am not collarbones or drunken letters never sent i am not the way i leave or left or didn’t know how to handle anything

at any time

and i am not your fault

by daily dying i have come to be

it was never about the world being too big it was more like she was too much for the world to handle

maybe i hope too much maybe i dream too much or maybe i love too much to just give up on you

sometimes i dont know which moment

which cool gust of wind will come

and enchant me

tousling my hair

and my heart

stirringthat familiar ache of poetry

which drop will kiss

the old wrench in my soul

reminding me all over again

i miss you better in the rain

look in my face my name is mighthavebeen

i am also calld nomore toolate farewell

the abandoned valley

can you understand being alone so long

you would go out in the middle of the night

and put a bucket into the well

so you could feel something down there

tug at the other end of the rope

since then at an uncertain hour

that agony returns

and till my ghastly tale is told

this heart within me burns

i still remember you

as a little girl

who overwaters plants

because she doesn’t know

when to stop giving

kerouac youre ruining american poetry ohara

ohara thats more than you ever did for it kerouac

where are you hiding my love

each day without you will never come again

even today you missed a sunset on the ocean

a silver shadow on yellow rocks i saved for you

a squirrel that ran across the road

a duck diving for dinner

my god there may be nothing left to show you

save wounds and weariness

and hopes grown dead

and wilted flowers i picked for you a lifetime ago

or feeble steps that cannot run to hold you

arms too tired to offer you to a roaring wind

a face too wrinkled to feel the oceans spray

gather the stars if you wish it so

gather the songs and keep them

gather the faces of women

gather for keeping years and years

and then

loosen your hands let go and say goodbye

let the stars and songs go

let the faces and years go

loosen your hands and say goodbye

vers libre free verse or ninetenths of it is not a new metre any more than sleeping in a ditch is a new school of architecture

laying around the lawn

on our

about

how

we all

agreed on the

poetry is an act of peace peace goes into the making of a poet as flour goes into the making of bread

you lethargic waiting upon me

waiting for the fire and i

attendant upon you shaken by your beauty

shaken by your beauty

i act as the tongue of you

tied in your mouth     in mine it begins to be loosened

you know how this is

if i look

at the crystal moon at the red branch

of the slow autumn at my window

if i touch

near the fire

the impalpable ash

or the wrinkled body of the log

everything carries me to you

as if everything that exists

were little boats

that sail

toward those isles of yours that wait for me

the layers

i have walked through many lives

some of them my own

and i am not who i was

though some principle of being

abides from which i struggle

not to stray

when i look behind

as i am compelled to look

before i can gather strength

to proceed on my journey

i see the milestones dwindling

toward the horizon

and the slow fires trailing

from the abandoned campsites

over which scavenger angels

oh i have made myself a tribe

out of my true affections

and my tribe is scattered

how shall the heart be reconciled

to its feast of losses

the manic dust of my friends

those who fell along the way

bitterly stings my face

with my will intact to go

wherever i need to go

and every stone on the road

precious to me

in my darkest night

when the moon was covered

and i roamed through wreckage

live in the layers

not on the litter

though i lack the art

to decipher it

no doubt the next chapter

in my book of transformations

i am not done with my changes

i had found the secret of a garret room

piled high with cases in my father’s name

piled high packed largewhere creeping in and out

among the giant fossils of my past

like some small nimble mouse between the ribs

of a mastodon i nibbled here and there

at this or that box pulling through the gap

the first book first and how i felt it beat

under my pillow in the morning’s dark

an hour before the sun would let me read

my books

work until your eyes are tired and head is heavy and keep working even after that

i’m doing just fine

he ate and drank the precious words

his spirit grew robust

he knew no more that he was poor

nor that his frame was dust

he danced along the dingy days

and this bequest of wings

was but a book what liberty

i will love you with too many commas

but never any asterisks

my nerves are bad tonight yes bad stay with me

speak to me why do you never speak speak

what are you thinking of what thinking what

i never know what you are thinking think

there are two ways to dislike poetry one is to dislike it the other is to read pope

now im borrowed

now im numb

you see how i try

to reach with words

what matters most

and how i fail

in this world

we walk on the roof of hell

i know the place

i know the place

it is true

everything we do

corrects the space

between death and me

and you

your thighs are appletrees your knees are a southern breeze

our love was born

outside the walls

in the wind

in the night

in the earth

and thats why the clay and the flower

the mud and the roots

know your name

the blue river is grey at morning

and evening there is twilight

at dawn and dusk i lie in the dark

wondering if this quiet in me now

is a beginning or an end

it is at the edge of the

petal that love waits

when did you feel your

most euphoric kiss

was i the source

of your greatest bliss

there are moments in every relationship that define when two people start to fall in love

i remove the darth vader house shoes from my satchel and look down at them

you were wearing these during one of those moments

one of the moments i first started to fall in love with you

the way you gave me butterflies that morning

had absolutely nothing to do with anyone else

and everything to do with you

i was falling in love with you that morning

because of you

i take the next item out of the satchel when i pull it out and look up she brings her hands to her mouth in shock

this ugly little gnome

with his smug little grin…

hes the reason i had an excuse to invite you into my house

into my life

you took a lot of aggression out on him over those next few months

i would watch from my window as you would kick him over every time you walked by him

you were so tenacious

that feisty aggressive strongwilled side of you…

the side of you that refused to take crap from this concrete gnome

the side of you that refused to take crap from me

i fell in love with that side of you

because of you

i set the gnome down on the stage and grab the cd

this is your favorite cd

‘layken’s shit’

although now i know you intended for shit to be possessive rather than descriptive

the banjo started playing through the speakers of your car

and i immediately recognized my favorite band

then when i realized it was your favorite band too

the fact that these same lyrics inspired both of us

i fell in love with that about you

that had absolutely nothing to do with anyone else

i fell in love with that about you

because of you

i take a slip of paper out of the satchel and hold it up when i look at her i see eddie slide her a napkin i can’t tell from up here but that can only mean she’s crying

this is a receipt i kept

only because the item i purchased that night was on the verge of ridiculous

chocolate milk on the rocks who orders that

you were different and you didn’t care

you were being you

a piece of me fell in love with you at that moment

because of you

this i hold up another sheet of paper

this i didn’t really like so much

it’s the poem you wrote about me

the one you titled mean

i don’t think i ever told you…

but you made a zero

and then i kept it

to remind myself of all the things i never want to be to you

i pull her shirt from my bag when i hold it into the light i sigh into the microphone

this is that ugly shirt you wear

it doesn’t really have anything to do with why i fell in love with you

i just saw it at your house and thought i’d steal it

no drowning man can know which drop

of water his last breath did stop

sometimes when everything seems at

its worst

when all conspires

and gnaws

and the hours days weeks

stretched there upon my bed

in the dark

looking upward at the ceiling

i get what many will consider an

it’s still nice to be

poetry is a mirror which makes beautiful that which is distorted

vibrates in the memory

odours when sweet violets sicken

live within the sense they quicken

rose leaves when the rose is dead

are heapd for the belovèds bed

and so thy thoughts when thou art gone

love itself shall slumber on

i had embraced you

long before i hugged you

supports me on its giant palm

and like a seaanemone

or simple snail there cautiously

unfolds emerges what i am

poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility

having nothing to struggle

against

they have nothing to struggle

i could do with a bit more excess from now on im going to be immoderateand volatilei shall enjoy loud music and lurid poetry i shall be rampant

humanity i love you because you

are perpetually putting the secret of

life in your pants and forgetting

its there and sitting down

on it

and because you are

i hate you

the last thing one discovers in composing a work is what to put first

too lazy to be ambitious

i let the world take care of itself

ten days worth of rice in my bag

a bundle of twigs by the fireplace

why chatter about delusion and enlightenment

listening to the night rain on my roof

i sit comfortably with both legs stretched out

i dont think all writers are sad she said

i think its the other way around—

all sad people write

your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul

if either your sails or your rudder be broken you can but toss and drift or else be held at a standstill in midseas

for reason ruling alone is a force confining and passion unattended is a flame that burns to its own destruction

therefore let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion that it may sing

and let it direct your passion with reason that your passion may live through its own daily resurrection and like the phoenix rise above its own ashes

when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes

i all alone beweep my outcast state

and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries

and look upon myself and curse my fate

featured like him like him with friends possessd

desiring this mans art and that mans scope

with what i most enjoy contented least

yet in these thoughts myself almost despising

haply i think on thee and then my state

like to the lark at break of day arising

from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate

for thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings

that then i scorn to change my state with kings

this autumn

why am i growing old

shes an old soul with young eyes a vintage heart and a beautiful mind

to a discerning eye —

much sense — the starkest madness —

tis the majority

in this as all prevail —

assent — and you are sane —

demur — youre straightway dangerous —

and handled with a chain —

so here is my story may it bring

some smiles and a tear or so

it happened once upon a time

far away and long ago

outside the night wind keens and wails

come listen to me the teller of tales

my head is full of fire

and grief and my tongue

with shards of glass

in the final analysis it is between you and god it was never between you and them anyway

my heart leaps up when i behold

a rainbow in the sky

so was it when my life began

so is it now i am a man

such was a poet and shall be and is

wholl solve the depths of horror to defend a sunbeams architecture with his life and carve immortal jungles of despair to hold a mountains heartbeat in his hand

i think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation

if thou must love me

if thou must love me let it be for naught

except for loves sake only do not say

of speaking gently—for a trick of thought

that falls in well with mine and certes brought

a sense of pleasant ease on such a day—

for these things in themselves belovèd may

be changed or change for thee—and love so wrought

may be unwrought so neither love me for

thine own dear pitys wiping my cheeks dry

a creature might forget to weep who bore

thy comfort long and lose thy love thereby

but love me for loves sake that evermore

thou mayst love on through loves eternity

you may write me down in history

with your bitter twisted lies

you may tread me in the very dirt

but still like dust ill rise

does my sassiness upset you

why are you beset with gloom

cause i walk like ive got oil wells

pumping in my living room

just like moons and like suns

with the certainty of tides

just like hopes springing high

still ill rise

did you want to see me broken

bowed head and lowered eyes

shoulders falling down like teardrops

weakened by my soulful cries

does my haughtiness offend you

dont you take it awful hard

cause i laugh like ive got gold mines

diggin in my own back yard

you may shoot me with your words

you may cut me with your eyes

you may kill me with your hatefulness

but still like air ill rise

does my sexiness upset you

does it come as a surprise

that i dance like ive got diamonds

at the meeting of my thighs

out of the huts of historys shame

up from a past thats rooted in pain

im a black ocean leaping and wide

welling and swelling i bear in the tide

leaving behind nights of terror and fear

into a daybreak thats wondrously clear

bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave

i am the dream and the hope of the slave

where the bright seraphim in burning row

their loud uplifted angel trumpets blow

funny how our hearts

were designed

to love

so fiercely

but break

ever so gently

i cant even enjoy a blade of grass unless i know theres a subway handy or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life its more important to confirm the least sincere the clouds get enough attention as it is

all i know is a door into the dark

most people are much better at saying things in letters than in conversation and some people can write artistic inventive letters but when they try a poem or story or novel they become pretentious

even if you are alone you wage war with yourself

the first time i saw her

everything in my head went quiet

i saw my face today

and it looked older

without the warmth of wisdom

or the softness

born of pain and waiting

the dreams were gone from my eyes

on my cheeks

pulling at my jaws

so i did my pushups

and wondered if id ever find you

to see my face

with friendlier eyes than mine

hands are no longer hands they are caresses mouths are no longer mouths they are kisses my name is no longer a name it is a call and love is no longer love — love is you

remember me when i am gone away

gone far away into the silent land

when you can no more hold me by the hand

nor i half turn to go yet turning stay

remember me when no more day by day

you tell me of our future that you planned

only remember me you understand

it will be late to counsel then or pray

yet if you should forget me for a while

and afterwards remember do not grieve

for if the darkness and corruption leave

a vestige of the thoughts that once i had

better by far you should forget and smile

than that you should remember and be sad

recipe for happiness khaborovsk or anyplace

one grand boulevard with trees

with one grand cafe in sun

with strong black coffee in very small cups

one not necessarily very beautiful

man or woman who loves you

this is thy hour o soul thy free flight into the wordless

away from books away from art the day erased the lesson done

thee fully forth emerging silent gazing pondering the themes thou lovest best

night sleep and the stars

our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting

the soul that rises with us our lifes star

hath had elsewhere its setting

and cometh from afar

not in entire forgetfulness

and not in utter nakedness

but trailing clouds of glory do we come

i touch you knowing we werent born tomorrow

and somehow each of us will help the other live

and somewhere each of us must help the other die

all bad poetry springs from genuine feeling to be natural is to be obvious and to be obvious is to be inartistic

i know it hurts i know it doesn’t feel good

i know your hunger is different than mine

i know it doesn’t taste the same as mine

imagine you could grow up all over again

and pinpoint the millisecond that you started

mourning each one like it had a family

would you

sometimes i wonder that

sometimes i wonder if you would go back

and watch yourself reappear and disappear right in front of your own eyes

and i love you so much

i am going to hold your little hand through the night

just please eat just a little

you wrote a poem once

about a city of walking skeletons

the teacher called home because you

told her you wished it could be like that

here

let me tell you something about bones baby

they are not warm or soft

the wind whistles through them like they are

and they break too they break right in half

they bruise and splinter like wood

are you hungry

i know i know how much you hate that question

i will find another way to ask it someday

the voices

i know they are all yelling at you to stretch yourself thinner

l hear them counting always counting

i wish i had been there when the world made you

snap yourself in half

i would have told you that your body is not a warzone

that sometimes

it is okay to leave your plate empty

what good are wings without the courage to fly

the wind is the moons imagination wandering

ships that pass in the night and speak each other in passing

only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness

so on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another

only a look and a voice then darkness again and a silence

well go no more aroving

so well go no more aroving

so late into the night

though the heart still be as loving

and the moon still be as bright

for the sword outwears its sheath

and the soul wears out the breast

and the heart must pause to breathe

and love itself have rest

though the night was made for loving

and the day returns too soon

yet well go no more aroving

by the light of the moon

poetry plays novels music they are the cry of the human spirit trying to understand itself and make sense of our world

for a star to be born there is one thing that must happen a gaseous nebula must collapse

so collapse

this is not your destruction

this is your birth

i hung myself today hanged whatever

the point is i hanged myself today and i’m still

i feel fine just bored i keep hoping that

someone will come home and cut me down

but then i keep remembering that if i knew

someone like that i wouldn’t be up here bit

ironic right or is that not ironic i read

somewhere that like anything funny is

in some way ironic but i don’t know if its

funny or not i don’t think my brain owns

funny you know

i feel taller i like that

i’ve never been away from my shadow for

this long it had always clung to my feet

parting momentarily for a quick dive into

the swimming pool but never for five

hours i like it there’s three feet of space

between my two and the floor

i wanted something this morning i may be

stuck but at least i’m three feet closer to it

o love how did you get here

from nick and the candlestick written  october

to the bottom of the night

with your unconstraining voice

still persuade us to rejoice

with the farming of a verse

make a vineyard of the curse

in the deserts of the heart

let the healing fountain start

in the prison of his days

teach the free man how to praise

nothing is more natural than mutual misunderstanding the contrary is always surprising i believe that one never agrees on anything except by mistake and that all harmony among human beings is the happy fruit of an error

what would the world be once bereft

of wet and of wildness let them be left

o let them be left wildness and wet

long live the weeds and the wilderness yet

i keep telling myself

that you’re

just a girl

another leaf blown across my path

destined to pass on

and shrivel into yourself

like all the others

yet despite my venom

you refuse to wither

or fade

you remain golden throughout

and in your gaze i am left to wonder if it is me alone

who feels the fall

you do not know how much they mean to me my friends

and how how rare and strange it is to find

in a life composed so much so much of odds and ends

for indeed i do not love it  you knew you are not blind how keen you are

to find a friend who has these qualities

who has and gives

those qualities upon which friendship lives

how much it means that i say this to you

without these friendshipslife what cauchemar

the master said you must write what you see

but what i see does not move me

the master answered change what you see

wordplay hides a key to reality that the dictionary tries in vain to lock inside every free word

and to scape stormy days i choose an everlasting night

a man walks into a bar and says

take my wife–please

so you do

you take her out into the rain and you fall in love with her

and she leaves you and you’re desolate

you’re on your back in your undershirt a broken man

on an ugly bedspread staring at the water stains

on the ceiling

and you can hear the man in the apartment above you

taking off his shoes

you hear the first boot hit the floor and you’re looking up

you’re waiting

because you thought it would follow you thought there would be

some logic perhaps something to pull it all together

but here we are in the weeds again

here we are

in the bowels of the thing your world doesn’t make sense

and then the second boot falls

and then a third a fourth a fifth

a man walks into a bar and says

take my wife–please

but you take him instead

you take him home and you make him a cheese sandwich

and you try to get his shoes off but he kicks you

and he keeps kicking you

you swallow a bottle of sleeping pills but they don’t work

boots continue to fall to the floor

in the apartment above you

you go to work the next day pretending nothing happened

your coworkers ask

if everything’s okay and you tell them

you’re just tired

and you’re trying to smile and they’re trying to smile

a man walks into a bar you this time and says

make it a double

a man walks into a bar you this time and says

walk a mile in my shoes

a man walks into a convenience store still you saying

i only wanted something simple something generic…

but the clerk tells you to buy something or get out

a man takes his sadness down to the river and throws it in the river

but then he’s still left

with the river a man takes his sadness and throws it away

but then he’s still left with his hands

in a world gushing blood day and night you never stop mopping up pain

mine in the ways that i learn to miss you

hey you dragging the halo

how about a holiday in the islands of grief

tongue is the word i wish to have with you

your eyes are so blue they leak

your legs are longer than a prisoners

im filthier than the coal miners bathtub

and nastier than the breath of charles bukowski

youre a dirty little windshield

im standing behind you on the subway

hard as calculus my breath

be sticking to your neck like graffiti

im sitting opposite you in the bar

waiting for you to uncross your boundaries

i want to rip off your logic

and make passionate sense to you

i want to ride in the swing of your hips

my fingers will dig in you like quotation marks

blazing your limbs into parts of speech

but with me for a lover you wont need

catastrophes what attracted me in the first place

will ultimately make me resent you

ill start telling you lies

and my lies will sparkle

become the bad stars you chart your life by

ill stare at other women so blatantly

youll hear my eyes peeling

because sex with you is like great britain

cold groggy and a little uptight

your bed is a big soft calculator

where my problems multiply

your brain is a garage

i park my bullshit in for free

youre not really my new girlfriend

just another flop sequel of the first one

who was based on the true story of my mother

youre so ugly i forgot how to spell

ill cheat on you like a ninth grade math test

break your heart just for the sound it makes

youre the this we need to put an end to

the more you apologize the less i forgive you

so how about it

i love you i love you

but i’m turning to my verses

and my heart is closing

here with a loaf of bread beneath the bough

a flask of wine a book of verse  and thou

beside me singing in the wilderness

and wilderness is paradise enow

i am—yet what i am none cares or knows

my friends forsake me like a memory lost

i am the selfconsumer of my woes—

they rise and vanish in oblivious host

like shadows in love’s frenzied stifled throes

and yet i am and live—like vapours tossed

time held me green and dying

though i sang in my chains like the sea

i hope to arrive at my death late in love and a little drunk

what are heavy seasand and sorrow

what are brief today and tomorrow

what are frail spring blossoms and youth

what are deep the ocean and truth

down at my typewriter

and i think

not of someone

cause there isnt anyone

to think

about and i wonder

is it worth it

that was her magic—

she could still see

the sunset

even on those

chase your stars fool life is short

stranger pause and look

from the dust of ages

lift this little book

turn the tattered pages

read me do not let me die

search the fading letters finding

steadfast in the broken binding

all that once was i

brushing a girl’s hair

once a day

will solve more problems

than all those

and drugs

we are unraveling our navels so that we may ingest the sun

we are not afraid of the darkness

we trust that the moon shall guide us

we are determining the future at this very moment

we know that the heart is the philosophers stone

our music is our alchemy

would be

you

because you

are

all of it

donuts eggs sunnyside up

you

are the everexpanding

to me

blood was its avatar and its seal

do you remember the sight we saw my soul

that soft summer morning

round a turning in the path

the disgusting carcass on a bed scattered with stones

its legs in the air like a woman in need

burning its wedding poisons

like a fountain with its rhythmic sobs

i could hear it clearly flowing with a long murmuring sound

but i touch my body in vain to find the wound

i am the vampire of my own heart

one of the great outcasts condemned to eternal laughter

who can no longer smile

am i dead

i must be dead

the way

that when you

on their side

they

from

made out

he wanted to be a poet someone else put in while maggie hugged tim and patted his back said hed only lacked the words to be one

a breeze a forgotten summer a smile all can fit into a storefront window

you’re not a bad person you’re just a little bit different and i’m a sucker for that

i’m kissing you now — across

the gap of a thousand years

a lot we have in our head

but things of heart are not yet dead

they have done none but just fled

out of us forgotten just been bled

the best part was

pulling down the

stuffing the doorbell

with rags

putting the phone

in the

and going to bed

for  or

and the next best

to sorrow

and thought to leave her far away behind

but cheerly cheerly

she loves me dearly

she is so constant to me and so kind

we live in an old chaos of the sun

poetry makes life what lights and music do the stage

you never need to apologize

for how you chose to survive

you have six tattoos

we real cool we

left school we

lurk late we

strike straight we

thin gin we

jazz june we

one fine day in the middle of the night two dead boys got up to fight back to back they faced each other they pulled out their swords and shot one another one deaf cop on the beat heard the noise and came and shot the two dead boys

poetry is an awareness of the world a particular way of relating to reality

i am in the middle of it chaos and poetry poetry and love and again complete chaos pain disorder occasional clarity and at the bottom of it all only love poetry sheer enchantment fear humiliation it all comes with love

she is alone

and oh

how brilliantly she shines

the old poets of china

wherever i am the world comes after me

it offers me its busyness it does not believe

that i do not want it now i understand

why the old poets of china went so far and high

into the mountains then crept into the pale mist

i love all things not only the grand but the infinitely small thimble spurs plates flower vases

there is nothing at all that can be talked about adequately and the whole art of poetry is to say what cant be said

the only emperor is the emperor of ice cream

but one kiss levitates above all the others the

intersection of function and desire the i do kiss

the i’ll love you through a brick wall kiss

even when i’m dead i’ll swim through the earth

like a mermaid of the soil just to be next to your bones

she stuck a bookmark in my heart and walked away

even when muddy your wings sparkle bright wonders that heal broken worlds

there are two kinds of people on earth today

two kinds of people no more i say

not the good or the bad for its well understood

the good are half bad the bad are half good

not the happy or sad for in the swiftflying years

bring each man his laughter each man his tears

not the rich or the poor for to count a mans wealth

you must know the state of his conscience and health

not the humble and proud for in lifes busy span

who puts on vain airs is not counted a man

no the two kinds of people on earth i mean

are the people who lift the people who lean

wherever you go youll find the worlds masses

are ever divided into these two classes

and strangely enough you will find too i mean

there is only one lifter to twenty who lean

in which class are you are you easing the load

of the overtaxed lifters who toiled down the road

or are you a leaner who lets others bear

your portion of worry and labor and care

we were hooked when we woke

we had arms for each other

but i yearned to resume

my dreams of another

theres a certain slant of light

that oppresses like the weight

live or die but dont poison everything

well deaths been here

for a long time

it has a hell of a lot

to do with hell

and suspicion of the eye

and the religious objects

and how i mourned them

when they were made obscene

by my dwarfhearts doodle

the chief ingredient

and mud day after day

and the baby on the platter

cooked but still human

cooked also with little maggots

sewn onto it maybe by somebodys mother

the damn bitch

even so

i kept right on going on

lugging myself as if

i were a sawedoff body

in the trunk the steamer trunk

this became perjury of the soul

it became an outright lie

and even though i dressed the body

it was still naked still killed

it was caught

in the first place at birth

but i play it dressed it up

dressed it up like somebodys doll

is life something you play

and all the time wanting to get rid of it

and further everyone yelling at you

to shut up and no wonder

people dont like to be told

that youre sick

and then be forced

to watch

you

down with the hammer

today life opened inside me like an egg

and there inside

after considerable digging

i found the answer

what a bargain

there was the sun

and you realize she does this daily

id known she was a purifier

but i hadnt thought

she was solid

hadnt known she was an answer

god its a dream

lovers sprouting in the yard

and better

a husband straight as a redwood

picking roses off my hackles

if im on fire they dance around it

and cook marshmallows

and if im ice

they simply skate on me

here

all along

thinking i was a killer

anointing myself daily

with my little poisons

but no

im an empress

i wear an apron

my typewriter writes

it didnt break the way it warned

even crazy im as nice

as a chocolate bar

even with the witches gymnastics

they trust my incalculable city

my corruptible bed

i make a soft reply

the witch comes on

and you paint her pink

i come with kisses in my hood

and the sun the smart one

rolling in my arms

so i say live

and turn my shadow three times round

to feed our puppies as they come

the eight dalmatians we didnt drown

despite the warnings the abort the destroy

despite the pails of water that waited

to drown them to pull them down like stones

they came each one headfirst blowing bubbles the color of cataractblue

and fumbling for the tiny tits

just last week eight dalmatians

of a lb lined up like cord wood

each

i promise to love more if they come

because in spite of cruelty

and the stuffed railroad cars for the ovens

i am not what i expected not an eichmann

the poison just didnt take

so i wont hang around in my hospital shift

repeating the black mass and all of it

i say live live because of the sun

the dream the excitable gift

the goodmorrow

i wonder by my troth what thou and i

did till we lovd were we not weand till then

but suckd on countrey pleasures childishly

or snorted we in the seaven sleepers den

twas so but this all pleasures fancies bee

if ever any beauty i did see

which i desird and got twas but a dreame of thee

and now good morrow to our waking soules

which watch not one another out of feare

for love all love of other sights controules

and makes one little roome an every where

let seadiscoverers to new worlds have gone

let maps to other worlds on worlds have showne

let us possesse one world each hath one and is one

and true plaine hearts doe in the faces rest

where can we finde two better hemispheares

what ever dyes was not mixed equally

if our two loves be one or thou and i

love so alike that none doe slacken none can die

a poet who reads his verse in public may have other nasty habits

writings of light assault the darkness more prodigious than meteors

the tall unknowable city takes over the countryside

sure of my life and death i observe the ambitious and would like to

understand them

their day is greedy as a lariat in the air

their night is a rest from the rage within steel quick to attack

they speak of humanity

my humanity is in feeling we are all voices of that same poverty

they speak of homeland

my homeland is the rhythm of a guitar a few portraits an old sword

the willow groves visible prayer as evening falls

more silent than my shadow i pass through the loftily covetous multitude

they are indispensable singular worthy of tomorrow

my name is someone and anyone

i walk slowly like one who comes from so far away he doesnt expect to arrive

let this darkness be a bell tower

quiet friend who has come so far

feel how your breathing makes more space around you

let this darkness be a bell tower

and you the bell as you ring

what batters you becomes your strength

move back and forth into the change

what is it like such intensity of pain

if the drink is bitter turn yourself to wine

in this uncontainable night

be the mystery at the crossroads of your senses

the meaning discovered there

and if the world has ceased to hear you

say to the silent earth i flow

to the rushing water speak i am

in fact she herself once blamed me

because i prayed

this word

she wildly burned for the one she loved and he stood there watching hoping he too would catch a blaze from the violence stirring in her heart

maybe love was meant to save us from ourselves

i will follow you

my love

to the edge of all our days

to our very last

however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were

and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love

i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy

of a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away

once in a while i am struck

all over again by just how blue

the sky appears  on windplayed

to bruise a heart

i have lost my smile

but dont worry

the dandelion has it

you are not what you are

you are darkness

the sea is a desert of waves

resolve and thou art free

his wonders to performs

how to write a poem

catch the air

around the butterfly

i watched the spinning stars grateful sad and proud as only a man who has outlived his destiny and realizes he might yet forge himself another can be

we have seen the best minds of our generation destroyed by boredom at poetry readings

we are the blood

of the witches

you thought were dead

we carry witchcraft in our bones

inside out heads

when the witch hunters

imprisoned out ancestors

when they tried to burn the magic away

someone should have

warned them

that magic cannot be tamed

because you cannot burn away

what has always

been aflame

i walked a mile with pleasure

she chatted all the way

but left me none the wiser

for all she had to say

i walked a mile with sorrow

and ne’er a word said she

but oh the things i learned from her

when sorrow walked with me

i wanted the past to go away i wanted

to leave it like another country i wanted

my life to close and open

like a hinge like a wing like the part of the song

where it falls

down over the rocks an explosion a discovery

to hurry into the work of my life i wanted to know

whoever i was i was

for a little while

know then thyself presume not god to scan

the proper study of mankind is man

placed on this isthmus of a middle state

a being darkly wise and rudely great

with too much knowledge for the sceptic side

with too much weakness for the stoics pride

he hangs between in doubt to act or rest

in doubt to deem himself a god or beast

in doubt his mind or body to prefer

born but to die and reasning but to err

alike in ignorance his reason such

whether he thinks too little or too much

chaos of thought and passion all confused

still by himself abused or disabused

created half to rise and half to fall

great lord of all things yet a prey to all

sole judge of truth in endless error hurld

the glory jest and riddle of the world

go wondrous creature mount where science guides

go measure earth weigh air and state the tides

instruct the planets in what orbs to run

correct old time and regulate the sun

go soar with plato to th’ empyreal sphere

to the first good first perfect and first fair

or tread the mazy round his followers trod

and quitting sense call imitating god

as eastern priests in giddy circles run

and turn their heads to imitate the sun

go teach eternal wisdom how to rule—

then drop into thyself and be a fool

in the loneliest moments

i have been there

for myself

be careful of words

even the miraculous ones

for the miraculous we do our best

sometimes they swarm like insects

and leave not a sting but a kiss

they can be as good as fingers

they can be as trusty as the rock

you stick your bottom on

but they can be both daisies and bruises

yet i am in love with words

they are doves falling out of the ceiling

they are six holy oranges sitting in my lap

they are the trees the legs of summer

and the sun its passionate face

yet often they fail me

i have so much i want to say

so many stories images proverbs etc

but the words arent good enough

the wrong ones kiss me

sometimes i fly like an eagle

but with the wings of a wren

but i try to take care

and be gentle to them

words and eggs must be handled with care

once broken they are impossible

things to repair

the flower bloomed and faded the sun rose and sank the lover loved and went and what the poets said in rhyme the young translated into practice

against the sky

the moon seals it

in the closing of a door

the click of the lock

is not forgotten they

do not die but remain

within the soft edges

of the earth the ash

of house fires and cancer

in sin and forgiveness

dreaming their way into

my hands my heart

if you are a monster stand up

if you are a monster a trickster a fiend

if you’ve built a steampowered wishing machine

if you have a secret a dark past a scheme

if you kidnap maidens or dabble in dreams

come stand by me

if you have been broken stand up

if you have been broken abandoned alone

if you have been starving a creature of bone

if you live in a tower a dungeon a throne

if you weep for wanting to be held to be known

come stand by me

if you are a savage stand up

if you are a witch a dark queen a black knight

if you are a mummer a pixie a sprite

if you are a pirate a tomcat a wright

if you swear by the moon and you fight the hard fight

come stand by me

if you are a devil stand up

if you are a villain a madman a beast

if you are a strowler a prowler a priest

if you are a dragon come sit at our feast

for we all have stripes and we all have horns

we all have scales tails manes claws and thorns

and here in the dark is where new worlds are born

come stand by me

he could build a city has a certain capacity there’s a niche in his chest

where a heart would fit perfectly

and he thinks if he could just maneuver one into place –

well then game over

stars open among the lilies

are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens

this is the silence of astounded souls

from crossing the water written

all artists’ work is autobiographical any writer’s work is a map of their psyche you can really see what their concerns are what their obsessions are and what interests them

i was not prepared sunset end of summer demonstrations

of time as a continuum as something coming to an end

not a suspension the senses wouldn’t protect me

i caution you as i was never cautioned

you will never let go you will never be satiated

you will be damaged and scarred you will continue to hunger

your body will age you will continue to need

you will want the earth then more of the earth–

sublime indifferent it is present it will not respond

it is encompassing it will not minister

meaning it will feed you it will ravish you

it will not keep you alive

a poets mission is to make words do more work than they normally do to make them work on more than one level

i arise from dreams of thee

and a spirit in my feet

has led me who knows how

to thy chamberwindow sweet

because

it is

the only way

i can

reach you

we wear the mask that grins and lies

it hides our cheeks and shades our eyes—

this debt we pay to human guile

with torn and bleeding hearts we smile

all days are nights to see till i see thee

and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me

i see all of us reading ourselves away from ourselves

straining in circles of light to find more light

until the line of words becomes a trail of crumbs

that we follow across a page of fresh snow

to you who eat a lot of rice because you’re lonely

to you who sleep a lot because you’re bored

to you who cry a lot because you are sad i write this down

chew on your feelings that are cornerned like you would chew on rice

anyway life is something that you need to digest

im at that place i grew up to leave

the hidden wellspring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea

and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes

but let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure

and seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line

for self is a sea boundless and measureless

say not i have found the truth but rather i have found a truth

say not i have found the path of the soul say rather i have met the soul walking upon my path

for the soul walks upon all paths

the soul walks not upon a line neither does it grow like a reed

the soul unfolds itself like a lotus of countless petals

it was never the way she looked

always the way she was

i would have fallen in love with her

with my eyes closed

were i with thee

wild nights should be

our luxury

futile – the winds –

to a heart in port –

done with the compass –

done with the chart

ah the sea

the day i bought my cane i realized

i was through with the burden of feet instead

i am going to become a mermaid

i have always liked the ocean the promise

of depth i am tired of this dry world

all of this dust and sickness these barren fields

i want to dive without drowning i want to kiss sharks

i want men to carve me into the bows of their ships

like a prayer before i lure them into the depths

with my fishnet mouth i want the beauty

the gorgeous mutation the fairytale of half body

all the wisdom of a woman without the failures of sex

i am plunging i am not coming up for air

i do not want all this human

my legs move like they resent being legs

my body is wrecked by all this gravity

i cannot face another morning waking up

with no hope of a fairytale here on land

i am always drowning here on land

rather than words comes the thought of high windows

the suncomprehending glass

and beyond it the deep blue air that shows

nothing and is nowhere and is endless

they have the guns we have the poets therefore we will win

everything needs it bone muscles and even

while it calls the earth its home the soul

so the merciful noisy machine

stands in our house working away in its

lunglike voice i hear it as i kneel

before the fire stirring with a

stick of iron letting the logs

lie more loosely you in the upstairs room

are in your usual position leaning on your

right shoulder which aches

all day you are breathing

patiently it is a

beautiful sound it is

your life which is so close

to my own that i would not know

where to drop the knife of

separation and what does this have to do

with love except

everything now the fire rises

and offers a dozen singing deepred

roses of flame then it settles

to quietude or maybe gratitude as it feeds

as we all do as we must upon the invisible gift

our purest sweet necessity the air

when i die dont come i wouldnt want a leaf

to turn away from the sun  it loves it there

theres nothing so spiritual about being happy

but you cant miss a day of it because it doesnt last

as the future ripens in the past

so the past rots in the future

the world was fair the mountains tall

in elder days before the fall

some hae meat and canna eat

and some wad eat that want it

but we hae meat and we can eat

and sae the lord be thankit

for i have learned to look on nature not as in the hour of thoughtless youth but hearing oftentimes the still sad music of humanity

because i knew she could do better

and now shes gone

if i shouldve

just been better

come live with me and be my love

and we will all the pleasures prove

i looked for that which is not nor can be

and hope deferred made my heart sick in truth

but years must pass before a hope of youth

i watched and waited with a steadfast will

and though the object seemed to flee away

that i so longed for ever day by day

i watched and waited still

sometimes i said this thing shall be no more

my expectation wearies and shall cease

i will resign it now and be at peace

yet never gave it oer

sometimes i said it is an empty name

i long for to a name why should i give

the peace of all the days i have to live

yet gave it all the same

for healthy joy and salutary pain

thou knowest the chase useless and again

turnest to follow it

i embraced a cloud

but when i soared

it rained

and true plaine hearts doe in the faces rest

where can we finde two better hemispheares

what ever dyes was not mixt equally

if our two loves be one or thou and i

love so alike that none doe slacken none can die

had we but world enough and time

this coyness lady were no crime

we would sit down and think which way

to walk and pass our long loves day

love what is simple and beautiful

these are the essentials

nobody hears me but just nobody cares

nobody fears me but nobody just stares

nobody belongs to me  nobody remains

no nobody knows nothing

all that remains are remains

eros again now the loosener of limbs troubles me

every beginning has an end and every end has a new beginning dont worry broken soul life will one day come to an end

fireflies in the garden

by robert frost –

here come real stars to fill the upper skies

and here on earth come emulating flies

that though they never equal stars in size

and they were never really stars at heart

achieve at times a very starlike start

only of course they cant sustain the part

i need you because i know i deserve you but let me fall in love with you one last time before i let go so i can remember the beautiful imperfection that rattled my bones

this is perhaps the most noble aim of poetry to attach ourselves to the world around us to turn desire into love to embrace finally what always evades us what is beyond but what is always there – the unspoken the spirit the soul

i have seen your

and brightest days

and i want you to know

that i will be here

loving you

some of the greatest poetry is revealing to the reader the beauty in something that was so simple you had taken it for granted

one hand i extend into myself the other toward others

the best ideas will eat at you for days maybe even weeks until something some incident some impulse triggers you to finally express them

i am the girl who spends hours huddled in a corner of a library trying to find what you love the most about marlowe just so i can write you a poem worthy of shakespeare ive made books my lovers hours my enemies and you the only story

everything comes down so pasteurized

everything comes down  degrees

they say your amplifier is too loud

turn your amplifier down

are we high all alone on our knees

memory is just hips that swing

the past projects fantastic scenes

fuck the clock

as long as there are

human beings about

there is never going to be

any peace

for any individual

upon this earth or

they might

escape to

all you can do

here

or maybe an hour

there

is working toward you

right now and

i mean you

and nobody but

you

the thing i admire most

about you

is no matter how hard

or how much the world

has tried to

beat you

break you

destroy you

and throw you to the wolves

you are still here

turning all your pain

all your suffering

into armor

into determination

into weapons

and earning the respect

of that same pack of wolves

that were meant to rip you

limb from limb

publishing a book of poetry is like dropping a rose petal down the grand canyon and waiting for the echo

the saddest word

in the whole wide world

is the word almost

he was almost in love

she was almost good for him

he almost stopped her

she almost waited

he almost lived

they almost made it

we must bring

our own light

to the

when i heard the learn’d astronomer

when the proofs the figures were ranged in columns before me

when i was shown the charts and the diagrams to add divide and measure them

when i sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the

how soon unaccountable i became tired and sick

till rising and gliding out i wander’d off by myself

in the mystical moist nightair and from time to time

look’d up in perfect silence at the stars

but dear don’t be afraid of love it’s only magic

i was born in the congo

i walked to the fertile crescent and built

the sphinx

i designed a pyramid so tough that a star

that only glows every one hundred years falls

into the center giving divine perfect light

i am bad

i sat on the throne

drinking nectar with allah

i got hot and sent an ice age to europe

to cool my thirst

my oldest daughter is nefertiti

the tears from my birth pains

created the nile

i am a beautiful woman

i gazed on the forest and burned

out the sahara desert

with a packet of goats meat

and a change of clothes

i crossed it in two hours

i am a gazelle so swift

so swift you cant catch me

for a birthday present when he was three

i gave my son hannibal an elephant

he gave me rome for mothers day

my strength flows ever on

my son noah built newark and

i stood proudly at the helm

as we sailed on a soft summer day

i turned myself into myself and was

all praises all praises

i am the one who would save

i sowed diamonds in my back yard

my bowels deliver uranium

the filings from my fingernails are

i caught a cold and blew

my nose giving oil to the arab world

i am so hip even my errors are correct

i sailed west to reach east and had to round off

the earth as i went

the hair from my head thinned and gold was laid

i am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal

i cannot be comprehended except by my permission

i meanican fly

like a bird in the sky

the poets job is to put into words those feelings we all have that are so deep so important and yet so difficult to name to tell the truth in such a beautiful way that people cannot live without it

happy the man and happy he alone

he who can call today his own

he who secure within can say

tomorrow do thy worst for i have lived today

be fair or foul or rain or shine

the joys i have possessed in spite of fate are mine

not heaven itself upon the past has power

but what has been has been and i have had my hour

i’m not aspiring to be someone else – if i’m me for the rest of my life then so be it

variation on the word sleep

i would like to watch you sleeping

which may not happen

i would like to watch you

sleeping i would like to sleep

with you to enter

your sleep as its smooth dark wave

slides over my head

and walk with you through that lucent

with its watery sun  three moons

towards the cave where you must descend

towards your worst fear

i would like to give you the silver

branch the small white flower the one

word that will protect you

from the grief at the center

of your dream from the grief

at the center i would like to follow

you up the long stairway

again  become

the boat that would row you back

to where your body lies

beside me and you enter

it as easily as breathing in

i would like to be the air

that inhabits you for a moment

only i would like to be that unnoticed

that necessary

the weather of love

has a way of wilting

or blossoming

at the strangest

most unpredictable hour

this is how love is

an uncontrollable beast

in the form of a flower

the sun does not always shine on it

nor does the rain always pour on it

nor should it always get beaten by a storm

love does not always emit the sweetest scents

and sometimes it can sting with its thorns

water it

give it plenty of sunlight

nurture it

and the flower of love will

outlive you

neglect it or keep dissecting it

and its petals will quickly curl up and die

this is how love is

perfection is a delusional vision

so love the person who loves you

and abandon the one

who only loves you

but often in the world’s most crowded streets

but often in the din of strife

there rises an unspeakable desire

after the knowledge of our buried life

a thirst to spend our fire and restless force

in tracking out our true original course

a longing to inquire

into the mystery of this heart which beats

so wild so deep in us—to know

whence our lives come and where they go

i felt a cleaving in my mind—

as if my brain had split—

i tried to match it—seam by seam—

but could not make it fit

does something which exists on the edge have no true relevance to the stable center or does it by being on the edge become a part of the edge and thus a part of the boundary the definition which gives the whole its shape

i shall have peace as leafy trees are peaceful

when rain bends down the bough

and i shall be more silent and coldhearted

than you are now

they are not long the days of wine and roses

out of a misty dream

our path emerges for awhile then closes

haiku is not a shriek a howl a sigh or a yawn rather it is the deep breath of life

they all tell you not to fight fire with fire

but that is only because they are afraid of your flames

mcgough im sorry im afraid ive caught poetry

mr bones oh really well dont worry sir  i used to suffer from short stories

mcgough really when

mr bones oh once upon a time

writing is not a matter of time but a matter or of space if you dont keep space in your head for writing you wont write even if you have the time

the young student sits with his head bent over his books and his mind straying in youths dreamland where prose is prowling on the desk and poetry hiding in the heart

i often repeat repeat myself

i dont dont know why know why

i simply know that i i i

am am inclined to say to say

a lot a lot this way this way

i often repeat repeat myself

i often repeat repeat myself

my mom my mom gets mad gets mad

it irritates my dad my dad

it drives them up a tree a tree

thats what they tell they tell me me

i often repeat repeat myself

i often repeat repeat myself

it gets me in a jam a jam

but thats the way i am i am

in fact i think its neat its neat

to to to to repeat repeat

i often repeat repeat myself

in a rich moonlit garden flowers open beneath the eyes of entire nations terrified to acknowledge the simplicity of the beauty of peace

tears are shed in my heart like the rain on the town

it is time to float on the waters of the night

time to wrap my arms around this book

and press it to my chest life preserver

in a sea of unremarkable men and women

anonymous faces on the street

when soul meets soul on lovers lips

rem tene verba sequentur grasp the subject and the words will follow this i believe is the opposite of what happens with poetry which is more a case of verba tene res sequenter grasp the words and the subject will follow

show me slowly what i only

know the limits of

dance me to the end of love

thinking of you is a poison i drink often

when by my solitary hearth i sit

when no fair dreams before my mind’s eye flit

and the bare heath of life presents no bloom

and wave thy silver pinions o’er my head

but tomorrow dawn will come the way i picture her

barefoot and disheveled standing outside my window

in one of the fragile cotton dresses of the poor

she will look in at me with her thin arms extended

offering a handful of birdsong and a small cup of light

a litany for survival

for those of us who live at the shoreline

standing upon the constant edges of decision

crucial and alone

for those of us who cannot indulge

the passing dreams of choice

who love in doorways coming and going

in the hours between dawns

looking inward and outward

at once before and after

seeking a now that can breed

like bread in our childrens mouths

so their dreams will not reflect

the death of ours

for those of us

who were imprinted with fear

like a faint line in the center of our foreheads

learning to be afraid with our mothers milk

for by this weapon

this illusion of some safety to be found

the heavyfooted hoped to silence us

for all of us

this instant and this triumph

we were never meant to survive

and when the sun rises we are afraid

it might not remain

when the sun sets we are afraid

it might not rise in the morning

when our stomachs are full we are afraid

when our stomachs are empty we are afraid

we may never eat again

when we are loved we are afraid

love will vanish

when we are alone we are afraid

love will never return

and when we speak we are afraid

our words will not be heard

nor welcomed

but when we are silent

we are still afraid

so it is better to speak

we were never meant to survive

the most complicated skill is to be simple

a bank is a place where they lend you an umbrella in fair weather and ask for it back when it begins to rain

if you wake up tired you’ve been chasing dreams if you go to bed tired your making your dreams happen

you at least hail me and speak to me

while a thousand others ignore my face

you offer me an hour of love

and your fees are not as costly as most

you are the madonna of the lonely

the firstborn daughter in a world of pain

you do not turn fat men aside

or trample on the stuttering shy ones

you are the meadow where desperate men

can find a moments comfort

men have paid more to their wives

to know a bit of peace

and could not walk away without the guilt

that masquerades as love

you do not bind them lovely maria you comfort them

and bid them return

your body is more christian than the bishops

whose gloved hand cannot feel the dropping of my blood

your passion is as genuine as most

your caring as real

but you maria sacred whore on the endless pavement of pain

you whose virginity each man may make his own

without paying ought but your fee

you who know nothing of virgin births and immaculate conceptions

you who touch mans flesh and caress a stranger

who warm his bed to bring his aching skin alive

you make more sense than stock markets and football games

you offer yourself for a feeand who offers himself for less

at times you are cruel and demandingharsh and insensitive

at times you are shrewd and deceptivegrasping and hollow

the wonder is that at times you are gentle and concerned

warm and loving

you deserve more respect than nuns who hide their sex for eternal love

your fees are not so high nor your prejudice so virtuous

you deserve more laurels than the selfpitying mother of many children

and your fee is not as costly as most

man comes to you when his bed is filled with brass and emptiness

when liquor has dulled his sense enough

to know his need of you

he will come in fantasy and despair maria

and leave without apologies

he will come in lonelinessand perhaps

leave in loneliness as well

but you give him more than soldiers who win medals and pensions

more than priests who offer absolution

and sweetsmelling ritual

more than friends who anticipate his death

or challenge his life

and your fee is not as costly as most

you admit that your love is for a fee

few women can be as honest

there are monuments to statesmen who gave nothing to anyone

except their hungry ego

monuments to mothers who turned their children

into starving anxious bodies

monuments to lady liberty who makes poor men prisoners

i would erect a monument for you

who give more than most

and for a meager fee

among the lonely you are perhaps the loneliest of all

you come so close to love

but it eludes you

while proper women march to church and fantasize

in the silence of their rooms

while lonely women take their husbands arms

to hold them on lifes surface

while chattering women fill their closets with clothes and

their lips with lies

you offer love for a feewhich is not as costly as most

and remain a lonely prostitute on a street of pain

you are not immoral little maria only tired and afraid

but you are not as hollow as the police who pursue you

the politicians who jail you the pharisees who scorn you

you give what you promisetake your paltry feeand

wander on the endless aching pavements of pain

you know more of universal love than the nations who thrive on war

more than the churches whose dogmas are private vendettas made sacred

more than the tall buildings and sprawling factories

you are a lonely prostitute who speaks to me as i pass

and i smile at you because i am a lonely man

my heart born naked

later alone it wore

i carried on my back

the poetry i had read

so i lived for half a century

until wordlessly we met

from my shirt on the back of the chair

how many years

of learning by heart

i waited for you

i love you as the plant that never blooms

but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers

thanks to your love a certain solid fragrence

risen from the earth lives darkly in my body

and

no one can stop the river of your hands

your eyes and their sleepiness my dearest

you are the trembling of time which passes

between the vertical light and the darkening sky

and

from the stormy archipelagoes i brought

my windy accordian waves of crazy rain

the habitual slowness of natural things

they made up my wild heart

if stars are lit

it means there is someone who needs it

it means someone wants them to be

that someone deems those specks of spit

than the love with which

i gaze upon you

than the tenderness

with which i hold you

the history teacher

trying to protect his students innocence

he told them the ice age was really just

the chilly age a period of a million years

when everyone had to wear sweaters

and the stone age became the gravel age

named after the long driveways of the time

the spanish inquisition was nothing more

than an outbreak of questions such as

how far is it from here to madrid

what do you call the matadors hat

the war of the roses took place in a garden

and the enola gay dropped one tiny atom on japan

the children would leave his classroom

for the playground to torment the weak

and the smart

mussing up their hair and breaking their glasses

while he gathered up his notes and walked home

past flower beds and white picket fences

wondering if they would believe that soldiers

in the boer war told long rambling stories

designed to make the enemy nod off

oh what is brighter than the light

what is darker than the night

what is keener than an axe

what is softer than melting wax

truth is brighter than the light

falsehood darker than the night

revenge is keener than an axe

and love is softer than melting wax

time is all we have and don’t

no man was ever yet a great poet without at the same time being a profound philosopher

lord may the pain be ours and the weakness that it brings but at least give us the strength of not showing it to anyone

the lamb misused breeds public strife

and yet forgives the butchers knife

the many men so beautiful

and they all dead did lie

and a thousand thousand slimy things

lived on and so did i

in sunshine and in shadow

but he grew old—

this knight so bold—

and o’er his heart a shadow—

fell as he found

no spot of ground

that looked like eldorado

and as his strength

failed him at length

he met a pilgrim shadow—

‘shadow’ said he

‘where can it be—

this land of eldorado’

‘over the mountains

of the moon

down the valley of the shadow

the shade replied—

‘if you seek for eldorado

love me like a wrong turn on a bad road

she will blaze through you like a gypsy wildfire igniting you soul and dancing in its flames and when she is gone the smell of her smoke will be the only thing left to soothe you

since there is no real silence

silence will contain all the sounds

all the words all the languages

all knowledge all memory

when you were sleeping on the sofa

i put my ear to your ear and listened

to the echo of your dreams

that is the ocean i want to dive in

merge with the bright fish

plankton and pirate ships

i walk up to people on the street that kind of look like you

and ask them the questions i would ask you

can we sit on a rooftop and watch stars dissolve into smoke

rising from a chimney

can i swing like tarzan in the jungle of your breathing

i don’t wish i was in your arms

i just wish i was peddling a bicycle

toward your arms

i could feel the day offering itself to me

and i wanted nothing more

than to be in the momentbut which moment

not that one or that one or that one

for i am not a poem

i am tired and worn out and the eyes you would see would not be painted or inspired

but empty and weary

from drinking too much

at all times

and i am not the life of your party who sings and has glorious words to speak

for i don’t speak much

at all

and my voice is raspy and unsteady from unhealthy living and not much sleep and i only use it when i sing and i always sing too much

or not at all

and never when people are around because they expect poems and symphonies and i am not

but an elegy

at my best

but unedited and uncut and not a lot of people want to work with me because there’s only so much you can do with an audio take with the plugins and eqs and i was born distorted disordered and i’m pretty fine with that

but others are not

the courage of the poet is to keep ajar the door that leads into madness

and drunk with my own madness i shouted at him furiously make life beautiful make life beautiful

what

we

trade our days

an open book and empty cup

on the marble tabletop

while on the shop and street i gazed

my body of a sudden blazed

and twenty minutes more or less

it seemed so great my happiness

that i was blessed and could bless

she was not for everyone but she was for me

september has come it is hers

whose vitality leaps in the autumn

trees without leaves and a fire in the fireplace

so i give her this month and the next

though the whole of my year should be hers who has rendered already

so many of its days intolerable or perplexed

but so many more so happy

who has left a scent on my life and left my walls

dancing over and over with her shadow

whose hair is twined in all my waterfalls

and all of london littered with remembered kisses

in the middle of life death comes

to take your measurements the visit

is forgotten and life goes on but the suit

is being sewn on the sly

afoot and lighthearted i take to the open road

healthy free the world before me

the long brown path before me leading me wherever i choose

henceforth i ask not good fortune i myself am good fortune

henceforth i whimper no more postpone no more need nothing

i don’t think that i’ve been in love as such

although i liked a few folk pretty well

love must be vaster than my smiles or touch

for love girls follow boys to foreign lands

and men have followed women into hell

in plays and poems someone understands

there’s something makes us more than blood and bone

and more than biological demands

for me love’s like the wind unseen unknown

i see the trees are bending where it’s been

i know that it leaves wreckage where it’s blown

i really don’t know what i love you means

i think it means don’t leave me here alone

and perhaps it will be pleasing to have remembered these things one day

life has loveliness to sell

all beautiful and splendid things

soaring fire that sways and sings

and childrens faces looking up

life has loveliness to sell

scent of pine trees in the rain

eyes that love you arms that hold

and for your spirits still delight

holy thoughts that star the night

spend all you have for loveliness

buy it and never count the cost

for one white singing hour of peace

and for a breath of ecstasy

give all you have been or could be

sing your life any fool can think of words that rhyme

to see a world in a grain of sand

and a heaven in a wild flower

hold infinity in the palm of your hand

and eternity in an hour

that’s what i do i make coffee and occasionally succumb to suicidal nihilism but you shouldn’t worry — poetry is still first cigarettes and alcohol follow

i will come back to you i swear i will

and you will know me still

i shall be only a little taller

than when i went

i would not come in

i meant not even if asked

and i hadnt been

i grew up in this town my poetry was born between the hill and the river it took its voice from the rain and like the timber it steeped itself in the forests

you gave me hyacinths first a year ago

they called me the hyacinth girl

—yet when we came back late from the hyacinth garden

your arms full and your hair wet i could not

speak and my eyes failed i was neither

living nor dead and i knew nothing

looking into the heart of light the silence

i am tired beloved of chafing my heart against

the want of you

of squeezing it into little inkdrops

and posting it

angers like a battery that leaks acid right out of me

and it starts from the heart til it reaches my outer me

the worst

thing that ever happened

to

the world

–– the end of the world  the beginning of white supremacy

with the energy

of the mornings

trace your fingers

along the lull

of the afternoons

take the spirit

of the evenings

in your arms

kiss it deeply

and then

to the tranquility

of the nights

there is another world and it is in this one

it costs me never a stab nor squirm  to tread by chance upon a worm  aha my little dear  i say your clan will pay me back one day

i wake to sleep and take my waking slow

i feel my fate in what i cannot fear

i learn by going where i have to go

our

than

our

old words are reborn with new faces

valentines day is the poets holiday

under the greenwood tree

who loves to lie with me

and tune his merry note

unto the sweet birds throat

here shall he see

no enemy

but winter and rough weather

she is neither pink nor pale

and she never will be all mine

she learned her hands in a fairytale

and her mouth on a valentine

she has more hair than she needs

in the sun ’tis a woe to me

and her voice is a string of colored beads

or steps leading into the sea

she loves me all that she can

and her ways to my ways resign

but she was not made for any man

and she never will be all mine

if it aint a pleasure it aint a poem

loneliness clarifies here silence stands

like heat here leaves unnoticed thicken

and past the poppies bluish neutral distance

ends the land suddenly beyond a beach

of shapes and shingle here is unfenced existence

facing the sun untalkative out of reach

and death shall have no dominion

under the windings of the sea

they lying long shall not die windily

twisting on racks when sinews give way

strapped to a wheel yet they shall not break

faith in their hands shall snap in two

and the unicorn evils run them through

split all ends up they shant crack

and death shall have no dominion

i shivered in those

when i heard

the voice

the salt

in the desert

but you hate poetry

yes but you make me want to write it

love her but leave her wild

knockkneed coughing like hags we cursed through sludge

till on the haunting flares we turned our backs

and towards our distant rest began to trudge

but limped on bloodshod all went lame all blind

drunk with fatigue deaf even to the hoots

of disappointed shells that dropped behind

gas gas quick boys an ecstasy of fumbling

fitting the clumsy helmets just in time

but someone still was yelling out and stumbling

and floundering like a man in fire or lime

dim through the misty panes and thick green light

as under a green sea i saw him drowning

in all my dreams before my helpless sight

he plunges at me guttering choking drowning

if in some smothering dreams you too could pace

behind the wagon that we flung him in

and watch the white eyes writhing in his face

his hanging face like a devils sick of sin

if you could hear at every jolt the blood

come gargling from the frothcorrupted lungs

obscene as cancer bitter as the cud

my friend you would not tell with such high zest

to children ardent for some desperate glory

you are an universe of universes and your soul a source of songs

we suffer each other to have each other a while

ill say i love you

which will lead of course

to disappointment

but those words unsaid

i will try to disappoint you

better than anyone else has

in xanadu did kubla khan

where alph the sacred river ran

through caverns measureless to man

down to a sunless sea

my brain hums with scraps of poetry and madness

the aching in my chest

isnt because i miss you

its realizing that you have

become someone i no longer know

your fears your  am thoughts

your achievements

are things i no longer have an equivalent to

who we were and who we are

are four different people

and the me from now

doesnt relate to the me from then

let alone to the you from now

tanzy sayadi and jarod kintz

i used to think love was two people sucking

on the same straw to see whose thirst was stronger

but then i whiffed the crushed walnuts of your nape

traced jackals in the snowcovered tombstones of your teeth

i used to think love was a nonstop saxophone solo

in the lungs till i hung with you like a pair of sneakers

from a phone line and you promised to always smell

the rose in my kerosene i used to think love was terminal

pelvic ballet till you let me jog beside while you pedaled

all over hell on the menstrual bicycle your tongue

ripping through my prairie like a tornado of paper cuts

i used to think love was an old man smashing a mirror

over his knee till you helped me carry the barbell

of my spirit back up the stairs after my car pirouetted

in the desert you are my history book i used to not believe

in fairy tales till i played the dunce in sheep’s clothing

and felt how perfectly your foot fit in the glass slipper

of my ass but then duty wrapped its phone cord

around my ankle and yanked me across the continent

and now there are three thousand miles between the u

and s in esophagus and being without you is like standing

at a cementfilled wall with a roll of yugoslavian nickels

and making a wish some days i miss you so much

i’d jump off the roof of your office building

just to catch a glimpse of you on the way down i wish

we could trade left eyeballs so we could always see

what the other sees but you’re here i’m there

and we have only words a nightly phone call  one chance

to mix feelings into syllables and pour into the receiver

hope they don’t disassemble in that calculus of wire

and lately  with this whole war thing  the language machine

supporting it  i feel betrayed by the alphabet like they’re

injecting strychnine into my vowels infecting my consonants

naming attack helicopters after shattered indian tribes

apache blackhawk and west bank colonizers are settlers

so sharon is davey crockett and arafat geronimo

and it’s the wild west all over again and i imagine picasso

looking in a mirror decorating his face in war paint

washing his brushes in venom and i think of jenin

in all that rubble and i feel like a cyclops with two eyes

like an anorexic with three mouths like a scuba diver

in quicksand like a shark with plastic vampire teeth

like i’m the executioner’s fingernail trying to reason

with the hand and i don’t know how to speak love

when the heart is a busted cup filling with spit and paste

and the only sexual fantasy i have is busting

into the pentagon with a bazookasized pen and blowing

open the minds of generals and i comfort myself

with the thought that we’ll name our first child jenin

and her middle name will be terezin and we’ll teach her

how to glow in the dark and how to swallow firecrackers

and to never neglect the first straw because no one

ever talks about the first straw it’s always the last straw

that gets all the attention but by then it’s way too late

between my finger and my thumb

the squat pen rests snug as a gun

there is no space or time

only intensity

and tame things

have no immensity

and the spring arose on the garden fair

like the spirit of love felt everywhere

and each flower and herb on earths dark breast

rose from the dreams of its wintry rest

fear of joy is the darkest of captivities

some men are born sodomites some achieve sodomy and some have sodomy thrust upon them

the season was waning fast

our nights were growing cold at last

i took her to bed with silk and song

lay still my love i won’t be long

i must prepare my body for passion

o your body you give but all else you ration

it is because of these dreams of a sylvan scene

a bleeding nymph to leave me serene

i have dreams of a trembling wench

you have dreams she said that cannot be quenched

our passion said i should never be feared

as our longing for love can never be cured

our want is our way and our way is our will

we have the love my love that no one can kill

if night is your love then in dreams you’ll fulfill

this love our love that no one can kill

yet want is my way and my way is my will

thus i killed my love with a sleeping pill

if you cannot be a poet be the poem

to those without pity

cruel of heart lay down my song

your reading eyes have done me wrong

not for you was the pen bitten

and the mind wrung and the song written

the silent people

some people are so rude

living their lives with no concern for others

or possibly just intent on pissing other people off

annoying everyone around them

the silent people

want to kill them

and drive forks into their skulls

and scream from the top of their lungs

shut up

but words are not spoken

and attention is not given

the annoying keep on living

she was another broken doll dreaming of a boy with glue

all they want to do

is tie the poem to a chair with rope

and torture a confession out of it

they begin beating it with a hose

to find out what it really means

poetry is prose bewitched a music made of visual thoughts the sound of an idea

the garden

like a skein of loose silk blown against a wall

she walks by the railing of a path in kensington gardens

and she is dying piecemeal

and round about there is a rabble

of the filthy sturdy unkillable infants of the very poor

they shall inherit the earth

in her is the end of breeding

her boredom is exquisite and excessive

she would like some one to speak to her

and is almost afraid that i

will commit that indiscretion

the stars had only one task they taught me how to read

they taught me i had a language in heaven

and another language on earth

as an unperfect actor on the stage

who with his fear is put besides his part

or some fierce thing replete with too much rage

whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart

so i for fear of trust forget to say

the perfect ceremony of loves rite

and in mine own loves strength seem to decay

oerchargd with burden of mine own loves might

o let my books be then the eloquence

and dumb presagers of my speaking breast

who plead for love and look for recompense

more than that tongue that more hath more expressd

o learn to read what silent love hath writ

to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit

deprivation is the mother of poetry

my friend you thought you lost him

that all your life youve been separated from him

filled with wonder youve always looked outside for him

and havent searched within your own house

living is no laughing matter

you must take it seriously

so much so and to such a degree

that for example your hands tied

behind your back

your back to the wall

or else in a laboratory

in your white coat and safety glasses

you can die for people –

even for people whose faces you’ve

even though you know living

is the most real most beautiful

i mean you must take living so

that even at seventy for example you’ll

and not for your children either

but because although you fear death you

don’t believe it

because living i mean weighs heavier

poetry is finer and more philosophical than history for poetry expresses the universal and history only the particular

you call it hope — that fire of fire

it is but agony of desire

i dont wish to be everything to everyone but i would like to be something to someone

green in nature is one thing green in literature another nature and letters seem to have a natural antipathy bring them together and they tear each other to pieces

for you she learned to wear a short black slip

and red lipstick

how to order a glass of red wine

and finish it she learned to reach out

as if to touch your arm and then not

touch it changing the subject

didnt you think shed begin or

werent you sorry

to call your best friends

by their schoolboy names

and give them kisses goodbye

to look away when they say

your wife so your confidence grows

she doesnt ask what you want

because she knows

isnt that what you think

when actually she was only waiting

to be told take off your dress

to be stunned and then do this

never rehearsed but perfectly obvious

in one motion up over and gone

the x of her arms crossing and uncrossing

her face flashing away from you in the fabric

so that you couldnt say if she was

appearing or disappearing

there are three lessons i would write

three words as with a burning pen

and gladness hides her face in scorn

put thou the shadow from thy brow

no night but hath its morn

have love not love alone for one

but man as man thy brother call

and scatter like the circling sun

thy charities on all

living together is one move closer to living apart

no one wants to read poetry you have to make it impossible for them to put the poem downimpossible for them to stop reading it word after word you have to keep them from closing the book

when i have ceased to break my wings

against the faultiness of things

and learned that compromises wait

behind each hardly opened gate

when i can look life in the eyes

grown calm and very coldly wise

life will have given me the truth

and taken in exchange  my youth

to his coy mistress

had we but world enough and time

this coyness lady were no crime

we would sit down and think which way

to walk and pass our long love’s day

thou by the indian ganges’ side

shouldst rubies find i by the tide

of humber would complain i would

love you ten years before the flood

and you should if you please refuse

till the conversion of the jews

my vegetable love should grow

vaster than empires and more slow

an hundred years should go to praise

thine eyes and on thy forehead gaze

two hundred to adore each breast

but thirty thousand to the rest

an age at least to every part

and the last age should show your heart

for lady you deserve this state

nor would i love at lower rate

but at my back i always hear

time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near

and yonder all before us lie

thy beauty shall no more be found

nor in thy marble vault shall sound

my echoing song then worms shall try

that longpreserved virginity

and your quaint honour turn to dust

and into ashes all my lust

the grave’s a fine and private place

but none i think do there embrace

now therefore while the youthful hue

and while thy willing soul transpires

at every pore with instant fires

now let us sport us while we may

and now like amorous birds of prey

rather at once our time devour

than languish in his slowchapped power

let us roll all our strength and all

our sweetness up into one ball

and tear our pleasures with rough strife

thorough the iron gates of life

thus though we cannot make our sun

stand still yet we will make him run

to the virgins to make much of time

gather ye rosebuds while ye may

old time is still aflying

and this same flower that smiles today

tomorrow will be dying

the glorious lamp of heaven the sun

the higher he’s agetting

the sooner will his race be run

and nearer he is to setting

that age is best which is the first

when youth and blood are warmer

but being spent the worse and worst

times still succeed the former

then be not coy but use your time

and while you may go marry

for having lost but once your prime

you may for ever tarry

to what purpose april do you return again

beauty is not enough

you can no longer quiet me with the redness

i know what i know

the sun is hot on my neck as i observe

the spikes of the crocus

the smell of the earth is good

it is apparent that there is no death

but what does that signify

not only under ground are the brains of men

eaten by maggots

life in itself

an empty cup a flight of uncarpeted stairs

it is not enough that yearly down this hill

comes like an idiot babbling and strewing flowers

we flatter those we scarcely know

we please the fleeting guest

and deal full many a thoughtless blow

to those who love us best

we didnt start the fire

it was always burning

since the worlds been turning

we didnt start the fire

no we didnt light it

but we tried to fight it

i wrote too many poems in a language i did not yet know how to speak

but i know now it doesnt matter how well i say grace

if i am sitting at a table where i am offering no bread to eat

so this is my wheat field

you can have every acre love

this is my garden song

this is my fist fight

with that bitter frost

tonight i begged another stage light to become that back alley street lamp that we danced beneath

the night your warm mouth fell on my timid cheek

as i sang maybe i need you

off key

but in tune

maybe i need you the way that big moon needs that open sea

maybe i didnt even know i was here til i saw you holding me

give me the palm of your hand

every strand of my hair is a kite string

and i have been blue in the face with your sky

crying a flood over iowa so you mother will wake to venice

lover i smashed my glass slipper to build a stained glass window for every wall inside my chest

now my heart is a pressed flower and a tattered bible

it is the one verse you can trust

so im putting all of my words in the collection plate

i am setting the table with bread and grace

my knees are bent

like the corner of a page

i am saving your place

inebriate of air — am i —

and debauchee of dew —

from inns of molten blue —

very late i have heard a kind of whispered sighing

not far

like a night wind in pines or like the sea in the dark

the echo of everything that has ever

been spoken

still spinning its one syllable

between the earth and silence

i couldn’t have dreamed you into existence because i didn’t even know i needed you you must have been sent to me

every poem is a coat of arms it must be deciphered how much blood how many tears in exchange for these axes these muzzles these unicorns these torches these towers these martlets these seedlings of stars and these fields of blue

dont ask her to be a rock

for you to lean upon

and point her to the sky

and she will teach you both to fly

how can i find the words poets have taken them all and left me with nothing to say or do

except to teach me for the first time what they meant

he wanders like a dayappearing dream

through the dim wildernesses of the mind

through desert woods and tracts which seem

we are all the fools of time and terror days

steal on us and steal from us yet we live

loathing our life and dreading still to die

i have hunger for your mouth for your voice for your hair

some say dont burn your bridges

i say if necessary

let the kerosene

kiss it on the lips

and watch it

turn to ash

theres always more than one way

to cross the water

sing to us

the one with violets in her lap

dont let a king

or a prince

or a fairytale

tell you you are smaller than that or who you are meant to be

i sent my soul through the invisible

some letter of that afterlife to spell

and by and by my soul returnd to me

and answerd i myself am heavn and hell

there is a time for reciting poems and a time for fists

how to be a poet

to remind myself

make a place to sit down

sit down be quiet

you must depend upon

skill—more of each

than you have—inspiration

to eternity…

breathe with unconditional breath

the unconditioned air

stay away from screens

stay away from anything

that obscures the place it is in

there are no unsacred places

there are only sacred places

and desecrated places

accept what comes from silence

make the best you can of it

of the little words that come

out of the silence like prayers

prayed back to the one who prays

make a poem that does not disturb

the silence from which it came

i knew it was over

when tonight you couldnt make the phone ring

when you used to make the sun rise

when trees used to throw themselves

in front of you

to be paper for love letters

that was how i knew i had to do it

swaddle the kids we never had

against januarys cold slice

bundle them in winter

clothes they never needed

so i could drop them off at my moms

even though she lives on the other side of the country

and at this late west coast hour is

her house was lit like a candle

the way homes should be

warm and golden

and home

and the kids ran in

and jumped at the bichon frise

that she never had

they hugged the dog

it wriggled

and the kids were happy

yours and mine

the ones we never had

and my mom was

grand maternal which is to say with style

that only comes when youve seen

enough to know grace

like when to pretend its christmas or

a birthday so

she lit her voice with tiny

lights and pretended

she didnt see me crying

as i drove away

to the hotel connected to the bar

where i ordered the cheapest whisky they had

just because it shares your first name

because they dont make a whisky

and i only thought what i got

was what

i toasted the hangover

inevitable as sun

that used to rise

in your name

i toasted the carnivals

we never went to

and the things you never won

for me

the ferris wheels we never

kissed on and all the dreams

between us

that sat there

like balloons on a carneys board

waiting to explode with passion

but slowly deflated

under the pin

heads down

when it doesnt

after too many cheap

too many sweet

too much

sick like the smell of cheap

like the smell of

the dead

like the cheap dead flowers

you never sent

that i never threw

out of the window

she lends her pen

to thoughts of him

that flow from it

in her solitary

for she is his poet

and he is her poetry

i see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges

i see my father strolling out

under the ochre sandstone arch the

plates of blood behind his head i

see my mother with a few light books at her hip

standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks with the

wroughtiron gate still open behind her its

swordtips black in the may air

they are about to graduate they are about to get married

they are kids they are dumb all they know is they are

innocent they would never hurt anybody

i want to go up to them and say stop

dont do itshes the wrong woman

hes the wrong man you are going to do things

you cannot imagine you would ever do

you are going to do bad things to children

you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of

you are going to want to die i want to go

up to them there in the late may sunlight and say it

her hungry pretty blank face turning to me

his arrogant handsome blind face turning to me

his pitiful beautiful untouched body

but i dont do it i want to live i

take them up like the male and female

paper dolls and bang them together

at the hips like chips of flint as if to

strike sparks from them i say

do what you are going to do and i will tell about it

you look at me like an emergency

she wore the moonlight like lingerie

poetry is the synthesis of hyacinths and biscuits

to risk life to save a smile on a face of a woman or a child is the secret of chivalry

beloved gaze in thine own heart

the holy tree is growing there

from joy the holy branches start

and all the trembling flowers they bear

the changing colours of its fruit

have dowered the stars with merry light

the surety of its hidden root

has planted quiet in the night

the shaking of its leafy head

has given the waves their melody

and made my lips and music wed

murmuring a wizard song for thee

there the loves a circle go

the flaming circle of our days

gyring spiring to and fro

in those great ignorant leafy ways

remembering all that shaken hair

and how the wingèd sandals dart

beloved gaze in thine own heart

gaze no more in the bitter glass

the demons with their subtle guile

lift up before us when they pass

or only gaze a little while

for there a fatal image grows

that the stormy night receives

broken boughs and blackened leaves

for all things turn to barrenness

in the dim glass the demons hold

the glass of outer weariness

made when god slept in times of old

there through the broken branches go

the ravens of unresting thought

flying crying to and fro

cruel claw and hungry throat

or else they stand and sniff the wind

and shake their ragged wings alas

thy tender eyes grow all unkind

gaze no more in the bitter glass

the two trees

butto sing

to dream to smile to walk to be alone be free

with a voice that stirs and an eye that still can see

to cock your hat to one side when you please

at a yes a no to fight or make poetry

to work without a thought of fame or fortune

on that journey that you dream of to the moon

never to write a line thats not your own

wake for the sun who scatterd into flight

the stars before him from the field of night

drives night along with them from heavn

and strikes

the sultans turret with a shaft of light

the stars are forth the moon above the tops

of the snowshining mountains—beautiful

i linger yet with nature for the night

hath been to me a more familiar face

than that of man and in her starry shade

of dim and solitary loveliness

i learnd the language of another world

and yet a woman

and transforming it into triumph

in the bleak midwinter

earth stood hard as iron

in the bleak midwinter

look the trees

are turning

their own bodies

into pillars

are giving off the rich

and fulfillment

the long tapers

are bursting and floating away over

the blue shoulders

of the ponds

and every pond

no matter what its

nameless now

in my lifetime

leads back to this the fires

and the black river of loss

whose other side

none of us will ever know

to live in this world

you must be able

to do three things

to love what is mortal

to hold it

against your bones knowing

your own life depends on it

and when the time comes to let it go

to let it go

there are some poems

that we leave behind

some that leave us behind

while some just live

in the heart

and are reborn

when you smile again

that everything in the world is here in my room

in a great closet named and orderly

and i am here too in front of it

hardly able to see for the flash and the brightness—

and sometimes i am that madcap person clapping my hands and singing

and sometimes i am that quiet person down on my knees

i still have everything you gave me

it is dusty on the edges

it is slightly rotten

i guard it without thinking

i focus on it once a year

when i shake it out in the wind

i do not ache

i would not trade

ive got mixed feelings about poetry cause done well poetry is fantastic but not many people are capable of doing it well i think you should have some kind of license to perform poetry a poetic license perhaps

thing were falling apart we just could not slow down we were evolving into something greater perhaps too much for our own good and one thing always remained as i moved on i saved a little bit of love just in case you would ever return home

and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting

on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door

and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming

and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor

and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor

shall be lifted — nevermore

that stone buddha deserves all the

birdshit it gets

i wave my skinny arms like a tall

flower in the wind

the prettiest girls shine brightest in the dark

i can barely conceive a type of beauty in which there is no melancholy

dont be afraid to be afraid

have fear and then conquer the

shit out of it

we never know how high we are

till we are called to rise

and then if we are true to plan

our statures touch the skies

the heroism we recite

would be a daily thing

did not ourselves the cubits warp

for fear to be a king

i am not sure that the discovery of love is necessarily more exquisite than the discovery of poetry

i really dont know what i love you means

i think it means dont leave me here alone

ima freak user of words not a poet

an oak tree and a rosebush grew

young and green together

talking the talk of growing things

wind and water and weather

and while the rosebush sweetly bloomed

the oak tree grew so high

that now it spoke of newer things

eagles mountain peaks and sky

i guess you think youre pretty great

the rose was heard to cry

screaming as loud as it possibly could

to the treetop in the sky

and now you have no time for flower talk

now that youve grown so tall

its not so much that ive grown said the tree

its just that youve stayed so small

take away love and our earth is a tomb

the intensity

in your eyes

burns my pen

as i write

by a route obscure and lonely

haunted by ill angels only

where an eidolon named night

i have reached these lands but newly

from an ultimate dim thule

from a wild weird clime that lieth sublime

out of space out of time

are sometimes as dangerous

as a sliver of the moon

hinged to forgetfulness like a door

she slowly closed out of sight

and she was the woman i loved

but too many times she slept like

a mechanical deer in my caresses

and i ached in the metal silence

of her dreams

i once broke up with a boy because he wrote me an awful poem

it is strange how a scrap of poetry works in the mind and makes the legs move in time to it along the road

you shall create beauty not to excite the senses

but to give sustenance to the soul

i believe in the flesh and the appetites

seeing hearing feeling are miracles and each part and tag of me is a miracle

divine am i inside and out and i make holy whatever i touch or am touch’d from

the scent of these armpits aroma finer than prayer

this head more than churches bibles and all the creeds

a certain person wondered why

a big strong girl like me

wouldnt keep a job

which paid a normal salary

i took my time to lead her

and to read her every page

cant survive on minimal wage

a certain person wondered why

i wait all week for you

i didnt have the words

to describe just what you do

i said you had the motion

of the ocean in your walk

and when you solve my riddles

you dont even have to talk

your smile

is the ultimate

all the poems

in the world

are waking up from

one missed shot one and only chance

life is allbut one fleeting glance

poetry is the language of intensity because we are going to die an expression of intensity is justified

love shall be our token love be yours and love be mine

are exciting

but so are roses

o its die we must but its live we can

and the marvel of earth and sun

is all for the joy of woman and man

and the longing that makes them one

our father who art in heaven

stay there

and well stay here on earth

which is sometimes so pretty

with its mysteries of new york

and its mysteries of paris

at least as good as that of the trinity

with its little canal at ourcq

its great wall of china

its river at morlaix

its candy canes

with its pacific ocean

and its two basins in the tuileries

with its good children and bad people

with all the wonders of the world

which are here

simply on the earth

offered to everyone

strewn about

wondering at the wonder of themselves

and daring not avow it

as a naked pretty girl dares not show herself

with the worlds outrageous misfortunes

which are legion

with legionaries

with torturers

with the masters of this world

the masters with their priests their traitors and their troops

with the seasons

with the years

with the pretty girls and with the old bastards

with the straw of misery rotting in the steel of cannons

i am

who is no longer

afraid to let the world

an ode to me

down down down into the darkness of the grave

gently they go the beautiful the tender the kind

quietly they go the intelligent the witty the brave

i know but i do not approve and i am not resigned

to find

the

like you

here is a story that’s stranger than strange

before we begin you may want to arrange

and maybe some cocoa and something to eat

i’ll warn you of course before we commence

my story is eerie and full of suspense

brimming with danger and narrow escapes

and creatures of many remarkable shapes

dragons and ogres and gorgons and more

and creatures you’ve not even heard of before

and faraway places there’s plenty of those

and menacing villains to tingle your toes

so ready your mettle and steady your heart

it’s time for my story’s mysterious start

that sadness that you do not speak of

that haunts you in the ache of midnight

give it to me

i want to heal that

you have played

and broke the toys you were fondest of

and are a little tired now

tired of things that break and—

just tired

so am i

the visible reminder of invisible light

i will love you forever swears the poet i find this easy to swear too i will love you at  pm next tuesday  is that still as easy

a book of verses underneath the bough

a flask of wine a loaf of bread and thou

beside me singing in the wilderness

and wilderness is paradise now

for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams

of the beautiful annabel lee

and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes

of the beautiful annabel lee

and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side

of my darling my darling my life and my bride

in the sepulchre there by the sea

in her tomb by the sounding sea

i have stretched ropes from steeple to steeple garlands from window to window golden chains from star to star  and i dance

alone alone all all alone

and never a saint took pity on

my soul in agony

i am ashamed of my century but i have to smile

like beautiful bodies of the dead who had not grown old

and they shut them with tears in a brilliant mausoleum

with roses at the head and jasmine at the feet

this is what desires resemble that have passed

without fulfillment without any of them having achieved

a night of sensual delight or a morning of brightness

writing then was a substitute for myself if you dont love me love my writing  love me for my writing it is also much more a way of ordering and reordering the chaos of experience

you must burn burn higher

burn for everything you have ever wanted for everything you have ever lost for every crack in your heart and every fraction of every irreplaceable moment

burn as fast and as long as you can

you must burn burn higher

because nothing in this world will kill you faster than a dying fire

release the toxic and infectious

and poisonous liars

awaken from the hallucinations

and take back your heart

reclaim your selfesteem

and leave the toxic be

if i am more alive because love burns and chars me

as a fire given wood or wind feels new elation

its that he who lays me low is my salvation

and invigorates the more the more he scars me

down with hell and heaven and all the religious fuss

infinity pleased our parents

the rider

a boy told me

if he rollerskated fast enough

his loneliness couldnt catch up to him

the best reason i ever heard

for trying to be a champion

what i wonder tonight

pedaling hard down king william street

is if it translates to bicycles

a victory to leave your loneliness

panting behind you on some street corner

while you float free into a cloud of sudden azaleas

pink petals that have never felt loneliness

no matter how slowly they fell

we got dressed and showed the house

you live well the visitor said

the slum must be inside you

i feel there is an angel in me shed say

whom i am

unasked unsought love gives itself but is not bought

the war to preserve the privilege of mythmaking

one need not be a chamber — to be haunted —

one need not be a house —

the brain has corridors — surpassing

times change as do our wills what we are  is ever changing all the world is made of change and forever attaining new qualities

if my poetry aims to achieve anything its to deliver people from the limited ways in which they see and feel

into my heart an air that kills

from yon far country blows

what are those blue remembered hills

what spires what farms are those

that is the land of lost content

i see it shining plain

the happy highways where i went

and cannot come again

so the freshness lives on

in the sweetsmelling house of the rind

the proportions arcane and acerb

the profoundest of all sensualities

is the sense of truth

and the next deepest sensual experience

is the sense of justice

by those who ne’er succeed

to comprehend a nectar

all those other girls are cakeim crème brûléetiramisu if you will just a few notches above

the beautiful thing

about young love

is the truth

in our hearts

that it will last forever

but writing poems and letters doesnt seem to do much good

beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll

charms strike the sight but merit wins the soul

so come to the pond

or the river of your imagination

or the harbor of your longing

and put your lips to the world

and live

your life

when from our better selves we have too long

been parted by the hurrying world and droop

sick of its business of its pleasures tired

how gracious how benign is solitude

out of love

no regrets

though the goodness

be wasted forever

out of love

no regrets

though the return

be never

i choose to love this time for once

with all my intelligence

from splittings

come back so i can say yes this time do it again now that i know what to call what you did

this time ill be ready i like it rough now and im done with romance i never met another man who loved me so much at first sight he had to hurt me to do it

if you only write when inspired you may be a fairly decent poet but youll never be a novelist

exhaust the little moment soon it dies

and be it gash or gold it will not come

again in this identical disguise

id rather be thin than famous

but im fat

paste that in your broadway show

my heart

im not going to cry all the time

nor shall i laugh all the time

i dont prefer one strain to another

id have the immediacy of a bad movie

not just a sleeper but also the big

i want to be at least as alive as the vulgar and if some aficionado of my mess says thats not like frank all to the good i dont wear brown and grey suits all the time do i no i wear workshirts to the opera

often i want my feet to be bare

i want my face to be shaven and my heartyou cant plan on the heart but

the better part of it my poetry is open

thats not a run in your stocking its a hand on your leg

ask him why there are hypocrites in the world

because it is hard to bear the happiness of others

when are we happy

when we desire nothing and realize that possession is only momentary and so are forever playing

what is regret

to realize that one has spent ones life worrying about the future

what is sorrow

to long for the past

what is the highest pleasure

to hear a good story

how dull it is to pause to make an end

to rust unburnish’d not to shine in use

as tho’ to breathe were life

used to be he

was my hearts desire

his forthright gaze

his expert hands

id lie on the couch with my eyes

closed just thinking about it

never about the fact

that everything changes

that even this

my best passion

would not be immune

no i would bask on in an

eternal daydream of the hands

finding me the gaze like a winding

stair coaxing me down

until i caught a glimpse

of something in the mirror

silly girl in her lingerie

dancing with the furniture

a hot little bundle flush with

cliches into that pair

of toobright eyes i looked

and saw myself and something else

he would never look that way

writing poetry and reading books causes brain damage

one should write only those books from whose absence one suffers in short the ones you want on your own desk

like a child who saves their favourite food on the plate for last i try to save all thoughts of you for the end of the day so i can dream with the taste of you on my tongue

how many people came and stayed a certain time

uttered light or dark speech that became part of you

like light behind windblown fog and sand

filtered and influenced by it until no part

remains that is surely you

these songs are not meant to be understood you understand

they are only meant to terrify  comfort

busy with the ugliness of the expensive success

we forget the easiness of free beauty

lying sad right around the corner

only an instant removed

unnoticed and squandered

the way we are living

timorous or bold

will have been our life

tell all the truth but tell it slant

with the need for the self in the time of another  i left my seaport grim and dear  knowing good work could be made  in the state governed by both hope and despair

come on up boys

im dead

what is the colour of christmas

the red of the toyshops on a dark winter’s afternoon

of father christmas and the robin’s breast

or green

green of holly and spruce and mistletoe in the house

fields of frost and snow

thus white green red reducing the event to the level of a chianti bottle

but many will say that the significant colour is gold

gold of fire and treasure of light in the winter dark and this gets closer

for the true colour of christmas is black

black of winter black of night black of frost and of the east wind

black of dangerous shadows beyond the firelight

lie beside me oh my beloved for thy thorns are more pleasurable than the petals of the world

hold me in thy arms of hope for the truth of separation can rest tonight

i celebrate myself and sing myself

and what i assume you shall assume

for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you

dreams books are each a world and books we know

are a substantial world both pure and good

round these with tendrils strong as flesh and blood

our pastime and our happiness will grow

the day is done

the day is done and the darkness

falls from the wings of night

as a feather is wafted downward

from an eagle in his flight

i see the lights of the village

gleam through the rain and the mist

and a feeling of sadness comes oer me

that my soul cannot resist

a feeling of sadness and longing

that is not akin to pain

and resembles sorrow only

as the mist resembles the rain

come read to me some poem

some simple and heartfelt lay

that shall soothe this restless feeling

and banish the thoughts of day

not from the grand old masters

not from the bards sublime

through the corridors of time

for like strains of martial music

their mighty thoughts suggest

lifes endless toil and endeavor

and tonight i long for rest

read from some humbler poet

whose songs gushed from his heart

as showers from the clouds of summer

or tears from the eyelids start

who through long days of labor

and nights devoid of ease

still heard in his soul the music

such songs have power to quiet

the restless pulse of care

and come like the benediction

that follows after prayer

then read from the treasured volume

the poem of thy choice

and lend to the rhyme of the poet

the beauty of thy voice

and the night shall be filled with music

and the cares that infest the day

shall fold their tents like the arabs

and as silently steal away

o stand stand at the window

as the tears scald and start

you shall love your crooked neighbour

with your crooked heart

now begins to rise in me the familiar rhythm words that have lain dormant now lift now toss their crests and fall and rise and falls again i am a poet yes surely i am a great poet

your father is dead

from his old coats

ill make you little jackets

ill make you little trousers

from his old pants

therell be in his pockets

things he used to put there

keys and pennies

covered with tobacco

dan shall have the pennies

to save in his bank

anne shall have the keys

to make a pretty noise with

anne eat your breakfast

i forget just why

if you only write when you’re inspired you may be a fairly decent poet but you’ll never be a novelist because you’re going to have to make your word count today and those words aren’t going to wait for you whether you’re inspired or not

the process of writing can be magical …mostly it’s a process of putting one word after another

anyone who says here’s my address

write me a poem deserves something in reply

so i’ll tell a secret instead

poems hide in the bottoms of our shoes

they are sleeping they are the shadows

drifting across our ceilings the moment

before we wake up what we have to do

is live in a way that lets us find them

the childrens hour

between the dark and the daylight

when the night is beginning to lower

comes a pause in the days occupations

that is known as the childrens hour

i hear in the chamber above me

the patter of little feet

the sound of a door that is opened

and voices soft and sweet

from my study i see in the lamplight

descending the broad hall stair

grave alice and laughing allegra

and edith with golden hair

a whisper and then a silence

yet i know by their merry eyes

they are plotting and planning together

to take me by surprise

a sudden rush from the stairway

a sudden raid from the hall

by three doors left unguarded

they enter my castle wall

they climb up into my turret

oer the arms and back of my chair

if i try to escape they surround me

they seem to be everywhere

they almost devour me with kisses

their arms about me entwine

till i think of the bishop of bingen

in his mousetower on the rhine

do you think o blueeyed banditti

because you have scaled the wall

such an old mustache as i am

is not a match for you all

i have you fast in my fortress

and will not let you depart

but put you down into the dungeon

in the roundtower of my heart

and there will i keep you forever

yes forever and a day

till the walls shall crumble to ruin

and moulder in dust away

i am in awe of flowers

not because of their colors

but because even though they

have dirt in their roots

they still grow

they still bloom

those ancients who in poetry presented

the golden age who sang its happy state

perhaps in their parnassus dreamt this place

here mankinds root was innocent and here

were every fruit and neverending spring

these streamsthe nectar of which poets sing

in my darkest night

when the moon was covered

and i roamed through wreckage

live in the layers

not on the litter

though i lack the art

to decipher it

no doubt the next chapter

in my book of transformations

i am not done with my changes

you were the hardest year of my life and i’ve never been so happy what does that say about me

nothing like poetry when you lie awake at night it keeps the old brain limber it washes away the mud and sand that keeps on blocking up the bends

like waves to make the pebbles dance on my old floors and turn them into rubies and jacinths or at any rate good imitations

they will tell you home is safe zone

no bitch face is safe zone

bitch face is cutting off the ladder

willing to burn in the apartment

if it means he cant get in

while the scientist sees everything that happens in one point of space

the poet feels everything that happens in one point of time

darkling i listen and for many a time

i have been half in love with easeful death

everything is all right

when you’re here

when you’re right next to me

when my hand is in yours

don’t leave me

don’t leave me empty handed

if you hold this

up to the sky

it will shine a billion

painted from the tears

of the most high

plucked from the lush gardens

look inside this hypnotic gem

and a kaleidoscope of

sights and colors

will tease and seduce

your eyes and mind

have you ever heard

hold your ear

to this mystical stone

and you will hear

to the vibrations

of the perfumed

my whole being is a dark chant

that will carry you perpetuating you

to the dawn of eternal growths and blossomings

in this chant i sighed you oh

in this chant

i grafted you to the tree to the water to the fire

you must be careful not to deprive the poem of its wild origin

at first first nothing will happen to us

and later on

it will happen to us again

poetrys work is the clarification and magnification of being

blessing the boats

at saint mary’s

may the tide

that is entering even now

the lip of our understanding

carry you out

beyond the face of fear

may you kiss

the wind then turn from it

certain that it will

love your back

may you

open your eyes to water

and may you in your innocence

sail through this to that

hearts rebuilt from hope resurrect dreams killed by hate

at two oclock in the morning if you open your window and listen

you will hear the feet of the wind that is going to call the sun

and the trees in the shadow rustle and the trees in the moonlight glisten

and though it is deep dark night you feel that the night is done

i aspire to be

with an old wife

from a wild youth

for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams

of the beautiful annabel lee

and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes

of the beautiful annabel lee

she needed the chaos within her in order to discover the extraordinary no man could ever reach

twas the night before thanksgiving

all the foods in the oven

and im in the bedroom performin self lovin

books are carefully folded forestsvoid of autumnbound from the sun

returning to the bough i thought

but no a butterfly

and medecine law business engineering these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life but poetry beauty romance love these are what we stay alive for

our two souls therefore which are one

though i must go endure not yet

a breach but an expansion

like gold to aery thinness beat

if they be two they are two so

as stiff twin compasses are two

thy soul the fixd foot makes no show

to move but doth if th other do

and though it in the centre sit

yet when the other far doth roam

it leans and hearkens after it

and grows erect as that comes home

such wilt thou be to me who must

like th other foot obliquely run

thy firmness makes my circle just

and makes me end where i begun

i have been happy though in a dream

i have been happyand i love the theme

dreams in their vivid colouring of life

as in that fleeting shadowy misty strife

i found the poems in the fields

and only wrote them down

a grain of poetry suffices to season a century

great poetry needs no interpreter other than a responsive heart

i saw above a sea of hills

and there was no one near or far

to keep the world from being mine

no man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge

where music thundered let the mind be still

where the will triumphed let there be no will

what light revealed now let the dark fulfill

a tough life needs a tough language—and that is what poetry is that is what literature offers—a language powerful enough to say how it is

tears and sighs when the hero dies

but the curtain fall is final

when in life we take the tragic way

the sunset too is a glorious thing

but with it ends the day

reading someones poetry is like seeing them naked davis pritchett

i do believe in poetry i believe that there are creatures endowed with the power to put things together and bring them back to life

and midtime of night

and stars in their orbits

shone pale thro the light

of the brighter cold moon

herself in the heavens

her beam on the waves

on her cold smile

too cold–too cold for me

there passd as a shroud

and i turned away to thee

and dearer thy beam shall be

for joy to my heart

is the proud part

thou bearest in heaven at night

and more i admire

than that colder lowly light

im like the weather never really can predict when this rain clouds gonna burst when its the high or its the low when you might need a light jacket

sometimes im the slush that sticks to the bottom of your work pants but i can easily be the melting snowflakes clinging to your long lashes

i know that some people like

sunny and seventyfive

sunny and seventyfive

sunny and seventyfive

but you take me as i am and never

forget to pack an umbrella

filled with

because they have

nothing to say

with a grimace

painted on them

are we stuck on hold

expecting our turn

of socalled

pensive they sit and roll their languid eyes

i’ll always deny that i kissed her

i was just whispering into her mouth

and they will say yes yes you i will go there with you i have been waiting for this

and it was at that age poetry arrived

in search of me i don’t know i don’t know where

it came from from winter or a river

i don’t know how or when

no they were not voices they were not

words nor silence

but from a street i was summoned

from the branches of night

abruptly from the others

or returning alone

there i was without a face

and it touched me

i did not know what to say my mouth

had no way

with names

my eyes were blind

and something started in my soul

fever or forgotten wings

and i made my own way

that fire

and i wrote the first faint line

of someone who knows nothing

and suddenly i saw

the heavens

and open

with arrows fire and flowers

the winding night the universe

and i infinitesimal being

drunk with the great starry

i felt myself a pure part

of the abyss

i wheeled with the stars

my heart broke free on the open sky

if you do not even understand what words say

how can you expect to pass judgement

on what words conceal

a man who knows how little he knows is well a man who knows how much he knows is sick if when you see the symptoms you can tell your cure is quick

a sound man knows that sickness makes him sick and before he catches it his cure is quick

my love runs by like a day in june

and he makes no friends of sorrows

hell tread his galloping rigadoon

in the pathway of the morrows

hell live his days where the sunbeams start

nor could storm or wind uproot him

my own dear love he is all my heart

and i wish somebodyd shoot him

dont you know no one can escape

the power of creatures reaching out

with breath alone

everyone mourns the first blossom

who will grieve the rest who fall

you are ice and fire

the touch of you burns my hands like snow

for books are more than books they are the life

the very heart and core of ages past

the reason why men lived and worked and died

the essence and quintessence of their lives

when you write about what you dream you become a writer

when you dream about what you write you become haunted by a curse

and even yet i dare not let it languish

dare not indulge in memory’s rapturous pain

once drinking deep of that divinest anguish

how could i seek the empty world again

so much of the world is plunged in darkness and chaos

so ring the bells that still can ring

forget your perfect offering

there is a crack in everything

that’s how the light gets in

the grass as bristly and stout as chives and me wondering when the ground will break and me wondering how anything fragile survives

i see your picture and in that picture i didnt see you

gains for all our losses

there are gains for all our losses

there are balms for all our pains

but when youth the dream departs

it takes some thing from our hearts

and never comes again

we are stronger and are better

under manhood’s sterner reign

still we feel that some thing sweet

followed youth with flying feet

and will never come again

some thing beautiful has vanished

and we sigh for it in vain

we behold it every where

on the earth and in the air

but it never comes again

who could have foretold

the heart grows old

from touching others

for the first time on the road north of tampico

i felt the life sliding out of me

a drum in the desert harder and harder to hear

i was seven i lay in the car

past the glass

my stomach was a melon split wide inside my skin

how do you know if you are going to die

i begged my mother

we had been traveling for days

with strange confidence she answered

when you can no longer make a fist

years later i smile to think of that journey

the borders we must cross separately

stamped with our unanswerable woes

i who did not die who am still living

still lying in the backseat behind all my questions

clenching and opening one small hand

i thought my fireplace dead

and stirred the ashes

i burned my fingers

if you are of the opinion that the contemplation of suicide is sufficient evidence of a poetic nature do not forget that actions speak louder than words

walk the plank says pirate jim

but captain jim i cannot swim

then you must steer us through the gale

but captain jim i cannot sail

then down with the galley slaves you go

but captain jim i cannot row

then you must be the pirates clerk

but captain jim i cannot work

and marbled clouds go scudding by

the manysteepled london sky

icarus should have waited for nightfall

the moon would have never let him go

for of all sad words of tongue or pen

the saddest are these it might have been

love be

as the flickering

as the fullyawoken

as my blanket

to illuminate a hundred

and just small enough to fit

into my embrace

tell me not in mournful numbers

life is but an empty dream

for the soul is dead that slumbers

and things are not what they seem

in visions of the night like dropping rain

descend the many memories of pain

she was everything real in a world of makebelieve

i am sore wounded but not slain

i will lay me down and bleed a while

and then rise up to fight again

fare well we call to hearth and hall

though wind may blow and rain may fall

we must away ere break of day

over the wood and mountain tall

to rivendell where elves yet dwell

in glades beneath the misty fell

through moor and waste we ride in haste

and wither then we cannot tell

with foes ahead behind us dread

beneath the sky shall be our bed

until at last our toil be sped

our journey done our errand sped

we must away we must away

we ride before the break of day

even this late it happens

the coming of love the coming of light

shower your head with flowers

and anoint your feet with my tears

for i know i have caused you

so much heartache frustration and despair –

throughout my youthful years

i wish i could give you

the remainder of my life

to add to yours

or simply erase

the lines on your face

and mend all that has been torn

for next to god

you are the fire

that has given light

to the flame in each of my eyes

you are the fountain

that nourished my growth

and from your chalice –

without the wetness of your love

the fragrance of your water

or the trickling sounds of

your voice

the arrow and the song

i shot an arrow into the air

it fell to earth i knew not where

for so swiftly it flew the sight

could not follow it in its flight

i breathed a song into the air

it fell to earth i knew not where

for who has sight so keen and strong

that it can follow the flight of song

long long afterward in an oak

i found the arrow still unbroke

and the song from beginning to end

i found again in the heart of a friend

be good to yourself

youre the only you

youll ever get

he drove his mind into the abyss where poetry is written

i lock my door upon myself

and bar them out but who shall wall

self from myself most loathed of all

it was not death for i stood up

and all the dead lie down

it was not night for all the bells

put out their tongues for noon

it was not frost for on my flesh

nor fire for just my marble feet

and yet it tasted like them all

the figures i have seen

as if my life were shaven

and fitted to a frame

and could not breathe without a key

and i was like midnight some

when everything that ticked has stopped

and space stares all around

or grisly frosts first autumn morns

repeal the beating ground

but most like chaosstopless cool

without a chance or spar

or even a report of land

to justify despair

good poetry makes the universe reveal a secret

eyes that commit that is what i am looking for

isn’t it time that these most ancient sorrows of ours

grew fruitful time that we tenderly loosed ourselves

from the loved one and unsteadily survived

the way the arrow suddenly all vector survives the string

to be more than itself for abiding is nowhere

oh kangaroos sequins chocolate sodas  you really are beautiful pearls  harmonicas jujubes aspirins

in the muscle you

as bone hugs the ache home so

im vexed to love you your body

the shape of returns your hair a torso

of light your heat

i must have your opening

id eat each moment

of that softfinned fruit

inverted fountain in which i dont see me

because with alarming accuracy

she’d been identifying patterns

i was unaware of—this tic that

tendency like the way ive mastered

the language of intimacy

in order to conceal how i felt—

i knew i was in danger

of being terribly understood

every word was once a poem

it was many and many a year ago

in a kingdom by the sea

that a maiden there lived whom you may know

by the name of annabel lee

and this maiden she lived with no other thought

than to love and be loved by me

i was a child and she was a child

in this kingdom by the sea

but we loved with a love that was more than love

i and my annabel lee

with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven

coveted her and me

and this was the reason that long ago

in this kingdom by the sea

a wind blew out of a cloud chilling

my beautiful annabel lee

so that her highborn kinsman came

and bore her away from me

to shut her up in a sepulchre

in this kingdom by the sea

the angels not half so happy in heaven

went envying her and me

yes that was the reason as all men know

in this kingdom by the sea

that the wind came out of the cloud by night

chilling and killing my annabel lee

but our love it was stronger by far than the love

of those who were older than we

of many far wiser than we

and neither the angels in heaven above

nor the demons down under the sea

can ever dissever my soul from the soul

of the beautiful annabel lee

for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams

of the beautiful annabel lee

and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes

of the beautiful annabel lee

and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side

of my darling my darling my life and my bride

in the sepulchre there by the sea

in her tomb by the sounding sea

it was many and many a year ago

in a kingdom by the sea

that a maiden there lived whom you may know

by the name of annabel lee

and this maiden she lived with no other thought

than to love and be loved by me

i was a child and she was a child

since when he asked

are the first line and last line of any poem

where the poem begins and ends

darkling i listen and for many a time

i have been half in love with easeful death

calld him soft names in many a musèd rhyme

to take into the air my quiet breath

its very difficult to look at the world

and into your heart at the same time

in between a life has passed

how astonishing it is that language can almost mean

and frightening that it does not quite

he feeds upon her face by day and night

and she with true kind eyes looks back on him

fair as the moon and joyful as the light

not wan with waiting not with sorrow dim

not as she is but was when hope shone bright

not as she is but as she fills his dream

as some strings untouched

sound when no one is speaking

so it was when love slipped inside us

title blue light lounge sutra for the performance poets at harold park hotel

the need gotta be

so deep words cant

all night long notes

stumble off the tongue

color the air indigo

so deep fragments of gut

flesh cling to the song

you gotta get into it

so deep salt crystalizes on eyelashes

the need gotta be

so deep you can vomit up ghosts

not feel broken

till you are no more

than a half ounce of gold

you gotta get into it

blow that saxophone

so deep all the sex  dope in this world

cant erase your need

to howl against the sky

the need gotta be

so deep you cant

just wiggle your hips

rise up out of it

chaos in the cosmos

modern man in the pepperpot

you gotta get hooked

into every hungry groove

so deep the bomb locked

into it into it so deep

the need gotta be basic

animal need to see

know the terror

we are made of honey

cause if you wanna dance

this boogie be ready

to let the devil use your head

for a drum

a lover goes toward his beloved as enthusiastically as a schoolboy leaving his books but when he leaves his girlfriend he feels as miserable as the schoolboy on his way to school act  scene

poetry resembles metaphysics one does not mind ones own but one does not like anyone elses

i wrote so meagerly to you but what i couldnt write

swelled and swelled like an oldfashioned airship

and drifted away at last through the night sky

self love is an ocean

and your heart is a vessel make it full

and any excess will spill over

into the lives of the people

you hold dear but you must come first

i am a work in progress

we are all born free

and spend a lifetime

to our own

you will come away bruised

you will come away bruised

but this will give you poetry

when no one is looking

i swallow deserts and clouds

and chew on mountains

knowing they are sweet bones

when no one is looking

and i want to kiss god

i just lift my own hand to my mouth

its dark and i’m reading my scars because our moments remind me of where i should be

and must i then indeed pain live with you

all through my lifesharing my fire my bed

sharingoh worst of all thingsthe same head

and when i feed myself feeding you too

this poetry i never know what im going to say

i dont plan it

when im outside the saying of it

i get very quiet and rarely speak at all

write of it sob your heart out sing

while torrential slush that roars

burns in the blackness of the spring

go hire a buggy for six grivnas

race through the noice of bells and wheels

to where the ink and all you grieving

are muffled when the rainshower falls

to where like pears burnt black as charcoal

a myriad rooks plucked from the trees

fall down into the puddles hurl

dry sadness deep into the eyes

below the wet black earth shows through

with sudden cries the wind is pitted

the more haphazard the more true

the poetry that sobs its heart out

so much depends

glazed with rain

beside the white

the first rose on my rosetree

budded bloomed and shattered

during sad days when to me

grief of grief has drained me clean

still it seems a pity

no one saw—it must have been

very pretty

when you cried i learned what helplessness tastes like because all i could do was swallow

but far more numerous was the herd of such

who think too little and who talk too much

i wander thro each charterd street

near where the charterd thames does flow

and mark in every face i meet

the mindforgd manacles i hear

how the chimneysweepers cry

and the hapless soldiers sigh

runs in blood down palace walls

but most thro midnight streets i hear

how the youthful harlots curse

blasts the newborn infants tear

and blights with plagues the marriage hearse

your war drum aint  louder than this breath

what youth deemed crystal age finds out was dew

cut my life into pizzas this is my plastic fork oven baking no breathing dont give a fuck if its carbs that im eating catherine spann

reminiscing in the drizzle of portland i notice the ring that’s landed on your finger a massive

insect of glitter a chandelier shining at the end

of a long tunnel thirteen years ago you hid the hurt

in your voice under a blanket and said there’s two kinds

of women—those you write poems about

and those you don’t it’s true i never brought you

a bouquet of sonnets or served you haiku in bed

my idea of courtship was tapping jane’s addiction

lyrics in morse code on your window at three am

whiskey doing pushups on my breath but i worked

within the confines of my character cast

as the bad boy in your life the magellan

of your dark side we don’t have a past so much

as a bunch of electricity and liquor power

never put to good use what we had together

makes it sound like a virus as if we caught

one another like colds and desire was merely

a symptom that could be treated with soup

and lots of sex gliding beside you now

i feel like the benjamin franklin of monogamy

as if i invented it but i’m still not immune

to your waterfall scent still haven’t developed

antibodies for your smile i don’t know how long

regret existed before humans stuck a word on it

i don’t know how many paper towels it would take

to wipe up the pacific ocean or why the light

of a candle being blown out travels faster

than the luminescence of one that’s just been lit

but i do know that all our huffing and puffing

into each other’s ears—as if the brain was a trick

birthday candle—didn’t make the silence

any easier to navigate i’m sorry all the kisses

i scrawled on your neck were written

in disappearing ink sometimes i thought of you

so hard one of your legs would pop out

of my ear hole and when i was sleeping you’d press

your face against the porthole of my submarine

i’m sorry this poem has taken thirteen years

to reach you i wish that just once instead of skidding

off the shoulder blade’s precipice and joyriding

over flesh we’d put our hands away like chocolate

to be saved for later and deciphered the calligraphy

of each other’s eyelashes translated a paragraph

from the volumes of what couldn’t be said

i am suggesting that the radical of poetry lies not in the

resolution of doubts but in their proliferation

there has fallen a splendid tear

from the passionflower at the gate

she is coming my dove my dear

she is coming my life my fate

the red rose cries she is near she is near

and the white rose weeps she is late

the larkspur listens i hear i hear

and the lily whispers i wait

she is coming my own my sweet

were it ever so airy a tread

my heart would hear her and beat

were it earth in an earthy bed

my dust would hear her and beat

had i lain for a century dead

would start and tremble under her feet

and blossom in purple and red

its important to have your private enjoyments because sometimes thats all we have

doesn’t everyone want to feel in the night

the beloved body compass polestar

to hear the quiet breathing that says

i am alive that means also

you are alive because you hear me

you are here with me

every poem that ive created was yours i thought they were mine but they were yours and i wish i couldve kept them and i wish i couldve kept you

so the threads intertwine

such beauty and grace

ughh look at the spider

suck out that bugs juices

catch and carry

ash and ember

ash and oak

bide and borrow

stone and stave

wind and water

catch and carry

ash and ember

ash and oak

bide and borrow

stone and stave

wind and water

results and roses

the man who wants a garden fair

or small or very big

with flowers growing here and there

must bend his back and dig

the things are mighty few on earth

that wishes can attain

weve got to work to gain

it matters not what goal you seek

its secret here reposes

youve got to dig from week to week

to get results or roses

poetry is nearer to vital truth than history

if we surrendered

to earth’s intelligence

we could rise up rooted like trees

instead we entangle ourselves

in knots of our own making

and struggle lonely and confused

so like children we begin again

to fall

patiently to trust our heaviness

even a bird has to do that

before he can fly

i once knew a girl

who would just stand there and stare

at anyone or anything

she seemed not to care

shed stare at the ground

shed stare at the sky

shed stare at you for hours

and youd never know why

but after winning the local staring contest

she finally gave her eyes

how does the ordinary person come to the transcendent for a start i would say study poetry learn how to read a poem you need not have the experience to get the message or at least some indication of the message it may come gradually

what wretched poverty of language to compare stars to diamonds

i regret to say im

unable to reply to your unexpressed desires

why cant poets just say what they want to say and then shut up

the rain set early in tonight

the sullen wind was soon awake

it tore the elmtops down for spite

and did its best to vex the lake

i listened with heart fit to break

when glided in porphyria straight

she shut the cold out and the storm

and kneeled and made the cheerless grate

blaze up and all the cottage warm

errors like straws upon the surface flow

he who would search for pearls must dive below

thus though we cannot make our sun

stand still yet we will make him run

its a

one difference between poetry and lyrics is that lyrics sort of fade into the background they fade on the page and live on the stage when set to music

my soul is wrapped in harsh repose

but soft behold

my heart expands

tis grown a bulge in it

inspired by your beauty

i think we are in rats’ alley

where the dead men lost their bones

this must crush my spirit now

yet i bore it and am bearing

only do not ask me how

safe upon the solid rock the ugly houses stand

come and see my shining palace built upon the sand

dive like an eagle

aint no bird thats my equal

free verse is like free love it is a contradiction in terms

tonight i saw myself in the dark window as

the image of my father whose life

was spent like this

thinking of death to the exclusion

of other sensual matters

so in the end that life

was easy to give up since

it contained nothing even

my mothers voice couldnt make him

change or turn back

as he believed

that once you cant love another human being

you have no place in the world

love said wake still and think of me

sleep close your eyes till break of day

but dreams came by and smilingly

gave both to love and sleep their way

who you are contributes to your poetry in a number of important ways but you shouldnt identify with your poems so closely that when they are cut youre the one that bleeds

i see a bright

under the overhead light

that shades into

and then into darker

and i cant see beyond that

and wonder dread and war

have lingered in that land

where loss and love in turn

have held the upper hand

girl they cant understand you

you rise from the asheap in a blaze

and only then do they recognize you

as their one true love

while you pray beneath your mothers

tree you carrve a phoenix into your palm

wth aa hazel twig and coal

every night she devours more of you

you used to believe in angels

now you believe in the makeover

if you cant get the grime off your face

and your foot into a size six heel

who will ever bother to notice you

the kettle and the broom sear in your grasp

snap into fragments the turtledoves sing

theres blood within the shoe

you deserve the palace you think as you signal

the pigeons to attack approve the barrel filled with redhot nails

its great hearth beckons and the princes flag

rises crimson in the angry sun

he will love you for the heat you generate

for the flames you ignite around you

though he encase your tiny feet in glass

to keep them from scorching the ground

they say that time assuages—

time never did assuage

an actual suffering strengthens

as sinews do with age

time is a test of trouble

but not a remedy

if such it prove it prove too

there was no malady

to meet an antique book

in just the dress his century wore

a privilege i think

his venerable hand to take

and warming in our own

a passage back or two to make

to times when he was young

his quaint opinions to inspect

his knowledge to unfold

on what concerns our mutual mind

the literature of old

there are so many days

when living stops and pulls up and sits

and waits like a train on the rails

this fire that we call loving is too strong for human minds but just right for human souls

puts all heaven in a rage

a dove house fill’d with doves and pigeons

shudders hell thro’ all its regions

a dog starv’d at his master’s gate

predicts the ruin of the state

a horse misus’d upon the road

calls to heaven for human blood

each outcry of the hunted hare

a fiber from the brain does tear

like poetry fashion does not state anything it merely suggests

one day when tenderness has become the single rule of the morning i will wake in your arms perhaps your skin will be overly gorgeous and the light will include the impossible understanding of love

to the edge of the precipice

they stared in desire

at the naked abyss

if you love me said mind

take that step into silence

if you love me said body

turn and exist

john keats  john keats  john  please put your scarf on

when i was oneandtwenty

when i was oneandtwenty

give crowns and pounds and guineas

but not your heart away

give pearls away and rubies

but keep your fancy free

but i was oneandtwenty

no use to talk to me

when i was oneandtwenty

i heard him say again

the heart out of the bosom

tis paid with sighs a plenty

and sold for endless rue

and i am twoandtwenty

and oh tis true tis true

mr an mrs smith had a wonderful life

they were a normal happy husband and wife

one day they got news that made mr smith glad

mrs smith would would be a mom

which would make him the dad

but something was wrong with their bundle of joy

it wasnt human at all

it was a robot boy

he wasnt warm and cuddly

and he didnt have skin

instead there was a cold thin layer of tin

there were wires and tubes sticking out of his head

he just lay there and stared

not living or dead

the only time he seemed alive at all

was with a long extension cord

plugged into the wall

mr smith yelled at the doctor

what have you done to my boy

hes not flesh and blood

hes aluminum alloy

the doctor said gently

what im going to say

will sound pretty wild

but youre not the father

of this strange looking child

you see there still is some question

about the childs gender

but we think that its father

is a microwave blender

the smiths lives were now filled

with misery and strife

and he hated his wife

he never forgave her unholy alliance

with a kitchen appliance

and robot boy

grew to be a young man

though he was often mistaken

for a garbage can

my words are the garment of what i shall never be

like the tucked sleeve of a onearmed boy

i have been here before

but when or how i cannot tell

i know the grass beyond the door

the sweet keen smell

the sighing sound the lights around the shore

you have been mine before—

how long ago i may not know

but just when at that swallows soar

your neck turnd so

some veil did fall—i knew it all of yore

has this been thus before

and shall not thus times eddying flight

still with our lives our love restore

in deaths despite

and day and night yield one delight once more

so the nymphs they spoke

we kissed and laid

by noontime’s hour

our love was made

we lay entwined i laid with them

our breath one glassy tideless sea

our bodies draping wearily

we slept i slept so lucidly

with hopes to stay this memory

not everything can be felt and not everything will be ever understood

but it is good to be several floors up in the dead of night wondering whether you are any good or not and the only decision you can make is that you did it

o words are poor receipts for what time hath stole away

poetry is a rich fullbodied whistle cracked ice crunching in pails the night that numbs the leaf the duel of two nightingales the sweet pea that has run wild creations tears in shoulder blades

after great pain a formal feeling comes –

the stiff heart questions was it he that bore

and yesterday or centuries before

the feet mechanical go round –

of ground or air or ought –

this is the hour of lead –

remembered if outlived

as freezing persons recollect the snow –

first – chill – then stupor – then the letting go –

is the best of opiates

it kills the thoughts

that think about the thoughts

it is the best of opiates

so said maria

but too long in solitude shed dwelt

and too long her thoughts had felt

their strength so when the man drew near

out popped her thoughts and covered him with fear

better that she had kept her thoughts on a chain

for now shes alone again and all in pain

she sighs for the man that went and the thoughts that stay

to trouble her dreams by night and her dreams by day

this cruel age has deflected me

like a river from this course

strayed from its familiar shores

my changeling life has flowed

into a sister channel

how many spectacles ive missed

the curtain rising without me

and falling too how many friends

i never had the chance to meet

the true poem rests between the words

im pretty lost in becoming all this frost bitter like winter strungout like a string of pearls

i love to feel the temperature drop and the wind increase just before a thunderstorm then i climb in bed with the thunder

this week

events your eyes

all power can be

or alternating

you socket to me

plugged in and the grid

this electricity

strong enough to stop

or start it

again volt revolt

to life ive got my ion

you coppertop

so watch how you

conduct yourself

heres todays

darkness and youre

here fumbling for

that small switch

with an urgent surge

strong enough to kill

our darkened house

and here i am

tempest pouring out

of tsunami on the ground

ive got that rainsoaked kite

that drenched key

you know what its for

circuitbreaker you know

how to kiss until its hertz

one two and through and through

the vorpal blade went snickersnack

he left it dead and with its head

he went galumphing back

i like the posture but not the yoga

i like the inebriated morning but not the opium i like the flower but not the garden the moment but not the dream quiet my love be still i am sleeping

i want my own will and i want

simply to be with my will

as it goes toward action

and in the silent sometimes hardly moving times

when something is coming near

i want to be with those who know

secret things or else alone

i want to unfold

i don’t want to be folded anywhere

because where i am folded

there i am a lie

you will never be alone with a poet in your pocket

at the end of the day i went to this place where your memories left footsteps on my skin and the breath of your touch stained my desire yea it was one of those nights where i needed you the most

my silence knot is tied up in my hair as if to keep my love out of my eyes i cannot speak to one for whom i care a hatpin serves as part of my disguise

in the play my role is baticeer a word which here means person who trains bats the audience may feel a prick of fear as if sharp pins are hidden in thier hats

my costar lives on what we call a brae his solitude might not be just an act a piece of mail fails to arrive one day this poignant melodramas based on fact

the curtain falls just as the knot unties the silence is broken by the one who dies

a few drinks and the world was hers—

she wore her whiskey like a loaded gun

i am that last that

final thing the body

season of mists and mellow fruitfulness

close bosomfriend of the maturing sun

conspiring with him how to load and bless

with fruit the vines that round the thatcheves run

to bend with apples the moss’d cottagetrees

and fill all fruit with ripeness to the core

to swell the gourd and plump the hazel shells

with a sweet kernel to set budding more

and still more later flowers for the bees

until they think warm days will never cease

for summer has o’erbrimm’d their clammy cells

the coming of light

even this late it happens

the coming of love the coming of light

you wake and the candles are lit as if by themselves

stars gather dreams pour into your pillows

sending up warm bouquets of air

even this late the bones of the body shine

and tomorrow’s dust flares into breath

poetry is a lifecherishing force

i wanted the past to go away i wanted

to leave it like another country i wanted

my life to close and open

like a hinge like a wing like the part of the song

where it falls

down over the rocks an explosion a discovery

to hurry into the work of my life i wanted to know

whoever i was i was

for a little while

if you were to stand at night by the seashore with harris and say

hark do you not hear is it but the mermaids singing deep below the waving waters or sad spirits chanting dirges for white corpses held by seaweed harris would take you by the arm and say

i know what it is old man youve got a chill now you come along with me i know a place round the corner here where you can get a drop of the finest scotch whisky you ever tasted put you right in less than no time

harris always does know a place round the corner where you can get something brilliant in the drinking line i believe that if you met harris up in paradise supposing such a thing likely he would immediately greet you with

so glad youve come old fellow ive found a nice place round the corner here where you can get some really firstclass nectar

it is sweet to think i was a companion in an expedition that never ends

life is short though i keep this from my children

life is short and i’ve shortened mine

i’ll keep from my children the world is at least

fifty percent terrible and that’s a conservative

estimate though i keep this from my children

for every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird

for every loved child a child broken bagged

sunk in a lake life is short and the world

is at least half terrible and for every kind

stranger there is one who would break you

though i keep this from my children i am trying

to sell them the world any decent realtor

walking you through a real shithole chirps on

about good bones this place could be beautiful

right you could make this place beautiful

a precious mouldering pleasure ’t is

to meet an antique book

in just the dress his century wore

a privilege i think

art is long and time is fleeting

true and false fears let us refrain

let us love nobly and live and add again

years and years unto years till we attain

to write threescore this is the second of our reign

failure the renewable resource

trying too hard to be too good even when trying to be bad is too good for the bad too bad for the good

if you can not be a poet be the poem

it is always what is under pressure in us especially under pressure of concealmentthat explodes in poetry

when you are old

when you are old and grey and full of sleep

and nodding by the fire take down this book

and slowly read and dream of the soft look

your eyes had once and of their shadows deep

how many loved your moments of glad grace

and loved your beauty with love false or true

but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you

and loved the sorrows of your changing face

and bending down beside the glowing bars

murmur a little sadly how love fled

and paced upon the mountains overhead

and hid his face amid a crowd of stars

silence can be a plan

the blueprint to a life

it is a presence

it has a history a form

do not confuse it

with any kind of absence

but from here on

i want more crazy mourning more howl more keening

from a woman dead in her forties

and all at once the heavy night

fell from my eyes and i could see

a drenched and dripping appletree

a sky grown clear and blue again

and as i looked a quickening gust

of wind blew up to me and thrust

into my face a miracle

of orchardbreath and with the smell

i know not how such things can be

i breathed my soul back into me

ah up then from the ground sprang i

and hailed the earth with such a cry

as is not heard save from a man

who has been dead and lives again

about the trees my arms i wound

like one gone mad i hugged the ground

i raised my quivering arms on high

i laughed and laughed into the sky

always in my love sudden night

always in myself my enemy

and always in my always the same absence

when you choose to be a poet

you become a place that people walk through

and then leave when they are ready

sadness is the ambrosia of all art

the poet doesnt invent he listens

are powerful

they are destruction

they are nourishment

they are flesh

they are water

they are flowers

and bone

they burn they cleanse

they erase they etch

they can either

leave you

or brimming

with home

loves mysteries in souls do grow

but yet the body is his book

phlox lilacmisted under a quarter moon

the sweet smells of heliotrope and nightscented stock the garden is very still

it is dazed with moonlight

contented with perfume

the inmost spirit of poetry in other words is at bottom in every recorded case the voice of pain – and the physical body so to speak of poetry is the treatment by which the poet tries to reconcile that pain with the world

with all honesty somewhere between the hello and the dreams i saw you in i fell in love

i am solitary as grass what is it i miss

shall i ever find it whatever it is

you will never catch up

know you could tumble at any second

then decide what to do with your time

the art of disappearing

one must read poetry with ones nerves

she wasnt broken she was just bent over the chance of being ignored by the one she loved

but i dont shut up and i dont die

and fight maddening

those who rule my country

for if i live

and if i fight

i contribute to the dawn

love is like the wild rosebriar

friendship like the hollytree

the holly is dark when the rosebriar blooms

but which will bloom most constantly

the wild rosebriar is sweet in spring

its summer blossoms scent the air

yet wait till winter comes again

and who will call the wildbriar fair

then scorn the silly rosewreath now

and deck thee with hollys sheen

that when december blights thy brow

he still may leave thy garland green

i went to the garden of love

and saw what i never had seen

a chapel was built in the midst

where i used to play on the green

and the gates of this chapel were shut

and thou shalt not writ over the door

so i turnd to the garden of love

that so many sweet flowers bore

and i saw it was filled with graves

and tombstones where flowers should be

and priests in black gowns were walking their rounds

and binding with briars my joys  desires

the garden of love

i had been hungry all the years

my noon had come to dine

i trembling drew the table near

and touched the curious wine

twas this on tables i had seen

when turning hungry lone

i looked in windows for the wealth

i could not hope to own

i did not know the ample bread

twas so unlike the crumb

the birds and i had often shared

in natures diningroom

the plenty hurt me twas so new

myself felt ill and odd

as berry of a mountain bush

transplanted to the road

nor was i hungry so i found

that hunger was a way

the entering takes away

one merit of poetry few persons will deny it says more and in fewer words than prose

this is the city and i am one of the citizenswhatever interests the rest interests me

loving someone who hates

themselves

is a special kind of violence

a fight inside the bones

a war within the blood

you have to imagine

a waiting that is not impatient

because it is timeless

poems can get

sleepless too

and become

the loneliest thing

in the universe

but for their cries

the herons would be lost

amidst the morning snow

in the north on an upland bare

it standeth whitely shrouded

with snow and sleepeth there

it dreameth of a palm tree

which far in the east alone

in the mournful silence standeth

on its ridge of burning stone

we dont read and write poetry because its cute we read and write poetry because we are members of the human race

were lost where the mind cant find us

on i’ll pass

dragging my huge love behind me

on what

by what goliaths was i begot –

i so big

and by no one needed

tears upon the dry sponge of heart

do not prove i am promethean

girls are cruelest to themselves

who remained a girl all her life despite her body as a woman

had cruelty drifted up in all the cracks of her like spring snow

the one that burned the hottest is the first to die

i have learned and dismantled all the words in order to draw from them a

i am inhabited by a cry

nightly it flaps out

looking with its hooks for something to love

from elm written  april

what makes us leave what we love best

what is it inside us that keeps erasing itself

when we need it most

that sends us into uncertainty for its own sake

and holds us flush there

until we begin to love it

and have to begin again

what is it within our own lives we decline to live

whenever we find it

making our days unendurable

and nights almost visionless

i still dont know yet but i do it

under the wide and starry sky

dig the grave and let me lie

glad did i live and gladly die

and i laid me down with a will

this be the verse you grave for me

here he lies where he longd to be

home is the sailor home from the sea

and the hunter home from the hill

to wake the soul by tender strokes of art

to raise the genius and to mend the heart

i am a carnival of

there is no poetry where there are no mistakes

she dealt her pretty words like blades

how glittering they shone

and every one unbared a nerve

or wantoned with a bone

she never deemed  she hurt

that  is not steels affair

a vulgar grimace in the flesh

how ill the creatures bear

to ache is human  not polite

the film upon the eye

mortalitys old custom

just locking up  to die

soul receives from soul that knowledge therefore not by book nor from tongue if knowledge of mysteries come after emptiness of mind that is illumination of heart

kill what you cant save

what you cant eat throw out

what you cant throw out bury

what you cant bury give away

what you cant give away you must carry with you

it is always heavier than you thought

and i ask myself and you which of our visions will claim us

which will we claim

how will we go on living

how will we touch what will we know

what will we say to each other

no duties i don’t have to be profound

i don’t have to be artistically perfect

or sublime or edifying

i just wander i say ‘you were running

that’s fine it was the thing to do’

and now the music of the worlds transforms me

my planet enters a different house

trees and lawns become more distinct

philosophies one after another go out

everything is lighter yet not less odd

we talk a little of district fairs

of travels in a covered wagon with a cloud of dust behind

of how rivers once were what the scent of calamus is

that’s better than examining one’s private dreams

and meanwhile it has arrived it’s here invisible

who can guess how it got here everywhere

let others take care of it time for me to play hooky

it was a dance of masks and every mask was perfect because every mask was a real face and every face was a

real mask so there was no mask and there was no face for there was but one dance in which there was but

one mask but one true face which was the same and which was a thing without a name which changed and

changed into itself over and over

we talk so abstractly about poetry because all of us are usually bad poets

poetry is a deal of joy and pain and wonder with a dash of the dictionary

i dont want to hate the president

i dont want to go to harvard

i dont want to win the pulitzer prize

i just want to sit in my bathtub

and think about relationships i will never have

with people i will never meet

and then go lay in my bed

with a magnifying glass

and count all the stiches in my sheets

until i fall asleep

and wake up

to repeat again

at first when the rain fell

from the sky so wide and deep

it smelled like sage my favorite smell

i went up on the plateau to watch it come

to see the gifts it always brought

but this rain changed from blue to black

and left

the bustle in a house

the morning after death

the sweeping up the heart

and putting love away

we shall not want to use again

until eternity

will you walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly

the ambitions are wake up breathe keep breathing

a feather is trimmed it is trimmed by the light and the bug and the post it is trimmed by little leaning and by all sorts of mounted reserves and loud volumes it is surely cohesive

well now

if little by little you stop loving me

i shall stop loving you little by little

if suddenly

you forget me

do not look for me

for i shall already have forgotten you

i heard a thousand blended notes

while in a grove i sate reclined

in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts

bring sad thoughts to the mind

to her fair works did nature link

the human soul that through me ran

and much it grieved my heart to think

what man has made of man

through primrose tufts in that green bower

the periwinkle trailed its wreaths

and tis my faith that every flower

enjoys the air it breathes

the birds around me hopped and played

their thoughts i cannot measure

but the least motion which they made

it seemed a thrill of pleasure

the budding twigs spread out their fan

to catch the breezy air

and i must think do all i can

that there was pleasure there

if this belief from heaven be sent

if such be natures holy plan

have i not reason to lament

what man has made of man

i have been to lots of parties

and acted perfectly disgraceful

but i never actually collapsed

oh lana turner we love you get up

you just go on your nerve

all the black leather

she needs

is the ez boy recliner

where her love is parked

with one of his hands wrapped around a remote

the other a bottle of beer

shes right its kinky

the way he doesnt look away

from the tv

as her head bobs

like a fishermans float

with the pace

his breath sets

his crotch swells

under her mouths

prowess hes such

he waits

until the

to come

between two worlds life hovers like a star

twixt night and morn upon the horizons verge

how little do we know that which we are

how less what we may be the eternal surge

of time and tide rolls on and bears afar

our bubbles as the old burst new emerge

lashd from the foam of ages while the graves

of empires heave but like some passing waves

they grew they did not talk about growing

i want a quiet life

other times

i want to go

and there i make it work

wont you celebrate with me

what i have shaped into

a kind of life i had no model

both nonwhite and woman

what did i see to be except myself

i made it up

here on this bridge between

starshine and clay

my one hand holding tight

my other hand come celebrate

with me that everyday

something has tried to kill me

and has failed

why love what you will lose

there is nothing else to love

it was the kind of moon

that i would want to

send back to my ancestors

and gift to my descendants

so they know that i too

have been bruisedby beauty

you not only are hunted by others you unknowingly hunt yourself

i am too full of life

to be halfloved

sleeping in the forest

i thought the earth remembered me

she took me back so tenderly

full of lichens and seeds

i slept as never before a stone on the river bed

nothing between me and the white fire of the stars

but my thoughts and they floated light as moths

among the branches of the perfect trees

all night i heard the small kingdoms

breathing around me the insects

and the birds who do their work in the darkness

all night i rose and fell as if in water

grappling with a luminous doom by morning

i had vanished at least a dozen times

into something better

we humans

are so tortured

by not properly guessing

what will make us happy

there is no competition of sounds between a nightingale and a violin

quicksilver lizards in the adobe walls

the bird that punctures space

the pines taught me to talk to myself

in that garden i learnedto send myself off

later there were no gardens

poetry may make us from time to time a little more aware of the deeper unnamed feelings which form the substratum of our being to which we rarely penetrate for our lives are mostly a constant evasion of ourselves

the soul selects her own society—

then—shuts the door—

to her divine majority—

present no more—

unmoved—she notes the chariots—pausing—

unmoved—an emperor be kneeling

ive known her—from an ample nation—

then—close the valves of her attention—

knockkneed coughing like hags we cursed through sludge

till on the haunting flares we turned our backs

and towards our distant rest began to trudge

but limped on bloodshod all went lame all blind

drunk with fatigue deaf even to the hoots

of disappointed shells that dropped behind

gas gas quick boys an ecstasy of fumbling

fitting the clumsy helmets just in time

but someone still was yelling out and stumbling

and floundering like a man in fire or lime

dim through the misty panes and thick green light

as under a green sea i saw him drowning

in all my dreams before my helpless sight

he plunges at me guttering choking drowning

if in some smothering dreams you too could pace

behind the wagon that we flung him in

and watch the white eyes writhing in his face

his hanging face like a devils sick of sin

if you could hear at every jolt the blood

come gargling from the frothcorrupted lungs

obscene as cancer bitter as the cud

my friend you would not tell with such high zest

to children ardent for some desperate glory

you are her mother

why did you not warn her

hold her like a rotting boat

and tell her that men will not love her

if she is covered in continents

if her teeth are small colonies

if her stomach is an island

if her thighs are borders

what man wants to lie down

and watch the world burn

in his bedroom

your daughter ’s face is a small riot

her hands are a civil war

a refugee camp behind each ear

a body littered with ugly things

but god

doesn’t she wear

the world well

i play with the fire of my own truth she told me i will burn for the things i love

be my lover between two wars waged in the mirror she said

i dont want to return now to the fortress of my fathers house

take me to your vineyard

let me meet your mother

perfume me with basil water

arrange me on silver dishes comb me

imprison me in your name

love me in actions not in words

the jewel

there is this cave

in the air behind my body

that nobody is going to touch

when i stand upright in the wind

my bones turn to dark emeralds

i stepped from plank to plank

so slow and cautiously

the stars about my head i felt

about my feet the sea

i knew not but the next

would be my final inch —

this gave me that precarious gait

some call experience

where you find truth

is where you find your reflection

and where you find your reflection

is where you find love

and where you find love

is where you find light

and where you find light

is where you find faith

and where you find faith

is where you find purpose

and where you find purpose

is where you find happiness

and where you find happiness

is where you find truth

and when you find truth

truth will set you free

a crust of bread and a corner to sleep in

a minute to smile and an hour to weep in

a pint of joy to a peck of trouble

and never a laugh but the moans come double

and that is life

a crust and a corner that love makes precious

with a smile to warm and the tears to refresh us

and joy seems sweeter when cares come after

and a moan is the finest of foils for laughter

and that is life

fondling she saith since i have hemmd thee here

within the circuit of this ivory pale

ill be a park and thou shalt be my deer

feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale

graze on my lips and if those hills be dry

stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie

the listeners

is there anybody there said the traveller

knocking on the moonlit door

and his horse in the silence champed the grasses

of the forests ferny floor

and a bird flew up out of the turret

above the travellers head

and he smote upon the door again a second time

is there anybody there he said

but no one descended to the traveller

no head from the leaffringed sill

leaned over and looked into his grey eyes

where he stood perplexed and still

but only a host of phantom listeners

that dwelt in the lone house then

stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight

to that voice from the world of men

stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair

that goes down to the empty hall

hearkening in an air stirred and shaken

by the lonely travellers call

and he felt in his heart their strangeness

their stillness answering his cry

while his horse moved cropping the dark turf

neath the starred and leafy sky

for he suddenly smote on the door even

louder and lifted his head

tell them i came and no one answered

that i kept my word he said

never the least stir made the listeners

though every word he spake

fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house

from the one man left awake

ay they heard his foot upon the stirrup

and the sound of iron on stone

and how the silence surged softly backward

when the plunging hoofs were gone

from a little spark may burst a flame

we can make our lives sublime

and departing leave behind us

footprints on the sands of time

footprints that perhaps another

sailing oer lifes solemn main

a forlorn and shipwrecked brother

seeing shall take heart again

sometimes a piece of the sun burned like a coin between my hands

frida kahlo to marty mcconnell

leaving is not enough you must

stay gone train your heart

like a dog change the locks

even on the house he’s never

visited you lucky lucky girl

you have an apartment

just your size a bathtub

full of tea a heart the size

of arizona but not nearly

so arid don’t wish away

your cracked past your

crooked toes your problems

are papier mache puppets

you made or bought because the vendor

at the market was so compelling you just

had to have them you had to have him

and you did and now you pull down

the bridge between your houses

you make him call before

he visits you take a lover

for granted you take

a lover who looks at you

like maybe you are magic make

the first bottle you consume

in this place a relic place it

on whatever altar you fashion

with a knife and five cranberries

don’t lose too much weight

stupid girls are always trying

to disappear as revenge and you

are not stupid you loved a man

with more hands than a parade

of beggars and here you stand heart

heart leaking something so strong

they can smell it in the street

there are things that are not sayable thats why we have words

there is such a shelter in each other

because two bodies naked and entwined

leap over time they are invulnerable

nothing can touch them they return to the source

there is no you no i no tomorrow

no yesterday no names the truth of two

oh total being

so i will greet you

all loved things

are meant to be greeted

with a tear in my heart

and a poem in my eye

if you

dont want to

end up in

someone elses

then maybe

you should

an unapologetic poet

i saw thee once  only once  years ago

i must not say how many  but not many

it was a july midnight and from out

a fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring

sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven

there fell a silverysilken veil of light

with quietude and sultriness and slumber

upon the upturnd faces of a thousand

roses that grew in an enchanted garden

where no wind dared stir unless on tiptoe

fell on the upturnd faces of these roses

that gave out in return for the lovelight

their odorous souls in an ecstatic death

fell on the upturnd faces of these roses

that smiled and died in the parterre enchanted

by thee and by the poetry of thy presence

clad all in white upon a violet bank

i saw thee half reclining while the moon

fell upon the upturnd faces of the roses

and on thine own upturnd  alas in sorrow

was it not fate that on this july midnight

was it not fate whose name is also sorrow

that bade me pause before that gardengate

to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses

no footsteps stirred the hated world all slept

save only thee and me oh heaven  oh g

how my heart beats in coupling those two words

save only thee and me i paused  i looked

and in an instant all things disappeared

ah bear in mind the garden was enchanted

the pearly lustre of the moon went out

the mossy banks and the meandering paths

the happy flowers and the repining trees

were seen no more the very roses odors

died in the arms of the adoring airs

all  all expired save thee  save less than thou

save only divine light in thine eyes

save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes

i saw but them  they were the world to me

i saw but them  saw only them for hours

saw only them until the moon went down

what wild hearthistories seemed to lie enwritten

upon those crystalline celestial spheres

how dark a wo yet how sublime a hope

how silently serene a sea of pride

how daring an ambition yet how deep

how fathomless a capacity for love

but now at length dear dian sank from sight

into a western couch of thundercloud

and thou a ghost amid the entombing trees

didst glide away only thine eyes remained

they would not go  they never yet have gone

lighting my lonely pathway home that night

they have not left me as my hopes have since

they follow me  they lead me through the years

they are my ministers  yet i their slave

their office is to illumine and enkindle

my duty to be saved by their bright fire

and purified in their electric fire

and sanctified in their elysian fire

they fill my soul with beauty which is hope

and are far up in heaven  the stars i kneel to

in the sad silent watches of my night

while even in the meridian glare of day

i see them still  two sweetly scintillant

venuses unextinguished by the sun

we were strange in love

her and i

too wild to last

too rare to die

sometimes with one i love i fill myself with rage for fear i effuse unreturnd love

but now i think there is no unreturnd love—the pay is certain one way or another

i loved a certain person ardently and my love was not returnd

yet out of that i have written these songs

the characters in my novels are my own unrealised possibilities that is why i am equally fond of them all and equally horrified by them each one has crossed a border that i myself have circumvented

where do the words go

when we have said them

i sang in my chains like the sea

we all who live have

a life that is lived

and another life that is thought

and the only life we have

its the one that is divided

in right or wrong

the phantom of the manwhowouldunderstand

the lost brother the twin

for him did we leave our mothers

deny our sisters over and over

did we invent him conjure him

over the charring log

nights late in the snowbound cabin

did we dream or scry his face

in the liquid embers

the manwhowoulddaretoknowus

it was never the rapist

it was the brother lost

the comradetwin whose palm

would bear a lifeline like our own

it was never the crude pestle the blind

ramrod we were after

with natural resources equal to our own

she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly

sometimes the quiet ones are yelling on the inside

my atoms love you atoms it’s chemistry

love our subject

weve trained it like ivy to our walls

birds are flyin south for winter

heres the weirdbird headin north

he says its not that i like ice

or freezin winds and snowy ground

its just sometimes its kind of nice

to be the only bird in town

far away our dreams have nothing to do with what we do the wind carries the night and passes on aimless

i could not love thee dear so much

loved i not honour more

this is the hour of lead –

remembered if outlived

as freezing persons recollect the snow –

first – chill – then stupor – then the letting go –

the palate of the hate departs

if any would avenge

let him be quick  the viand flits

it is a faded meat

anger as soon as fed is dead

tis starving makes it fat

i think i should get love inked on my skin

maybe thats the only way i am destined to keep it

each month is gay

each season nice

when eating

with rice

how long your closet held a whiff of you

long after hangers hung austere and bare

i would walk in and suddenly the true

sharp sweet sweat scent controlled the air

and life was in that small still living breath

where are you since so much of you is here

your unique odour quite ignoring death

my hands reach out to touch to hold whats dear

and vital in my longing empty arms

but other clothes fill up the space your space

and scent on scent send out strange false alarms

not of your odour there is not a trace

but something unexpected still breaks through

the goneness to the presentness of you

to me fair friend you never can be old

for as you were when first your eye i eyd

such seems your beauty still

of the many forms that silence takes the most memorable is the dry husk of the cicada

winters ghost

incautious in the dark river

winter’s ghost walks

with a covered face

and silver bones wait in all animals

to be bone cloth upon her shoulder

wait for her happiness in that they are silver

my heart is strong

i will not fail

i wont be wronged

i will prevail

you wouldnt let me

love both of us

at the same time

is no paradise of arbors —

to us

that the stalled motor

of the heart

has started to work

again

the eyeit cannot choose but see

we cannot bid the ear be still

our bodies feel whereer they be

against or with our will

because some things

arent ours to hold

but just beautiful

to listen to

here we go mother on the shipless ocean

pity us pity the ocean here we go

it is difficult to write a paradiso when all the superficial indications are that you ought to write an apocalypse

when composing a verse let there not be a hairs breath separating your mind from what you write composition of a poem must be done in an instant like a woodcutter felling a huge tree or a swordsman leaping at a dangerous enemy

armed i am with love disarmed i am

if everything happens that cant be done

and anythings righter

than books

the stupidest teacher will almost guess

with a run

around we go yes

theres nothing as something as one

one hasnt a why or because or although

and buds know better

than books

dont grow

ones anything old being everything new

with a what

which

around we come who

so world is a leaf so tree is a bough

and birds sing sweeter

than books

tell how

so here is away and so your is a my

with a down

up

around again fly

forever was never till now

now i love you and you love me

and books are shutter

than books

can be

and deep in the high that does nothing but fall

with a shout

each

around we go all

theres somebody calling whos we

were anything brighter than even the sun

were everything greater

than books

were everanything more than believe

with a spin

alive were alive

were wonderful one times one

words rich in meaning can be cheap in sound effects

works of art are of an infinite solitude and no means of approach is so useless as criticism only love can touch and hold them and be fair to them

love is the poetry of the senses

it is not our job to remain whole

we came to lose our leaves

like the trees and be born again

drawing up from the great roots

mad ireland hurt you into poetry

before the gate

my walking sticks made a river

there will be stars

there will be stars over the place forever

though the house we loved and the street we loved are lost

every time the earth circles her orbit

on the night the autumn equinox is crossed

two stars we knew poised on the peak of midnight

will reach their zenith stillness will be deep

there will be stars over the place forever

there will be stars forever while we sleep

suddenly i remembered that laugh it told a different story our story

the quitter

when youre lost in the wild and youre scared as a child

and death looks you bang in the eye

and youre sore as a boil its according to hoyle

to cock your revolver and    die

but the code of a man says fight all you can

and selfdissolution is barred

in hunger and woe oh its easy to blow

its the hellservedforbreakfast thats hard

youre sick of the game well now thats a shame

youre young and youre brave and youre bright

youve had a raw deal i know — but dont squeal

buck up do your damnedest and fight

its the plugging away that will win you the day

so dont be a piker old pard

just draw on your grit its so easy to quit

its the keepingyourchinup thats hard

its easy to cry that youre beaten — and die

its easy to crawfish and crawl

but to fight and to fight when hopes out of sight —

why thats the best game of them all

and though you come out of each gruelling bout

all broken and beaten and scarred

just have one more try — its dead easy to die

its the keepingonliving thats hard

someday you will name me

then gently place those burning

holy roses in my hair

sometimes he did not know if he slept or just thought about sleep

like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore

so do our minutes hasten to their end

each changing place with that which goes before

in sequent toil all forwards do contend

for we cannot tarry here

we must march my darlings we must bear the brunt of danger

we the youthful sinewy races all the rest on us depend pioneers o pioneers

i have no doubt at all the devil grins

as seas of ink i spatter

ye gods forgive my literary sins

the other kind dont matter

to be loved is all i need

and whom i love i love indeed

with heart at rest i climbed the citadels

steep height and saw the city as from a tower

hospital brothel prison and such hells

where evil comes up softly like a flower

thou knowest o satan patron of my pain

not for vain tears i went up at that hour

but like an old sad faithful lecher fain

to drink delight of that enormous trull

whose hellish beauty makes me young again

whether thou sleep with heavy vapors full

sodden with day or new appareled stand

i love thee infamous city harlots and

hunted have pleasures of their own to give

the vulgar herd can never understand

today i pass the time reading

saying the few words over and over

it feels like eating

the same small perfect grape

again and again

i walk through the house reciting it

and leave its letters falling

through the air of every room

i stand by the big silence of the piano and say it

i say it in front of a painting of the sea

i tap out its rhythm on an empty shelf

i listen to myself saying it

then i say it without listening

then i hear it without saying it

and when the dog looks up at me

i kneel down on the floor

and whisper it into each of his long white ears

it’s the one about the oneton

with the moth sleeping on its surface

and every time i say it i feel the excruciating

pressure of the moth

on the surface of the iron bell

when i say it at the window

the bell is the world

and i am the moth resting there

when i say it into the mirror

i am the heavy bell

and the moth is life with its papery wings

and later when i say it to you in the dark

you are the bell

and i am the tongue of the bell ringing you

and the moth has flown

from its line

and moves like a hinge in the air above our bed

through endless night the earth whirls toward a creation unknown

i dont want to

because boys

dont write poetry

girls do

hed been let down so often

his brow was on the floor

but then they found

a small hole in the ground

and let him down some more

he will one day meet his true love a fellow traveler on the road her eyes will be his ocean in her ocean he will sail forever

she was a phantom of delight

when first she gleamd upon my sight

to be a moments ornament

her eyes as stars of twilight fair

like twilights too her dusky hair

but all things else about her drawn

from maytime and the cheerful dawn

a dancing shape an image gay

to haunt to startle and waylay

not words

nor laughter

but rather someone

who will fall in love

with your silence

the exceeding brightness of this early sun

makes me conceive how dark i have become

there’s too much risk in loving’

the young boy said

‘no’

‘there’s too much risk in not

we must unlearn the constellations to see the stars

you deserve to be the person you were meant to be

one makes dry clothes wet the other makes wet clothes dry they seem to be thwarting each other but their work is a perfect harmony

every holy person seems to have a different doctrine and practice but theres really only one work

ive had it with these cheap sons of bitches who claim they love poetry but never buy a book

monet grew his gardens

before he painted them

as he took her hand

he gave her

all she had been

down her spine

everything in creation has its appointed painter or poet and remains in bondage like the princess in the fairy tale til its appropriate liberator comes to set it free

sometimes it feels like someone else is wearing my body

its better to swim in the sea below

than to swing in the air and feed the crow

desire loneliness wind in the flowering almond—

surely these are the great the inexhaustible subjects

to which my predecessors apprenticed themselves

i hear them echo in my own heart disguised as convention

kieranhis head propped on a stack of poetry books he’d brought from the library almost all of them had been inscribed on the inside cover by a james herondale who had neatly written out his favorite lines

do you remember

the man you married

remind me who i am

she dwelt among the untrodden ways

she dwelt among the untrodden ways

beside the springs of dove

a maid whom there were none to praise

and very few to love

a violet by a mossy stone

half hidden from the eye

—fair as a star when only one

is shining in the sky

she lived unknown and few could know

when lucy ceased to be

but she is in her grave and oh

the difference to me

advice to young poets

to be a unicorn

by sticking a plunger on your head

hearing a crow with no mouth

cry in the deep

darkness of the night

i feel a longing for

my father before he was born

stairways who practice

alchemy inside bottle caps who know

the altruism of a last syringe

we somehow must become what we are not sacrificing what we are to inherit the masquerade of what we will be

out from shadows

then jumps away this

is what ive come to find

tooled by insular wind it

slams and slams

to and without meaning

i do think the bars

that kept my spirit in are burst  that i

am sailing with thee through the dizzy sky

how beautiful thou art

our foundation is rocky

because we made a home

in each other’s skin

the damage is beginning

to show

contemporary poetry is a kind of reykjavik a place where accessibility and intelligence have been fighting a cold war by proxy for the last halfcentury

i will try to disappoint you

better than anyone else has

love is a chemical reaction

but it cannot be fully understood or defined by science

and though a body cannot exist without a soul

it too cannot be fully understood or defined by science

love is the most powerful form of energy

but science cannot decipher its elements

yet the best cure for a sick soul is love

but even the most advanced physician

cannot prescribe it as medicine

incomplete science by suzy kassem

the heiress of the destroyed day

this is joys bonfire then where loves strong arts

make of so noble individual parts

one fire of four inflaming eyes and of two loving hearts

there came one and knocked at the door of the beloved

and a voice answered and said who is there

the lover replied it is i

go hence returned the voice

there is no room within for thee and me

then came the lover a second time and knocked and again the voice demanded

who is there

he answered it is thou

enter said the voice for i am within

at the age of four you were an artist and at seven you were a poet

the night sky is only a sort of carbon paper

blueblack with the muchpoked periods of stars

letting in the light peephole after peephole

a bonewhite light like death behind all things

love is a shadow

how you lie and cry after it

i heard of a man

who says words so beautifully

that if he only speaks their name

women give themselves to him

if i am dumb beside your body

while silence blossoms like tumors on our lips

it is because i hear a man climb stairs

and clear his throat outside our door

for i dipped into the future far as human eye could see

saw the vision of the world and all the wonder that would be

i held a jewel in my fingers

and went to sleep

the day was warm and winds were prosy

i said t will keep

i woke and chid my honest fingers—

the gem was gone

and now an amethyst remembrance

is all i own

any healthy man can go without food for two daysbut not without poetry

what is this life if full of care

we have no time to stand and stare

of all the super heroes

the strangest one by far

doesnt have a special power

or drive a fancy car

next to superman and batman i guess he must seem tame

but to me he is quite special

and stain boy is his name

he cant fly around tall buildings

or outrun a speeding train

the only talent he seems to have

is to leave a nasty stain

sometimes i know it bothers him

that he cant run or swim or fly

and because of this one ability

his dry cleaning bill is skyhigh

maybe what this is what we have is something that will save us from ourselves

may be its mine badluck

or yours not to get me

but i still have hope

of being yours

when i can feel you breathing into me i like a stone gargoyle

atop some crumbling building

spring to life

a song is the exultation of the mind dwelling on eternal things bursting forth in the voice

you can tell its a poem because its swimming in a little gel pack of white space that shows its a poem

but at my back i always hear

time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near

i wouldn’t want to be faster

or greener than now if you were with me o you

were the best of all my days

and now we step to the rhythm of miracles

from the light that never dies

i had forgotten disgust shadows desire

if our two loves be one or thou and i

love so alike that none do slacken none can die

and each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his freedom

ye are better than all the ballads

that ever were sung or said

for ye are living poems

and all the rest are dead

there are no lungs like the ones that breathe poetry

and then i feel the sun itself

as it blazes over the hills

clearly im not needed

yet i feel myself turning

into something of inexplicable value

from the buddhas last instruction

the press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections

they scorn the best i can do to relate them

air goes in and out

of my nose throat lungs blood heart

brain  and so i am

i love to move like a mouse inside this puzzle for the body balancing the wish to be lost with the need to be found

the fountains mingle with the river

and the rivers with the ocean

the winds of heaven mix forever

with a sweet emotion

nothing in the world is single

all things by a law divine

in one anothers being mingle—

why not i with thine

see the mountains kiss high heaven

and the waves clasp one another

no sister flower would be forgiven

if it disdained its brother

and the sunlight clasps the earth

and the moonbeams kiss the sea—

what are all these kissings worth

if thou kiss not me

whatever you do

be gentle with yourself

you don’t just live

in this world

or your home

or your skin

you also live

in someone’s eyes

oh i have slipped the surly bonds of earth

and danced the skies on laughtersilvered wings

sunward i’ve climbed and joined the tumbling mirth

of sunsplit clouds — and done a hundred things

you have not dreamed of — wheeled and soared and swung

high in the sunlit silence hov’ring there

i’ve chased the shouting wind along and flung

my eager craft through footless halls of air

up up the long delirious burning blue

i’ve topped the windswept heights with easy grace

where never lark or even eagle flew —

and while with silent lifting mind ive trod

the high untrespassed sanctity of space

put out my hand and touched the face of god

think of what starlight

and lamplight would lack

diamonds and fireflies

if they couldn’t lean against black

look deeper through the telescope

and do not be afraid when the stars

collide towards the darkness

because sometimes the most beautiful

everything you invent is true you can be sure of that poetry is a subject as precise as geometry

some winters

will never melt

some summers

will never freeze

and some things will only

secretly deep down everybody on earth believes they can write poetry apart from the members of the poets guild who know they cant

you are that one breath that puts all the remaining breaths back into my body

dear to me is sleep still more being made of stone

while pain and guilt still linger here below

blindness and numbnessthese please me alone

then do not wake me keep your voices low

but words are things and a small drop of ink

that which makes thousands perhaps millions think

’t is strange the shortest letter which man uses

of ages to what straits old time reduces

frail man when paper — even a rag like this

survives himself his tomb and all that’s his

sand lines my soul which is filled with the breath of the ocean

loneliness can fly a helicopter through a cutout shape

of a helicopter the same size as the helicopter

and thats its only skill

and it isnt good enough

but its still amazing

the poem must resist the intelligence

what were you before you met me

i think i was drowning

and what are you now

poetry is an abstraction bloodied

balm of the summer night balm of the ordinary

imperial joy and sorrow of human existence

the dreamed as well as the lived—

what could be dearer than this given the closeness of death

at blackwater pond the tossed waters have settled

after a night of rain

i dip my cupped hands i drink

a long time it tastes

like stone leaves fire it falls cold

into my body waking the bones i hear them

oh what is that beautiful thing

that just happened

there’s gold and it’s haunting and haunting

it’s luring me on as of old

yet it isn’t the gold that i’m wanting

so much as just finding the gold

it’s the great big broad land ’way up yonder

it’s the forests where silence has lease

it’s the beauty that thrills me with wonder

it’s the stillness that fills me with peace

silver hidden in the gold

young man hidden in the old

laughing lord with weeping eyes

bring king and ring before sunrise

hilarion the great and terrible quest

how weightless

words are when nothing will do

which is an irony

cos fascists are a minority

a poem should be palpable and mute

as a globed fruit

as old medallions to the thumb

silent as the sleeveworn stone

of casement ledges where the moss has grown—

a poem should be wordless

as the flight of birds

a poem should be motionless in time

as the moon climbs

leaving as the moon releases

twig by twig the nightentangled trees

leaving as the moon behind the winter leaves

memory by memory the mind—

a poem should be motionless in time

as the moon climbs

a poem should be equal to

not true

for all the history of grief

an empty doorway and a maple leaf

the leaning grasses and two lights above the sea—

a poem should not mean

but be

i am—yet what i am none cares or knows

my friends forsake me like a memory lost

i am the selfconsumer of my woes—

they rise and vanish in oblivious host

like shadows in love’s frenzied stifled throes

and yet i am and live—like vapours tossed

into the nothingness of scorn and noise

into the living sea of waking dreams

where there is neither sense of life or joys

but the vast shipwreck of my life’s esteems

even the dearest that i loved the best

are strange—nay rather stranger than the rest

sometimes a child will go under

while their parent is watching

and they don’t even know

my mom asks if everything’s okay

and i say of course

drowning is a quiet

i have been here before

but when or how i cannot tell

i know the grass beyond the door

the sweet keen smell

the sighing sound the lights around the shore

i write write and write but i cant find words that define what i feel inside

history says don’t hope

on this side of the grave

but then once in a lifetime

the longedfor tidal wave

of justice can rise up

and hope and history rhyme

i am the absence

this is

always the case

wherever i am

i am what is missing

life is the only way

to get covered in leaves

catch your breath on the sand

to be a dog

or stroke its warm fur

to tell pain

from everything its not

to squeeze inside events

to seek the least of all possible mistakes

an extraordinary chance

to remember for a moment

with the lamp switched off

and if only once

to stumble upon a stone

end up soaked in one downpour or another

mislay your keys in the grass

and to follow a spark on the wind with your eyes

and to keep on not knowing

here’s a toast to alan turing

who thought outside the container

and loved outside the lines

and so the codebreaker was broken

and we’re sorry

yes now the sword has been spoken

the official conscience woken

– very carefully scripted but at least it’s not encrypted –

and the story does suggest

a part  to the turing test

can machines behave like humans

can we

women are not roses

women have no

only continual

women are not

women are not

they are not oceans

or stars

i would like to tell

her this but

i think she

don’t lead cows to slaughter

i love you and i know

i should’ve told you soona

but you didn’t buy the dolphinsafe tuna

true wit is nature to advantage dressd

what oft was thought but neer so well expressd

something whose truth convinced at sight we find

that gives us back the image of our mind

as shades more sweetly recommend the light

so modest plainness sets off sprightly wit

till human voices wake us and we drown

and tools

one impulse from a vernal wood

may teach you more of man

of moral evil and of good

than all the sages can

all the rest is silence

on the other side of the wall

and the silence ripeness

and the ripeness all

reclaiming the sacred in our lives naturally brings us close once more to the wellsprings of poetry

hate blows a bubble of despair into

hugeness world system universe and bang

fear buries a tomorrow under woe

and up comes yesterday most green and young

rise the mountains of instead

from whose cold cascading streams

i dont love her anymore

so

why should i walk

by the tavern

where i drank

thinking of her

be aware of the high notes of the blissful faces and their soft messages and listen for the silent message of a highly decorated gift

i sit in my tree

i sing like the birds

my beak is my pen

my songs are my poems

the moon is no door it is a face in its own right

white as a knuckle and terribly upset

it drags the sea after it like a dark crime it is quiet

with the ogape of complete despair i live here

i do think that poetry is important though if you don’t strive at it if you don’t fill it full of stars and falseness

from whichever side i start i think i am in an old place where others have been before me

poetry is more necessary than ever as a fire to light our tongues

i offer you what i have my

thou best of thieves who with an easy key

dost open life and unperceived by us

even steal us from ourselves

arrival in the world is really a departure and that which we call departure is only a return

i hate the day because it lendeth light

to see all things but not my love to see

teaching others he corrected himself

i saw the spiders marching through the air

swimming from tree to tree that mildewed day

in latter august when the hay

came creaking to the barn but where

the wind is westerly

where gnarled november makes the spiders fly

into the apparitions of the sky

they purpose nothing but their ease and die

urgently beating east to sunrise and the sea

i cant think of a case where poems changed the world but what they do is they change peoples understanding of whats going on in the world

dont worry—

you see

to some you are magic

for me

you are fresh water

that falls from trees

when it has stopped raining for me

you are cinnamon that lingers

on the tongue and gives

for me you are the scent of

violins and vision

and still

for me your loveliness never ends

it traverses

the world

and finds its

way back to me

only

my boy

he is even

better than

fiction has nothing on you

let him easter in us be a dayspring to the dimness of us be a crimsoncresseted east

from quiet homes and first beginning

out to the undiscovered ends

theres nothing worth the wear of winning

but laughter and the love of friends

and thus we all are nighing

the truth we fear to know

death will end our crying

for friends that come and go

i am of old and young of the foolish as much as the wise

maternal as well as paternal a child as well as a man

stuffed with the stuff that is course and stuffed with the stuff that is fine one of the nation of many nations the smallest the same and the the largest

sweet as the tender fragrance that survives

when martyred flowers breathe out their little lives

sweet as a song that once consoled our pain

but never will be sung to us again

is they remembrance now the hour of rest

hath come to thee sleep darling it is best

and tell only truths

i enjoy melancholic music and art they take me to places i dont normally get to go

people with yuan fen are destined to like one another

friendship develops even if a thousand miles apart

but should yuan fen be absent between two individuals

they will remain strangers despite sitting facetoface

i have no words — alas — to tell

the loveliness of loving well

i have known the inexorable sadness of pencils

neat in their boxes dolor of pad and paper weight

all the misery of manilla folders and mucilage

the unalterable pathos of basin and pitcher

endless duplicaton of lives and objects

and i have seen dust from the walls of institutions

finer than flour alive more dangerous than silica

sift almost invisible through long afternoons of tedium

dropping a fine film on nails and delicate eyebrows

glazing the pale hair the duplicate gray standard faces

when she left me

i stood out in the thunderstorm

hoping to be destroyed by lightning

it missed first left then right

this this indeed is to be accursed

for if we mortals love or if we sing

we count our joys not by what we have

but by what kept us from that perfect thing

how can i that girl standing there

my attention fix

on roman or on russian

or on spanish politics

yet heres a travelled man that knows

what he talks about

and theres a politician

that has read and thought

and maybe what they say is true

of war and wars alarms

but o that i were young again

and held her in my arms

our planet is poorly equipped for delight

one must snatch gladness from the days that are

in this life

its not difficult to die

to make life

is more difficult by far

the bud

stands for all things

even for those things that don’t flower

for everything flowers from within of selfblessing

though sometimes it is necessary

to reteach a thing its loveliness

to put a hand on its brow

of the flower

and retell it in words and in touch

it is lovely

until it flowers again from within of selfblessing

no one here likes a wet dog

that loss is common would not make

my own less bitter rather more

too common never morning wore

to evening but some heart did break

and i realise the only way to tell the others

is through the way my voice can take these broken words

and turn it into music

turn it into poetry

and i sing to make myself come alive

but also for you

because i’d like this to mean something

to not disappear with the dark i will enter one day

and so now i will tell

if not for you then for my own heart

because it tells me to

and im learning to listen

interior of the hand sole that has come to walk

only on feelings that faces upward

and in its mirror

receives heavenly roads which travel

along themselves

that has learned to walk upon water

when it scoops

that walks upon wells

that steps into other hands

changes those that are like it

into a landscape

wanders and arrives within them

fills them with arrival

i wondered what happens when a hundred thousand people memorize the same poem does anything change

time has transfigured them into

untruth the stone fidelity

they hardly meant has come to be

their final blazon and to prove

our almostinstinct almost true

what will survive of us is love

the statement ‘there is nothing more american than an indian’ happens to be a multidimensional paradox try and not say too many of those that might open your mind to ideas that could cause sanity point loss

i felt a cleaving in my mind—

as if my brain had split—

i tried to match it—seam by seam—

but could not make it fit

the thought behind i strove to join

unto the thought before—

but sequence ravelled out of sound

as you set out for ithaka

hope the voyage is a long one

laistrygonians and cyclops

angry poseidon—don’t be afraid of them

you’ll never find things like that on your way

as long as you keep your thoughts raised high

as long as a rare excitement

stirs your spirit and your body

laistrygonians and cyclops

wild poseidon—you won’t encounter them

unless you bring them along inside your soul

unless your soul sets them up in front of you

hope the voyage is a long one

may there be many a summer morning when

with what pleasure what joy

you come into harbors seen for the first time

may you stop at phoenician trading stations

to buy fine things

mother of pearl and coral amber and ebony

as many sensual perfumes as you can

and may you visit many egyptian cities

to gather stores of knowledge from their scholars

keep ithaka always in your mind

arriving there is what you are destined for

but do not hurry the journey at all

better if it lasts for years

so you are old by the time you reach the island

wealthy with all you have gained on the way

not expecting ithaka to make you rich

ithaka gave you the marvelous journey

without her you would not have set out

she has nothing left to give you now

and if you find her poor ithaka won’t have fooled you

wise as you will have become so full of experience

you will have understood by then what these ithakas mean

still what i want in my life

is to be willing

to be dazzled—

to cast aside the weight of facts

and maybe even

to float a little

above this difficult world

i want to believe i am looking

into the white fire of a great mystery

i want to believe that the imperfections are nothing—

that the light is everything—that it is more than the sum

of each flawed blossom rising and falling and i do

yes i read i have that absurd habit i like beautiful poems moving poetry and all the beyond of that poetry i am extraordinarily sensitive to those poor marvelous words left in our dark night by a few men i never knew

prose words in their best order poetry the best words in the best order

when i have fears that i may cease to be

when i have fears that i may cease to be

before my pen has glean’d my teeming brain

before high piled books in charact’ry

hold like rich garners the fullripen’d grain

when i behold upon the night’s starr’d face

and think that i may never live to trace

their shadows with the magic hand of chance

and when i feel fair creature of an hour

that i shall never look upon thee more

never have relish in the faery power

of unreflecting love—then on the shore

of the wide world i stand alone and think

till love and fame to nothingness do sink

the night is darkening round me

the night is darkening round me

the wild winds coldly blow

but a tyrant spell has bound me

and i cannot cannot go

the giant trees are bending

their bare boughs weighed with snow

the storm is fast descending

and yet i cannot go

clouds beyond clouds above me

wastes beyond wastes below

but nothing drear can move me

i will not cannot go

lets get loose

with

lets drown in the delicious

sweet is the lore which nature brings

our meddling intellect

misshapes the beauteous forms of things—

we murder to dissect

open the fridge and put

my heart on a plate

im just as you left

me and i taste even better

love is the only bow on life’s dark cloud it is the morning and the evening star it shines upon the babe and sheds its radiance on the quiet tomb it is the mother of art inspirer of poet patriot and philosopher

it is the air and light of every heart – builder of every home kindler of every fire on every hearth it was the first to dream of immortality it fills the world with melody – for music is the voice of love

theres in my mind a

or old woman or both

dressed in opals and rags feathers

and torn taffeta

who knows strange songs

but she is not kind

world is suddener than we fancy it

i couldnt tell fact from fiction

or if the dream was true

my only sure prediction

in this world was you

id touch your features inchly beard love and dared the cost the sented spiel reeled me unreal and i found my senses lost

when hitler marched

across the rhine

to take the land of france

‘let’s make the tyrant dance’

let him take the land and city

the hills and every flower

one thing he will never have

the elegant eiffel tower

the french cut the cables

the elevators stood still

‘if he wants to reach the top

let him walk it if he will’

the invaders hung a swastika

the largest ever seen

but a fresh breeze blew

and away it flew

never more to be seen

they hung up a second mark

smaller than the first

but a patriot climbed

with a thought in mind

‘never your duty shirk’

up the iron lady

he stealthily made his way

hanging the bright tricolour

he heroically saved the day

then for some strange reason

a mystery to this day

hitler never climbed the tower

on the ground he had to stay

at last he ordered she be razed

down to a twisted pile

a futile attack for still she stands

sully suffers from a stutter

simple syllables will clutter

stalling speeches up on beaches

sully strains to say his phrases

sickened by the sounds he raises

strings of thoughts come out in knots

he solves his sentences like mazes

at night he writes his thoughts instead

and sighs as they steadily rush from his head

i kept loving and loving and loving every waking hour i marveled on how these moments would make made me feel i wanted to love the world and be the change it so deliciously craved

now therefore while the youthful hue

and while thy willing soul transpires

at every pore with instant fires

now let us sport us while we may

and now like amorous birds of prey

rather at once our time devour

than languish in his slowchapped power

let us roll all our strength and all

our sweetness up into one ball

and tear our pleasures with rough strife

thorough the iron gates of life

thus though we cannot make our sun

stand still yet we will make him run

for our generation walks as in hades without the divine

if galileo had said in verse that the world moved the inquisition might have let him alone

don’t write with a pen ink tends to give the impression the words shouldn’t be changed

write with what gives you the most sensual satisfaction

don’t erase cross out rapidly and violently never with slow consideration if you can help it

start as some smarty once said in the middle of things

play with syntax

never want to say anything so strongly that you have to give up the option of finding something better – if you have to say it you will

read your poem aloud many times if you don’t enjoy it every time something may be wrong

if you ask a question don’t answer it or answer a question not asked or defer if you can answer the question to ask it is to waste time

don’t be afraid to take emotional possession of words if you don’t love a few words enough to own them you will have to be very clever to write a good poem

oh i know its cliché but yeah they say that great men make it in

to places few others who even do take the riskve ever been

i love women whose hidden desires make horses put an end to their lives at the threshold

a woman will tell you

every home she has ever inhabited

has been broken into

starting with her body

now a promise made is a debt unpaid

and the trail has its own stern code

i notice you have the assault proof vest

so its my fault i guess

so apparently i didnt say no as loud as my clothes could say yes

you see i didnt know that my ‘no’ wasnt enough

i didnt understand that my body became less precious

because certain dresses

and i guess if im wearing the wrong top

then my ‘yes’ is the same as ‘stop’

and you shouldnt have to just because i begged you to

im begging you

tell me the magic outfit and ill buy it

apparently my ‘no’ wasnt heard

even when i screamed

so i need my clothes to be quiet

that night we made love the real way which we had not yet attempted

big mystery no one knew where to put their leg and to this day im not sure

we got it right

he seemed happy youre like venice he said beautifully

i wrote a short talk on defloration which he stole and had published

overall this was a characteristic interaction between us

or should i say ideal

all the new thinking is about loss in this it resembles all the old thinking

only one thing remained reachable close and secure amid all losses language yes language in spite of everything it remained secure against loss

poetry should be great and unobtrusive a thing which enters into ones soul and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject

the house was quiet and the world was calm

the house was quiet and the world was calm

the reader became the book and summer night

was like the conscious being of the book

the house was quiet and the world was calm

the words were spoken as if there was no book

except that the reader leaned above the page

wanted to lean wanted much to be

the scholar to whom his book is true to whom

the summer night is like a perfection of thought

the house was quiet because it had to be

the quiet was part of the meaning part of the mind

the access of perfection to the page

and the world was calm the truth in a calm world

in which there is no other meaning itself

is calm itself is summer and night itself

is the reader leaning late and reading there

dont sign your name

between worlds

the manifold of meanings

trust the tearstain

learn to live

lord aint it a shame

sharing the blame

but when she was dying

lord we let her down

theres no use cryin

it cant help her now

the partys all over

drink up and go home

its too late to love her

and leave her alone

just say she was someone

lord so far from home

whose life was so lonesome

she died all alone

who dreamed pretty dreams

that never came true

lord why was she born

so black and blue

oh why was she born

so black and blue

epitaph black and blue

written by kris kristofferson

note epitaph is about janis joplin

rolling world teeming with millions

carousel of the hungry

is there food enough wheat and corn will not do

the fat are the hungriest of all the skinny the most silent

unless you call attention

to your presence

who will know youre there

has to weave and wave a flag

as proof of its existence

art too is just a way of living

when the green woods laugh with the voice of joy and the dimpling stream runs laughing by when the air does laugh with our merry wit and the green hill laughs with the noise of it

whats madness but nobility of soul

at odds with circumstance the days on fire

i know the purity of pure despair

my shadow pinned against a sweating wall

that place among the rocksis it a cave

or winding path the edge is what i have

darkdark my light and darker my desire

my soul like some heatmaddened summer fly

keeps buzzing at the sill

from the waking by theodore roethke

a poem is never a putup job so to speak it begins as a lump in the throat a sense of wrong a homesickness a lovesickness it is never a thought to begin with

it was like this when

we waltz into this place

is doing an aztec twostep

and i says

dad lets cut

but then this dame

comes up behind me see

and says

you and me could really exist

only the next day

she has bad teeth

and really hates

im going to do something bigger and better

bigger and better

and bolder but first

im going to do something

smaller and worse

id spent way more years worrying about how to look like a poet  buying black clothes smearing on scarlet lipstick languidly draping myself over thriftstore furniture  than i had learning how to assemble words in some discernible order

we are not concerned with the very poor they are unthinkable and only to be approached by the statistician or the poet

truth is a friend

that asks for loyalty

and acceptance

then it enters our hearts

dissolving the boundaries

freeing us from lonliness

and if i

if i ever let love go

because the hatred and the whisperings

become a phantom dictate i o

bey in lieu of impulse and realities

the blossoming flamingos of my

then let love freeze me

out

from i must become a menace to my enemies

cheapen words and theyll cheapen you

my personality

unfolding before you

ive written some poetry i dont understand myself

but let us laugh carelessly like other men

let us be timid even among fools

let us knot silence around our throats

for they would surely kill us

poetry seems especially like nothing else so much as itself poetry is not like it is the very lining of the inner life

words are what sticks to the real we use them to push the real to drag the real into the poem they are what we hold on with nothing else they are as valuable in themselves as rope with nothing to be tied to

someones sent

and as the moon fills

my western chamber

as petals dance

over the flowing stream

again i think of you

the two of us

a hurt that cant be removed

yet when my gaze comes down

my heart stays up

or catch them like fishes in nets

and sometimes the things that life misses

help more than the things that it gets

the poem is a little myth of mans capacity of making life meaningful

you are only as free as you think you are and freedom will always be as real as you believe it to be

whatever you get out of poetry  take it take it take it

words are better off felt than understood

histories make men wise poets witty the mathematics subtle natural philosophy deep moral grave logic and rhetoric able to contend

from what we cannot hold the stars are made

say to them

say to the downkeepers

the sunslappers

the selfsoilers

the harmonyhushers

even if you are not ready for day

it cannot always be night

you will be right

for that is the hard homerun

live not for battles won

live not for theendofthesong

live in the along

we thought everything would be

forgotten but i still remember your

claws running down my back

i wonder if you still think about us

the way i do

how our legs would crash

into each other in the middle

of the night and how we ended

up creating the moon in the

confines of our beds

excuse me i feel interrupted and i think ive overdose from the idea of loving you

pleasure is a freedomsong

but it is not freedom

it is the blossoming of your desires

but it is not their fruit

it is a depth calling unto a height

but it is not the deep nor the high

it is the caged taking wing

but it is not space encompassed

aye in very truth pleasure is a freedomsong

and i fain would have you sing it with fullness of heart yet i would

not have you lose your hearts in the singing

some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all and they are judged

and rebuked

i would not judge nor rebuke them i would have them seek

for they shall find pleasure but not her alone

seven are her sisters and the least of them is more beautiful than

have you not heard of the man who was digging in the earth for roots

and found a treasure

and some of your elders remember pleasures with regret like wrongs

but regret is the beclouding of the mind and not its chastisement

they should remember their pleasures with gratitude as they would

the harvest of a summer

yet if it comforts them to regret let them be comforted

and there are among you those who are neither young to seek nor old

to remember

and in their fear of seeking and remembering they shun all pleasures

lest they neglect the spirit or offend against it

but even in their foregoing is their pleasure

and thus they too find a treasure though they dig for roots with quivering

but tell me who is he that can offend the spirit

shall the nightingale offend the stillness of the night or the firefly the

and shall your flame or your smoke burden the wind

think you the spirit is a still pool which you can trouble with a staff

oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure you do but store the desire in

the recesses of your being

who knows but that which seems omitted today waits for tomorrow

even your body knows its heritage and its rightful need and will not

be deceived

and your body is the harp of your soul

and it is yours to bring forth sweet music from it or confused sounds

and now you ask in your heart how shall we distinguish that which

is good in pleasure from that which is not good

go to your fields and your gardens and you shall learn that it is the

pleasure of the bee to gather honey of the flower

but it is also the pleasure of the flower to yield its honey to the bee

for to the bee a flower is a fountain of life

and to the flower a bee is a messenger of love

and to both bee and flower the giving and the receiving of pleasure

is a need and an ecstasy

ah well aday what evil looks

had i from old and young

instead of the cross the albatross

about my neck was hung

know that we have met before and that we will meet again i will find my way to you in the next life and every life after that

i am filled time and again

with a heartaching wonder

when i think

of the fire

and frost of memories

of the everlastingness

the solace

and the power

how surely gravitys law

strong as an ocean current

takes hold of the smallest thing

and pulls it toward the heart of the world

each thing

each stone blossom child

only we in our arrogance

push out beyond what we each belong to

for some empty freedom

if we surrendered

to earths intelligence

we could rise up rooted like trees

instead we entangle ourselves

in knots of our own making

and struggle lonely and confused

so like children we begin again

to learn from the things

because they are in gods heart

they have never left him

this is what the things can teach us

to fall

patiently to trust our heaviness

even a bird has to do that

before he can fly

i spit into the face of time

that has transfigured me

and let me ask you this the dead

where arent they

i searched for you

and in endless seas

and metaphors

but we never were

on the same page

i can feel she has got out of bed

that means it is seven am

i have been lying with eyes shut

thinking or possibly dreaming

of how she might look if at breakfast

i spoke about the hidden place in her

which to me is like a soprano’s tremolo

and right then over toast and bramble jelly

if such things are possible she came

i imagine she would show it while trying to conceal it

i imagine her hair would fall about her face

and she would become apparently downcast

as she does at a concert when she is moved

the hypnopompic play passes and i open my eyes

and there she is next to the bed

bending to a low drawer picking over

and pink items of underwear she bends

so low her back runs parallel to the earth

but there is no sway in it there is little burden the day has hardly begun

the two mounds of muscles for walking leaping lovemaking

lift toward the east—what can i say

simile is useless there is nothing like them on earth

her breasts fall full the nipples

are deep pink in the glare shining up through the iron bars

of the gate under the earth where those who could not love

press wanting to be born again

i reach out and take her wrist

and she falls back into bed and at once starts unbuttoning my pajamas

later when i open my eyes there she is again

rummaging in the same low drawer

the clock shows eight hmmm

with huge silent effort of great

mounded muscles the earth has been turning

she takes a piece of silken cloth

from the drawer and stands up under the falls

of hair her face has become quiet and downcast

as if she will be all day among strangers

looking down inside herself at our rapture

her mind is a mess and she has no intention of cleaning today

love is wind for the soul

you too she asked ruth how do your poems start out

they start as a lump in the throat she said

the horses suddenly began to neigh protesting

against those who were drowning them in the ocean

the horses sank to the bottom neighing neighing

until they had all gone down

that is all nevertheless i pity them

those bay horses that never saw land again

the sun loved me again when it saw that the stars would not abandon me

thus weary of the world away she hies

and yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid

their mistress mounted through the empty skies

in her light chariot quickly is conveyd

holding their course to paphos where their queen

means to immure herself and not be seen

poem the spirit likes to dress up

the spirit

likes to dress up like this

shoulders and all the rest

in the black branches

in the morning

in the blue branches

of the world

it could float of course

but would rather

airy and shapeless thing

it needs

the metaphor of the body

lime and appetite

the oceanic fluids

it needs the body’s world

and imagination

and the dark hug of time

and tangibility

to be understood

to be more than pure light

that burns

where no one is –

so it enters us –

in the morning

shines from brute comfort

and at night

lights up the deep and wondrous

drownings of the body

dancing is like poetry written by our bodies our outstretched arms our words of longing

my tongue remembers your wounded flavor

the vein in my neck

adores you a sword

stands up between my hips

my hidden fleece sends forth its scent of human oil

when it is bad…

i go into the night

and the night eats me

i am not i pity the tale of me

let us go then you and i

when the evening is spread out against the sky

let us go through certain halfdeserted streets

the muttering retreats

and sawdust restaurants with oyster shells

streets that follow like a tedious argument

to lead you to an overwhelming question

oh do not ask what is it

let us go and make our visit

we have lingered in the chambers of the sea

by seagirls wreathed with seaweed red and brown

till human voices wake us and we drown

let me keep my distance always from those

who think they have the answers

let me keep company always with those who say

look and laugh in astonishment

and bow their heads

a wealth you cannot imagine

flows through you

do not consider what strangers say

be secluded in your secret hearthouse

that bowl of silence

tonight i can write

tonight i can write the saddest lines

write for example the night is starry and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance

the night wind revolves in the sky and sings

tonight i can write the saddest lines

i loved her and sometimes she loved me too

through nights like this one i held her in my arms

i kissed her again and again under the endless sky

she loved me sometimes i loved her too

how could one not have loved her great still eyes

tonight i can write the saddest lines

to think that i do not have her to feel that i have lost her

to hear the immense night still more immense without her

and the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture

what does it matter that my love could not keep her

the night is starry and she is not with me

this is all in the distance someone is singing in the distance

my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her

my sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer

my heart looks for her and she is not with me

the same night whitening the same trees

we of that time are no longer the same

i no longer love her thats certain but how i loved her

my voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing

anothers she will be anothers as she was before my kisses

i no longer love her thats certain but maybe i love her

love is so short forgetting is so long

because through nights like this one i held her in my arms

my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her

though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer

and these the last verses that i write for her

in the great green room there was a telephone

and a red balloon

and a picture of a cat jumping over the moon

how can i keep my soul in me so that

it doesn’t touch your soul how can i raise

it high enough past you to other things

i would like to shelter it among remote

lost objects in some dark and silent place

that doesn’t resonate when your depths resound

yet everything that touches us me and you

takes us together like a violin’s bow

which draws one voice out of two separate strings

upon what instrument are we two spanned

and what musician holds us in his hand

heavenly bodies are nests of invisible birds

the song of wandering aengus

i went out to the hazel wood

because a fire was in my head

and cut and peeled a hazel wand

and hooked a berry to a thread

and when white moths were on the wing

and mothlike stars were flickering out

i dropped the berry in a stream

and caught a little silver trout

when i had laid it on the floor

i went to blow the fire aflame

but something rustled on the floor

and someone called me by my name

it had become a glimmering girl

with apple blossom in her hair

who called me by my name and ran

and faded through the brightening air

though i am old with wandering

through hollow lands and hilly lands

i will find out where she has gone

and kiss her lips and take her hands

and walk among long dappled grass

and pluck till time and times are done

the silver apples of the moon

the golden apples of the sun

though you are in your shining days

voices among the crowd

and new friends busy with your praise

be not unkind or proud

but think about old friends the most

times bitter flood will rise

your beauty perish and be lost

for all eyes but these eyes

these wrinkles are nothing

these gray hairs are nothing

this stomach which sags

with old food these bruised

and swollen ankles

my darkening brain

they are nothing

i am the same boy

my mother used to kiss

unlike the scientist the artist has reentry problems that are frequent and catastrophic

the wit of cheats the courage of a whore

are what ten thousand envy and adore

all all look up with reverential awe

at crimes that scape or triumph oer the law

while truth worth wisdom daily they decry

nothing is sacred now but villainy

epilogue to the satires dialogue i

for now poetry has the capacity  in its own ways and by its own means  to remind us of something we are forbidden to see

to come to nothing through something is the way to outside from both sides

tread lightly she is near

under the snow

speak gently she can hear

the daisies grow

all her bright golden hair

tarnished with rust

she that was young and fair

fallen to dust

lilylike white as snow

she hardly knew

she was a woman so

sweetly she grew

lie on her breast

i vex my heart alone

she is at rest

peace peace she cannot hear

lyre or sonnet

all my life’s buried here

heap earth upon it

i cant just suddenly tell you

what i should be telling you

friend forgive me you know

that although you dont hear my words

i wasnt asleep or in tears

that i am with you without seeing you

for a good long time and until the end

with you a part of me hath passed away

for in the peopled forest of my mind

a tree made leafless by this wintry wind

shall never don again its green array

chapel and fireside country road and bay

have something of their friendliness resigned

another if i would i could not find

and i am grown much older in a day

but yet i treasure in my memory

your gift of charity and young hearts ease

and the dear honour of your amity

for these once mine my life is rich with these

and i scarce know which part may greater be

what i keep of you or you rob from me

modern poetry for me began not in english at all but in spanish in the poems of lorca

well in case you failed to notice

in case you failed to see

this is my heart bleeding before you

this is me down on my knees

these foolish games are tearing me apart

your thoughtless words are breaking my heart

youre breaking my heart

but now you are twain you are cloven apart

flesh of his flesh but heart of my heart

in all my life in all your wide creation

if i cannot repair it

i beg you to repair it

and then there are all the wounded

the poor the deaf the lonely and the old

whom i have roughly dismissed

as if i were not one of them

where i have wronged them by it

and cannot make amends

i ask you

to comfort them to overflowing

and where there are lives i may have withered around me

or lives of strangers far or near

that ive destroyed in blind complicity

and if i cannot find them

or have no way to serve them

remember them i beg you to remember them

when winter is over

and all your unimaginable promises

burst into song on deaths bare branches

there is no hope for the hopeless but there is always some love for the loveless

the flames are silent

tears are frozen

a smiling lie is a whirlwind easy to enter but hard to escape

in scientific thinking are always present elements of poetry science and music requires a thought homogeneous

we walked through night until there was a poem

o how we call each other names

you call me schizophrenic

i call you god

but we do agree on one

deluded are we both

honest criticism and sensible appreciation are directed not upon the poet but upon the poetry

on waterloo bridge where we said our goodbyes

the weather conditions bring tears to my eyes

i wipe them away with a black woolly glove

and try not to notice ive fallen in love

on waterloo bridge i am trying to think

this is nothing youre high on the charm and the drink

but the jukebox inside me is playing a song

that says something different and when was it wrong

on waterloo bridge with the wind in my hair

i am tempted to skip youre a fool i dont care

the head does its best but the heart is the boss

i admit it before i am halfway across

in pale moonlight  the wisterias scent  comes from far away

one writes because one has been touched by the yearning for and the despair of ever touching the other

two girls discover the secret of life

men had always been the reciters of poetry in the desert

maybe youre one of those people who writes poems but rarely reads them let me put this as delicately as i can if you dont read your writing is going to suck

and it was fun

i made animals that men had never seen

so they would stop and scratch their heads

i made words that men had never heard

so they would stop and stare at me

and i made love that laughed

tomorrow perhaps i wont be god

and you will know it

because you wont see any threeheaded cats

or bushes with bells on

so that lonely men could laugh

i came in haste with cursing breath

and heart of hardest steel

but when i saw thee cold in death

i felt as man should feel

for when i look upon that face

that cold unheeding frigid brown

where neither rage nor fear has place

by heaven i cannot hate thee now

little world full of scars and gashes ripened with anothers pain

your flowers feed on carrionso do your birds

men feed on each other because you taught them life was cheap

flowing from your endless womb without pain or understanding

no midwife caresses your flesh or bathes clean your progeny

life spurts from you little world

and you regard it with disdain

only bruised men sense your cruelty

men whose life has lost its meaning

its just me throwing myself at you

romance as usual us times us

not lust but moxibustion

to the body as possible

you can learn more by going to the opera than you ever can by reading emerson like that there are two sexes

the poem that took the place of a mountain

there it was word for word

the poem that took the place of a mountain

he breathed its oxygen

even when the book lay turned in the dust of his table

it reminded him how he had needed

a place to go to in his own direction

how he had recomposed the pines

shifted the rocks and picked his way among clouds

for the outlook that would be right

where he would be complete in an unexplained completion

the exact rock where his inexactness

would discover at last the view toward which they had edged

where he could lie and gazing down at the sea

recognize his unique and solitary home

for all the ghosts and corpses that shall never know the breath of our children

so long

for the sacrifice and endurance of our mothers and the sustained breath of our fathers

we live

in the boundaryless forests

there’re dancers of nude

yet in the confines of pasture

there’s promise of food

on which is your side

ô but tarry and bide

ere you decide

in both do confide

in seeking as in finding

each detail minding

and finding

my muse sits forlorn

she wishes she had not been born

she sits in the cold

no word she says is ever told

if i could find one word

that would shudder the air

like that frightened sob

that wordless prayer

of my newlyborn

who drew one breath

and with unopened eyes

sank back into death

if i could break the worlds cold heart

with that cry

then this grief would lift

and i could die

come to the beach with me

and watch the pelicans die

hear their feeble screams

calling to an empty sky

where once they played

and scouted for food

not scavenging like the gulls

but plummeting unafraid

into friendly waters

come to the beach with me

and watch the pelicans die

listen to their feeble screams

calling to an empty sky

maybe christ will walk by

and save them in their final toil

or work a miracle from the shore

come to the beach with me

and watch the pelicans die

my god theyll never fly again

its worse than normandy somehow

for there we only murdered men

oh friend forget not when you fain would note

in me a beauty that was never mine

how first you knew me in a book i wrote

how first you loved me for a written line

i can’t help but notice that you keep writing love poetry to my wife well you see i married her which makes her my wife you know what you might want to try writing some poems about the sunset the sunset isn’t fucking married

from the union of power and money

from the union of power and secrecy

from the union of government and science

from the union of government and art

from the union of science and money

from the union of ambition and ignorance

from the union of genius and war

from the union of outer space and inner vacuity

the mad farmer walks quietly away

this is newness every little tawdry

obstacle glasswrapped and peculiar

glinting and clinking in a saints falsetto only you

dont know what to make of the sudden slippiness

the blind white awful inaccessible slant

theres no getting up it by the words you know

no getting up by elephant or wheel or shoe

we have only come to look you are too new

to want the world in a glass hat

father rip sums me up at twentythree

she has no head for politics

craves good jewelry trusts too readily

marries too early then

one by one she sends away her friends

and stands apart smug sapphire

her answer to everything a slender

zero a silent shrugand every day

still hears me say shell never be pretty

instead she reads novels instead her belt

matches her shoes she is master

of the condolence letter and knows

how to please a man with her mouth

good nose too large eyes too closely set

hair not glorious blonde not her mothers red

nor the glossy black her younger sister has

the little raven i loved best

literature will lose sunlight will win dont worry

no truer word save gods was ever spoken

than that the largest heart is soonest broken

when a womans face is wrinkled

and her hairs are sprinkled

with gray lackaday

aside shes cast

no one respect will pay

and while the sun shines make hay

you must not expect in december

the flowers you gathered in may

let be be finale of seem

the only emperor is the emperor of icecream

and the hippos were boiled in their tanks

lean in to kiss me

in all the places

where the ache

the most special

depth and substance

the two most exquisite qualities

be it in a poem

or a person

for it is up to you and me

in nostalgias arms

and our ability

to create

the everlasting

from fleeting moments

with soft pillows

with tender lips

and fingers

shall i compare thee to a barrel of apples

though art more hairy but sweeter inside

rough winds couldnt keep me from taking you to chapel

where finally a horse could take a bride

you and i

will be

lost and found

along this

be

and we’d

it

always too eager for the future we

pick up bad habits of expectancy

till then we say

watching from a bluff the tiny clear

how slow they are and how much time they waste

refusing to make haste

yet still they leave us holding wretched stalks

of disappointment for though nothing balks

each big approach leaning with brasswork prinked

each rope distinct

flagged and the figurehead with golden tits

arching our way it never anchors its

no sooner present than it turns to past

right to the last

we think each one will heave to and unload

all good into our lives all we are owed

for waiting so devoutly and so long

but we are wrong

only one ship is seeking us a black

a huge and birdless silence in her wake

no waters breed or break

no one leaves home unless

home is the mouth of a shark

you only run for the border

when you see the whole city running as well

your neighbors running faster than you

breath bloody in their throats

the boy you went to school with

who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory

is holding a gun bigger than his body

you only leave home

when home won’t let you stay

no one leaves home unless home chases you

hot blood in your belly

it’s not something you ever thought of doing

until the blade burnt threats into

your neck

and even then you carried the anthem under

your breath

only tearing up your passport in an airport toilets

sobbing as each mouthful of paper

made it clear that you wouldn’t be going back

you have to understand

that no one puts their children in a boat

unless the water is safer than the land

no one burns their palms

no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck

feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled

means something more than journey

no one crawls under fences

no one wants to be beaten

no one chooses refugee camps

or strip searches where your

or prison

because prison is safer

than a city of fire

and one prison guard

in the night

is better than a truckload

of men who look like your father

no one could take it

no one could stomach it

no one skin would be tough enough

the

sucking our country dry

niggers with their hands out

they smell strange

messed up their country and now they want

to mess ours up

how do the words

the dirty looks

roll off your backs

maybe because the blow is softer

than a limb torn off

or the words are more tender

than fourteen men between

your legs

or the insults are easier

to swallow

than rubble

than bone

than your child body

i want to go home

but home is the mouth of a shark

home is the barrel of the gun

and no one would leave home

unless home chased you to the shore

unless home told you

to quicken your legs

leave your clothes behind

crawl through the desert

wade through the oceans

be hunger

your survival is more important

no one leaves home until home is a sweaty voice in your ear

run away from me now

i dont know what i’ve become

but i know that anywhere

is safer than here

this dewdrop world

is but a dewdrop world

and yet —

and then she would smile to show me how and it was the saddest smile i ever saw

but drunkenly or secretly we swore

disciples of that astigmatic saint

that we would never leave the island

until we had put down in paint in words

as palmists learn the network of a hand

all of its sunken leafchoked ravines

muttering in brackish dialect the ropes of mangroves

from which old soldier crabs slipped

surrendering to slush

each ochre track seeking some hilltop and

losing itself in an unfinished phrase

under sand shipyards where the burntout palms

inverted the design of unrigged schooners

entering forests boiling with life

the sun drumming drumming

past the defeated pennons of the palms

roads limp from sunstroke

past green flutes of the grass

the ocean cannonading come

wonder that opened like the fan

of the dividing fronds

on some noonstruck sahara

where my heart from its rib cage yelped like a pup

after clouds of sanderlings rustily wheeling

the world on its ancient

the breakers slowdolphining over more breakers

to swivel our easels down as firm

as conquerors who had discovered home

my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun

coral is far more red than her lips red

if snow be white why then her breasts are dun

if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head

i have seen roses damaskd red and white

but no such roses see i in her cheeks

and in some perfumes is there more delight

than in the breath that from my mistress reeks

i love to hear her speak yet well i know

that music hath a far more pleasing sound

i grant i never saw a goddess go

my mistress when she walks treads on the ground

and yet by heaven i think my love as rare

as any she belied with false compare

had we but world enough and time

a poem should not mean

but be

can turn tides

and burst forth with rivers

from paradise

there is a charm in solitude that cheers

a feeling that the world knows nothing of

a green delight the wounded mind endears

after the hustling world is broken off

whose whole delight was crime at good to scoff

green solitude his prison pleasure yields

the bitch fox heeds him not  birds seem to laugh

he lives the crusoe of his lonely fields

which dark green oaks his noontide leisure shields

when shall i be dead and rid

of all the wrong my father did

how long how long till spade and hearse

put to sleep my mothers curse

but i

myself

on the throat

of my own song

life is so beautiful and so short

that anything that makes me feel

less than too much is nothing at all

my hearts scripture tastes

foreign in the mouths of

cowards and on the tongues of

those who have never breathed in

the moon and breathed out the world

im afraid of waking up

to a world where you see

and i am not what you saw

to lucasta going to the wars

tell me not sweet i am unkind

that from the nunnery

of thy chaste breast and quiet mind

to war and arms i fly

true a new mistress now i chase

the first foe in the field

and with a stronger faith embrace

yet this inconstancy is such

as thou too shalt adore

i could not love thee dear so much

loved i not honour more

when a group of people get up from a table the table doesn’t

know which way any of them will go

and here in thought to thee

in thought that can alone

ascend thy empire and so be

by winged fantasy

my embassy is given

till secrecy shall knowledge be

in the environs of heaven

if i could i would nail these hands to the edges of stars i would sacrifice this body to the sky hoping to resurrect as someone spiteful enough to not care about you

teach me to sing and recite

to whistle and jingle and strum

teach me to color and paint

to sculpt and weave and create

teach me to sway and dance

to tap and leap and twirl

teach me to laugh and giggle

to tickle and play and pretend

teach me that life is beautiful

there is something in the autumn that is native to my blood—

and my heart is like a rhyme

with the yellow and the purple and the crimson keeping time

to see myself to set the darkness echoing

science is the poetry of reality

i cant even make up a rhyme about an umbrella let alone death and life and eternal peace

broken hearts you can run you can hide and perhaps the earth is big enough to believe you’re safe so maybe for a moment you have escaped but hear me hear me well love will find you and it will leave nothing behind

gone to static

it sounds better than it is

this business of surviving

making it through

the wrong place

at the wrong time

and living

to tell

when the talk shows and movie credits

wear off its just me and my dumb

luck this morning

i had that dream again

the one where im dead

i wake up and nothings

much different everythings gone

by the bed youre

to the shower

scrub the luck of breath off my skin

but its futile

the killer always wins

its just a matter

and i have

time i have grief and liquor to

fill it tonight the liquor and i are

talking to you the liquor says remember

and i fill in the rest your hands your smile

all those times remember

tonight the liquor and i

are telling you about our day

we made it out of bed we miss you

we were surprised by the blood between

our legs we miss you we made it to the video

store missing you we stopped

at the liquor store

hoping the bourbon would stop

the missing theres always more

bourbon more missing

tonight when we got home

there was a stray cat

at the door

she came in

she screams to be touched

she screams

when i touch her

shes right

not me

the whisky is open

the vcr is on

im running

the film backwards

and one by one

you come back to me

all of you

your pulses stutter to a begin

your eyes go from fixed to blink

the knives come out of your chests the chainsaws

roar out

from your legs

your wounds seal over

your tcells multiply your tumors shrink

the maniac killer

its just you and me

and the bourbon and the movie

and the air breathes us and i

am home i am

i am right

before everything

four billion people on this earth

but my imagination is still the same

its bad with large numbers

its still taken by particularity

it flits in the dark like a flashlight

illuminating only random faces

while all the rest go by

never coming to mind and never really missed

the greatest adventure is to have no fear for the blaze that lies ahead

one breath taken completely one poem fully written fully read  in such a moment anything can happen

everything that looks too perfect is too perfect to be perfect

we’re only instruments of love flowing through heaps of pain hoping one day we’d hatch a passion of our own

what its size

will have varying

consequences it’s not

possible to predict

what will happen

if you

open the gunnysack

let the cat escape

or it might scratch

your eyes out you can’t

until you loosen the knot

do you chance losing

a friendship if that

friend’s wellbeing

will

only be preserved

by betraying swornto

silence trust once

the seam is ripped can

it be

mended again

and if that proves

impossible will you be

when it all falls to pieces

they come to us these restless dead

shrouds woven from the words of men

with trumpets sounding overhead

the walls of hope have grown so thin

and all our vaunted innocence

has withered in this endless frost

that promise little recompense

for all we risk for all weve lost

color is the overpowering of black white – the final victory over black

its so easy to be a poet

and so hard to be

one day i wrote her name upon the strand

one day i wrote her name upon the strand

but came the waves and washèd it away

again i wrote it with a second hand

but came the tide and made my pains his prey

vain man said she that dost in vain assay

a mortal thing so to immortalise

for i myself shall like to this decay

and eke my name be wipèd out likewise

not so quod i let baser things devise

to die in dust but you shall live by fame

my verse your virtues rare shall eternise

and in the heavens write your glorious name

where when as death shall all the world subdue

our love shall live and later life renew

the rising moon has hid the stars

lie on the landscape green

with shadows brown between

and silver white the river gleams

as if diana in her dreams

had dropt her silver bow

upon the meadows low

on such a tranquil night as this

she woke endymion with a kiss

when sleeping in the grove

he dreamed not of her love

like dians kiss unasked unsought

love gives itself but is not bought

nor voice nor sound betrays

its deep impassioned gaze

it comesthe beautiful the free

the crown of all humanity

in silence and alone

to seek the elected one

it lifts the boughs whose shadows deep

are lifes oblivion the souls sleep

and kisses the closed eyes

of him who slumbering lies

are fraught with fear and pain

ye shall be loved again

no one is so accursed by fate

no one so utterly desolate

but some heart though unknown

responds unto his own

respondsas if with unseen wings

an angel touched its quivering strings

and whispers in its song

where hast thou stayed so long

love will be

but most of all

life cannot be without it

it is found in the womb

in the woods

in the stars

to be or not to be

to love or not to love

they are equal

my soul whispers into the spaces

now goes under and i watch it go under the sun

that will not rise again

today has seen the setting in your eyes cold and senseless as the sea

of friendship better than bread and of bright charity

that lifts a man a little above the beasts that run

that this could be

that i should live to see

most vulgar pride that stale obstreperous clown

so fitted out with purple robe and crown

to stand among his betters face to face

with outraged me in this once holy place

where wisdom was a favoured guest and hunted

truth was harboured out of danger

he bulks enthroned a lewd an insupportable stranger

i would have sworn indeed i swore it

the hills may shift the waters may decline

winter may twist the stem from the twig that bore it

but never your love from me your hand from mine

now goes under the sun and i watch it go under

you too farewellbut fare not well enough to dream

you have done wisely to invite the night before the darkness came

the same word we love and hate leaves in different directions taking different paths

life is a poem most people never read

he had an answer to almost everything and he retired at an early age

he knows he will be born again

and start fresh anew

books tis a dull and endless strife

come hear the woodland linnet

how sweet his music on my life

theres more of wisdom in it

to have ruined ones self over poetry is an honor

i dont feel strong anymore

i feel like falling to my knees

things arent the way they were before

theyre not the way theyre supposed to be

did i live the spring i’d sought

it’s true in joy i walked along

and sang the song

and never tried to bind an hour

to my borrowed garden bower

nor did i once entreat

a day to slumber at my feet

yet days aren’t lulled by lyric song

like morning birds they pass along

o’er crests of trees to none belong

their larking flight my hands eschew

thus i’ll say it once and true…

from all that i saw

and everywhere i wandered

i learned that time cannot be spent

it only can be squandered

when theres a moon the shadows in the house grow larger

invisible hands draw back the curtains

of the piano

only in books the flat and final happens

only in dreams we meet and interlock

oh that was poetry said pippin do you really mean to start before the break of day

what a comfort to know that god is a poet

again i resume the long

lesson how small a thing

can be pleasing how little

in this hard world it takes

to satisfy the mind

and bring it to its rest

without thinking i knelt in the grass like someone meaning to pray

when i tried to stand again i couldnt move

my legs were utterly rigid does grief change you like that

through the birches i could see the pond

the sun was cutting small white holes in the water

i got up finally i walked down to the pond

i stood there brushing the grass from my skirt watching myself

like a girl after her first lover

turning slowly at the bathroom mirror naked looking for a sign

but nakedness in women is always a pose

i was not transfigured i would never be free

beauty’ is related not to ‘loveliness’ but to a state in which reality plays a part

be there a picnic for the devil

an orgy for the satyr

and a wedding for the bride

more or less love poems

no babe

wed never

swing together but

the syncopation

would be something wild

places we love

places we love exist only through us

space destroyed is only illusion in the constancy of time

places we love we can never leave

places we love together together together

and is this room really a room or an embrace

and what is beneath the window a street or years

and the window is only the imprint left by

the first rain we understood returning endlessly

and this wall does not define the room but perhaps the night

your son began to move in your sleeping blood

a son like a butterfly of flame in your hall of mirrors

the night you were frightened by your own light

and this door leads into any afternoon

which outlives it forever peopled

with your casual movements as you stepped

like fire into copper into my only memory

when you go space closes over like water behind you

do not look back there is nothing outside you

space is only time visible in a different way

places we love we can never leave

july th fireworks exhale over the hudson sadly

it is beautiful that they have to disappear

its like the time you said i love you madly

that was an hour ago its been a fervent year

my papas waltz

the whiskey on your breath

but i hung on like death

such waltzing was not easy

we romped until the pans

slid from the kitchen shelf

my mothers countenance

could not unfrown itself

the hand that held my wrist

was battered on one knuckle

at every step you missed

my right ear scraped a buckle

you beat time on my head

with a palm caked hard by dirt

then waltzed me off to bed

still clinging to your shirt

the poet knows that he speaks adequately then only when he speaks somewhat wildly

conceptions are artificial perceptions are essential

we dont read and write poetry because its cute

at five in the afternoon

it was exactly five in the afternoon

a boy brought the white sheet

at five in the afternoon

at five in the afternoon

the rest was death and death alone

stars in the night he said something something something something some delight

short talk on the sensation of airplane takeoff well you know i wonder it could be love running toward my life with its arms up yelling let’s buy it what a bargain

so much depends

splattered with mud

speeding down the road

the life we’re given is on a thread so wear it well

it was not in me it came and went

i wanted to hold it it was held by wine

i no longer know what it was

some see things as they are others as they are p cxci

crystal ball and candle light i want your dance tonight show me the power of love as we stand together in the middle of the night

strategy for a marathon

i will start

when the gun goes off

i will run

i will run

to the tenth mile

at the tenth

i will say

only three more

to the halfway

at the halfway mark

i will know

i will say

youve run twenty before

i will say

try to be thoughtful

dont make the poor man say it

see how human he is

he has children of his own

it is your job to ask

is she dead

and he will nod and say yes

and now he can never not nod

and now he can never say no

and now he can never not say

we may kill each other someday

more than daffodils

and cried more than june

i think here i will leave you it has come to seem

there is no perfect ending

indeed there are infinite endings

or perhaps once one begins

there are only endings

i just need you and some sunsets

freud thought that a psychosis was a waking dream and that poets were daydreamers too but i wonder if the reverse is not as often true and that madness is a fiction lived in like a rented house

always our wars have been our confessions of weakness

your politics are so far right

theyre wrong

after the leaves have fallen we return

to a plain sense of things it is as if

we had come to an end of the imagination

inanimate in an inert savoir

here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting here i shade and hide my thoughts i myself do not expose them and yet they expose me more than all my other poems

poetry isn’t an island it is the bridge

poetry isn’t a ship it is the lifeboat

poetry isn’t swimming poetry is water

a pear should come to the table popped with juice

ripened in warmth and served in warmth on terms

like these autumn beguiles the fatalist

with rue my heart is laden

with rue my heart is laden

for golden friends i had

for many a roselipt maiden

and many a lightfoot lad

by brooks too broad for leaping

the lightfoot boys are laid

the roselipt girls are sleeping

in fields where roses fade

almost none of the poetries i admire stick to their labels native or adopted ones rather they are vagrant in their identifications tramp poets there you go a new label for those with unstable allegiances

im tired of the language police turning a deaf ear banned as handicapism to my complaints im no pollyanna banned as sexist and will not accept any lame banned as offensive replace with walks with a cane excuses at this time

if you ever read my poems

and wish

they were written

for you

then others for breath of words respect

me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect

how far away the stars seem and how far

is our first kiss and ah how old my heart

one need never leave the confines of new york to get all the greenery one wishesi cant even enjoy a blade of grass unless i know theres a subway handy or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life

during my worst times

on the park benches

in the jails

or living with

i always had this certain

i wouldnt call it

it was more of an inner

that settled for

and it helped in the

and when relationships

with the

it helped

through the

wars and the

the backalley fights

the

to awaken in a cheap room

in a strange city and

pull up the shade

this was the craziest kind of

and to walk across the floor

to an old dresser with a

see myself ugly

grinning at it all

what matters most is

how well you

walk through the

a few yards away from my window sill

a brilliant blue jay is springing up and down up and down

i laugh as i see him abandon himself

to entire delight for he knows as well as i do

that the branch will not break

the assignment was to fall in love

the details were up to you

the second part was

to include in the poem certain words

words drawn from a specific text

i denied it

this new land but love i’ll concede this

whatever state you are i’ll be that state’s bird

the loud obvious blur of song people point to

when they wonder where it is you’ve gone

brahma and airavata

brahma turned to saraswati

and gently kissed her inked hand

when someone offers you lines like that he must be mephistopheles and you must be faust you know you shouldnt succumb to such language but you succumb

and then all that has divided us will merge

and then compassion will be wedded to power

and then softness will come to a world that is harsh and unkind

and then both men and women will be gentle

and then both women and men will be strong

and then no person will be subject to anothers will

and then all will be rich and free and varied

and then the greed of some will give way to the needs of many

and then all will share equally in the earths abundance

and then all will care for the sick and the weak and the old

and then all will nourish the young

and then all will cherish lifes creatures

and then all will live in harmony with each other and the earth

and then everywhere will be called eden once again

it must be a little love  a baby sort of

it shies away when the cars honk and hiss

but adores the bells on the horsetram

i dreamed that you bewitched me into bed

and sung me moonstruck kissed me quite insane

i think i made you up inside my head

from mad girls love song a villanelle written

the same hot lightning that burns your blood with passion–– cools your fears with peace

at the edge of madness you howl diamonds and pearls

when wounds are healed by love

the scars are beautiful

i don’t need your praise

to survive i was here first

before you were here before

you ever planted a garden

and i’ll be here when only the sun and moon

are left and the sea and the wide field

i will constitute the field

to helen

i saw thee onceonce onlyyears ago

i must not say how manybut not many

it was a july midnight and from out

a fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring

sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven

there fell a silverysilken veil of light

with quietude and sultriness and slumber

upon the upturnd faces of a thousand

roses that grew in an enchanted garden

where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe

fell on the upturnd faces of these roses

that gave out in return for the lovelight

thier odorous souls in an ecstatic death

fell on the upturnd faces of these roses

that smiled and died in this parterre enchanted by thee by the poetry of thy prescence

clad all in white upon a violet bank

i saw thee half reclining while the moon

fell on the upturnd faces of the roses

and on thine own upturndalas in sorrow

was it not fate that on this july midnight

was it not fate whose name is also sorrow

that bade me pause before that gardengate

to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses

no footstep stirred the hated world all slept

save only thee and me oh heaven oh god how my heart beats in coupling those two worlds

save only thee and me i paused i looked

and in an instant all things disappeared

ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted

the pearly lustre of the moon went out

the mossy banks and the meandering paths

the happy flowers and the repining trees

were seen no more the very roses odors

died in the arms of the adoring airs

all all expired save thee save less than thou

save only the divine light in thine eyes

save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes

i saw but them they were the world to me

i saw but them saw only them for hours

saw only them until the moon went down

what wild hearthistories seemed to lie enwritten

upon those crystalline celestial spheres

how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope

how silently serene a sea of pride

how daring an ambitionyet how deep

how fathomless a capacity for love

but now at length dear dian sank from sight

into western couch of thundercloud

and thou a ghost amid the entombing trees

didst glide away only thine eyes remained

they would not go they never yet have gone

lighting my lonely pathway home that night

they have not left me as my hopes have since

they follow me they lead me through the years

they are my ministers yet i thier slave

thier office is to illumine and enkindle

my duty to be saved by thier bright light

and purified in thier electric fire

and sanctified in thier elysian fire

they fill my soul with beauty which is hope

and are far up in heaven the stars i kneel to

in the sad silent watches of my night

while even in the meridian glare of day

i see them still two sweetly scintillant

venuses unextinguished by the sun

i am waiting for the war to be fought

which will make the world safe for anarchy

i will meet you on the nape of your neck one day on the surface of intention word becoming act

we will breathe into each other the high mountain tales where the snows come from where the waters begin

in the yellow time of pollen

love is a game

for the next x or o

to see the summer sky

is poetry though never in a book it lie—

what is this life if full of care

we have no time to stand and stare

no time to stand beneath the boughs

and stare as long as sheep or cows

so this is what i am

pondering his eyes that could not

conceive that i was a creature to run from

i who have always believed too much in words

to love is to soar in the wild unexpectedly

i sleep with thee and wake with thee

and yet thou are not there

i fill my arms with thoughts of thee

and press the common air

the townspeople took the prince for dead

when he never returned with the dragon’s head

when with her he stayed

she thought he’d be too afraid

but he loved her too much instead

surprised by joy impatient as the wind

i turned to share the transport oh with whom

but thee deep buried in the silent tomb

that spot which no vicissitude can find

love faithful love recalled thee to my mind

but how could i forget thee through what power

even for the least division of an hour

have i been so beguiled as to be blind

to my most grievous loss  that thoughts return

was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore

save one one only when i stood forlorn

knowing my hearts best treasure was no more

that neither present time nor years unborn

could to my sight that heavenly face restore

my love is like to ice and i to fire

my love is like to ice and i to fire

how comes it then that this her cold so great

is not dissolvd through my so hot desire

but harder grows the more i her entreat

or how comes it that my exceeding heat

is not delay’d by her heartfrozen cold

but that i burn much more in boiling sweat

and feel my flames augmented manifold

what more miraculous thing may be told

that fire which all things melts should harden ice

and ice which is congeal’d with senseless cold

should kindle fire by wonderful device

such is the power of love in gentle mind

that it can alter all the course of kind

we don’t know anything about silent sages buried knowledge the eye of the mute poet serene seers yet how many talkative destroyers prophets and ideologues teachers and beautifiers there are on the other side

not in the clamor of the crowded street

not in the shouts and plaudits of the throng

but in ourselves are triumph and defeat

dreams they start in your beautiful mind think of beautiful things and it will manifest into actions because your body will listen to you like it always does

language has not the power to speak what love indites

the soul lies buried in the ink that writes

a place where woman never smiled or wept

there to abide with my creator god

and sleep as i in childhood sweetly slept

untroubling and untroubled where i lie

the grass below—above the vaulted sky

i took her to bed with silk and song

lay still my love i won’t be long

i must prepare my body for passion

o your body you give but all else you ration

writing poetry is talking to oneself yet it is a mode of talking to oneself in which the self disappears and the products something that though it may not be for everybody is about everybody

at breakfast said louise in an awed voice a man who can read poetry at breakfast would be capable of anything

the scholars

bald heads forgetful of their sins

edit and annotate the lines

that young men tossing on their beds

rhymed out in love’s despair

to flatter beauty’s ignorant ear

they’ll cough in the ink to the world’s end

wear out the carpet with their shoes

earning respect have no strange friend

if they have sinned nobody knows

lord what would they say

should their catullus walk that way

take each day in your open palms and close your fists around it this life is not done with you yet

to jump over centuries

jump too high or far

you’ll be way too late

the apache dont have a word for love he said

know what they both say at the marriage the squawtaking ceremony

varlebena it means forever thats all they say

how you die out in me

down to the last

wornout

youre there with a

the way through the world

is more difficult to find than the way beyond it

with my ninth mind i resurrect my first

and dance slow to the music of my soul made new

all a poet can do today is warn

immortal amarant a flower which once

in paradise fast by the tree of life

began to bloom but soon for mans offence

to heaven removed where first it grew there grows

and flowers aloft shading the fount of life

and where the river of bliss through midst of heaven

with these that never fade the spirits elect

bind their resplendent locks

only poetry isnt shit

poems are difficult to silence

say this city has ten million souls

some are living in mansions some are living in holes

yet there’s no place for us my dear yet there’s no place for us

there is risk and truth to yourselves and the world before you

has it ever occurred to you he said that the whole history of english poetry has been determined by the fact that the english language lacks rhymes

this is the world we wanted

all who would have seen us dead

are dead i hear the witchs cry

break in the moonlight through a sheet

her tongue shrivels into gas

now far from womens arms

and memory of women in our fathers hut

we sleep are never hungry

why do i not forget

my father bars the door bars harm

from this house and it is years

no one remembers even you my brother

summer afternoons you look at me as though

you meant to leave

as though it never happened

but i killed for you i see armed firs

the spires of that gleaming kiln

nights i turn to you to hold me

but you are not there

am i alone spies

hiss in the stillness hansel

we are there still and it is real real

that black forest and the fire in earnest

outside the youth center between the liquor store

and the police station

a little dogwood tree is losing its mind

overflowing with blossomfoam

like a bride ripping off her clothes

dropping snow white petals to the ground in clouds

so nature’s wastefulness seems quietly obscene

it’s been doing that all week

and throwing it away

and making more

turning and turning in the widening gyre

the falcon cannot hear the falconer

things fall apart the centre cannot hold

mere anarchy is loosed upon the world

what did you think that joy  was some slight thing

dont wait for the man standing in the

to cut off his arm help him now

inscrutable and grand

i will let i dare not

and bear the twangling

of your small guitar

because you are my owl

and foster me with milk

why wet my paw

just keep me in a bag

and no one knows the truth

i am familiar with witches

and stand a better chance in hell than you

for i can dance on hot bricks

leap your height

and land on all fours

i am the servant of the living god

i worship in my way

look into these slit green stones

and follow your reflected lights

into the dark

you dont play with me

i play with you

be generous with your smile and try not to frown

and you will see my children your smile will never let you down ☺

imaginary gardens with real toads in them

if you demand on one hand

the raw material of poetry in

all its rawness and

that which is on the other hand

genuine then you are interested in poetry

the author to her book

thou illformed offspring of my feeble brain

who after birth didst by my side remain

till snatcht from thence by friends less wise than true

who thee abroad exposed to public view

made thee in rags halting to th press to trudge

where errors were not lessened all may judge

at thy return my blushing was not small

my rambling brat in print should mother call

i cast thee by as one unfit for light

the visage was so irksome in my sight

yet being mine own at length affection would

thy blemishes amend if so i could

i washed thy face but more defects i saw

and rubbing off a spot still made a flaw

i stretcht thy joints to make thee even feet

yet still thou runst more hobbling than is meet

in better dress to trim thee was my mind

but nought save homespun cloth i th house i find

in this array mongst vulgars mayst thou roam

in critics hands beware thou dost not come

and take thy way where yet thou art not known

if for thy father askt say thou hadst none

and for thy mother she alas is poor

which caused her thus to send thee out of door

most people ignore most poetry because poetry ignores most people

from my chair i can see the street and it seems depressing

catch from the board of beauty such careless crumbs as fall

that mortal is a fool who prospering thinks his life has any strong foundation since our fortunes course of action is the reeling way a madman takes and no one person is ever happy all the time

theres no retirement for an artistits your way of living so theres no end to it

if food is poetry is not poetry also food

love does not claim materialistic possession of any kind it yields complete freedom

its not what you go through that makes you strong it is how you handle the situation that gives you strength

from the mind which thinks to die let my soul sleep tonight

the ogre does what ogres can

but one prize is beyond his reach

the ogre cannot master speech

about a subjugated plain

among its desperate and slain

the ogre stalks with hands on hips

while drivel gushes from his lips

into the nothingness of scorn and noise

into the living sea of waking dreams

where there is neither sense of life or joys

but the vast shipwreck of my life’s esteems

even the dearest that i loved the best

are strange—nay rather stranger than the rest

all right

but all his friends have to pay

confront your greatest fears

voice your biggest problems

acknowledge your tiniest issues

the longer you stay silent

the louder they become

they wont disappear if you ignore them

they will spread and affect all aspects of your life

adventure runs on all sorts of whiskey

the pekes and the pollicles everyone knows

are proud and implacable passionate foes

it is always the same wherever one goes

and the pugs and the poms although most people say

that they do not like fighting will often display

every symptom of wanting to join in the fray

and they

until you can hear them all over the park

but to go to school in a summer morn

o it drives all joy away

under a cruel eye outworn

the little ones spend the day

in sighing and dismay

she wore his love like a loaded gun

the moon

and like a dying lady lean and pale

who totters forth wrappd in a gauzy veil

out of her chamber led by the insane

and feeble wanderings of her fading brain

the moon arose up in the murky east

a white and shapeless mass

of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth

among the stars that have a different birth

and ever changing like a joyless eye

that finds no object worth its constancy

the fact that i

am writing to you

already falsifies what i

wanted to tell you

my subject

how to explain to you

that i dont belong to english

if not here

the music is a vibration in the brain rather than the ear

the pure playfulness of certain wholly whimsical portions of charles cros’s work should not obscure the fact that at the center of some of his most beautiful poems a revolver is leveled straight at us

the only time shes come close to being known was when she accidentally came out as bisexual during sophomore english class while talking about her favorite poem

is bliss then such abyss

i must not put my foot amiss

for fear i spoil my shoe

id rather suit my foot

than save my boot

for yet to buy another pair

at any store

but bliss is sold just once

the patent lost

none buy it any more

every good poem asks a question and every good poet asks every question

souls grow on bones but die beneath bankers hours

i was the first chicano to write in complete sentences

we never know we go—when we are going

we jest and shut the door

fate following behind us bolts it

and we accost no more

presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn

indicative that suns go down

the notice to the startled grass

that darkness is about to pass

i think theres a kind of desperate hope built into poetry now that one really wants hopelessly to save the world one is trying to say everything that can be said for the things that one loves while theres still time

open wide the minds cagedoor

shell dart forth and cloudward soar

i heard a thousand blended notes

while in a grove i sate reclined

in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts

bring sad thoughts to the mind

to her fair works did nature link

the human soul that through me ran

and much it grieved my heart to think

what man has made of man

defenceless under the night

our world in stupor lies

flash out wherever the just

exchange their messages

may i composed like them

of eros and of dust

beleaguered by the same

negation and despair

show an affirming flame

we cannot consummate our bliss and not consume

all joys are cakes and vanish in eating

all bliss is sugars melting in the mouth

not with a club the heart is broken

nor with a stone –

a whip so small you could not see it

ive known

in a more golden light

each little doubt and fear

each little discord here

the awakening

i dreamed that i was a rose

that grew beside a lonely way

close by a path none ever chose

and there i lingered day by day

beneath the sunshine and the show’r

i grew and waited there apart

gathering perfume hour by hour

and storing it within my heart

just why i waited there and grew

i dreamed that you were a bee

that one day gaily flew along

you came across the hedge to me

and sang a soft loveburdened song

you brushed my petals with a kiss

i woke to gladness with a start

and yielded up to you in bliss

the treasured fragrance of my heart

and then i knew

that i had waited there for you

do not turn me

into

if you cannot promise

to be my stream

weary of myself and sick of asking

what i am and what i ought to be

at this vessels prow i stand which bears me

forwards forwards oer the starlit sea

i bleed myself to be your drink

is not the blood of poets—ink

so all night long the storm roared on

the morning broke without a sun

in tiny spherule traced with lines

of nature’s geometric signs

in starry flake and pellicle

all day the hoary meteor fell

and when the second morning shone

we looked upon a world unknown

on nothing we could call our own

around the glistening wonder bent

the blue walls of the firmament

no cloud above no earth below—

a universe of sky and snow

call yourself

look deep in the mirror

and say i love you

and immediately

an electric current will

ripple throughout your soul

and burst through your eyes

dancing across the skies

to tell your soul you love it

who you are

after being in a coma

for a hundred years

your face will beam the light

the graves a fine and private place

but none i think do there embrace

steal from the world and not a stone

tell where i lie

but at my back i always hear

time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near

and yonder all before us lie

thy beauty shall no more be found

nor in thy marble vault shall sound

my echoing song then worms shall try

that longpreserved virginity

and your quaint honour turn to dust

and into ashes all my lust

the grave’s a fine and private place

but none i think do there embrace

i hid my love when young till i

couldnt bear the buzzing of a fly

i hid my life to my despite

till i could not bear to look at light

i dare not gaze upon her face

but left her memory in each place

whereer i saw a wild flower lie

i kissed and bade my love goodbye

my hope my heaven my trust must be

my gentle guide in following thee

i have only to contemplate myself man comes from nothing passes through time and disappears forever in the bosom of god he is seen but for a moment wandering on the verge of two abysses and then is lost

i arrived i saw humans and i saw through their faces nothing ever changes but the light in their eyes for i too have buried my demons today without knowing what might remain beneath the face of tomorrow

what is madness but nobility of the soul at odds with circumstance

some of laughter

some of pain

what we would do

if we had the chance to explore

what we had taken for

granted the very day before

some would say im selfish

to hold a little sadness in my eyes

but they dont feel the sorrow

when i cant do

all that helps me feel alive

i can express my emotions

but i cant run wild and free

my mind and soul would handle it

but hell upon my hip ankle and knees

this disorder came about

as a friendship said its last goodbyes

soooo this is what i got given for all the years i stood by

i finally stand still to question it life it is in fact

what the fuck is the purpose of it all if you get stabbed in the back

and after the anger fills the air the regret takes it places

i never wanted to be that girl

horrid sad and faded

so i took with a grain of salt

my new found reality

i am not of my pain

the disability doesnt define me

i find away to adjust

also with the absence of my friend

i trust the choices i make

allow my heart to mend

i pick up the pieces

i retrain my leg

i find where i left off

and i start all over again

you see what happens

when a warrior gets tested

they grow from the ashes

powerful and invested

so i thank all this heartache

as i put it to a rest

i move forward with my life

and ill build a damn good nest

thats what i want that kind of recklessness where the poem is even ahead of you its like riding a horse thats a little too wild for you so theres this tension between what you can do and what the horse decides its going to do

i wait on my fix

i am a poetry junkie

remembrance and reflection how allied

what thin partitions sense from thought divide

be still sad heart and cease repining

behind the clouds is the sun still shining

a way of using words to say things which could not possibly be said in any other way things which in a sense do not exist till they are born … in poetry

o earth lie heavily upon her eyes

seal her sweet eyes weary of watching earth

lie close around her leave no room for mirth

with its harsh laughter nor for sound of sighs

she hath no questions she hath no replies

for you may palm upon us new for old

all as they say that glitters is not gold

know that i loved you and that i belonged to you and i wouldnt have had it any other way

every object every being

is a jar full of delight

be a connoisseur

and taste with caution

any wine will get you high

judge like a king and choose the purest

the ones unadulterated with fear

or some urgency about whats needed

drink the wine that moves you

as a camel moves when its been untied

and is just ambling about

chasing after words like trying to grab the tails of comets

maybe if we reinvent whatever our lives give us we find poems

my heart is small like a love of buttons or black pepper

robots are like mars they need

boys wont do

the memesoup is all wrong they stomp

when they should kiss

and theyre none too keen

on having things shoved inside them

its not a robot

until you put a girl inside sometimes

i feel like that

the company forgot to put a girl in

this is from a tribute poem to ronnie james dio former lead vocalist of the band rainbow black sabbath this is written with all the titles of the hit songs of dio the titles are all in upper case

you can catch the rainbow –

a rainbow in the dark

through rock  roll children

holy diver will lurk

before the fall of electra

all the fools sailed away

jesusmary and the holy ghost

lord of the last day

master of the moon you are

when my one foot in the grave

with our black cold feet

mystery of pain you crave

you’re caught in the middle

between two hearts

when hungry for heaven

hunter of the heart hurts

fallen angels feed my heart

fever dreams feed my head

i am another lie

after all the dead

not guilty if you hide in the rainbow’’

with your perfect guitar solo

don’t tell the kids to dream evil

don’t give her the gun to follow

don’t talk to strangers

those evil eyes can see

lord of the night mistreated

my eyes hate to fancy

shame on the night turn up the night

now it’s time to burn

twisted voodoo does walk on water

and today its our turn

blood from a stone born on the sun

i’m better in the dark breathless

the prisoner of paradise you are

forever you are deathless

laying naked in the rain

this is your life  wild one

your golden rules we gain

in dreams i speed at night

i’m losing my insanity

your heaven and hell my vanity

by killing the dragon

i could have been a dreamer

i’m the last in line to scream

like an invisible screamer

now that you are gone

the end of the world is here

straight through the heart

push just another day in fear

children of the sea  dying in america

is it death by love

faces in the window looking for

a gypsy from above

dear stargazer from strange highways

our love here’s to you

we rock one more for the road

the other world anew

one night in the city with neon knights

the eyes stay out of my mind

the starstruck sunset superman

is what we long to find

the man who would be king

is the institutional man

shoot shoot to turn to stone

when a woman cries to plan

to stand up and shout

before  the king of rock and roll

eat your heart out to reach the goal

from the poem holy dio the diver a tribute to ronnie james dio

life without strife is a rose without thorns

alive as one is thriving today towards tomorrow

nowhere is the past but simply a school of memory

dreams wishes goals then becomes a wheel of wills

spirit of a unique being on each soul breathing

care to ponder some matter or another

over precious moments in a breathing of a soul

all around any season of ones existence one asks

anyone out there

a heart of a soul that didn’t harden

a touch of a soul that didn’t hurt

a life of a soul that didnt love

oasis of a soul from a desert journey

flourishing with endless beauty and security

utmost bliss fulfillment and contentment

under covers a struggling hopeful soul

loving peace and tranquillity passed on to humanity�

poetry isnt like any writing ive ever heard before i dont understand all of it just bits of images sentences that appear halffinished all fluttering together like brightly colored ribbons in the wind

i  will have poetry in my life and adventure and love love above all

if i bet on humanity id never cash a ticket

the future says

i know you are busy with your colourful lives

i have no wish to waste the little time that remains

on arguments and heated debates

but before i can appear

and listen carefully

to what i am about to say

i havent happened yet but i will

i cant pretend its going to be

business as usual

things are going to change

im going to be unrecognisable

please dont open your eyes not yet

im not trying to frighten you

all i ask is that you think of me

not as a wish or a nightmare but as a story

you have to tell yourselves

not with an ending

in which everyone lives happily ever after

or a bmovie apocalypse

but maybe starting with the line

to be continued

and see what happens next

remember this i am not

but in time

so please dont shrug and say

what can we do

its too late etc etc etc

you are such strange creatures

with your greed and your kindness

and your hearts like broken toys

you carry fear with you everywhere

in its box of shadows

you love festivals and music

and good food

you lie to yourselves

because youre afraid of the dark

but the truth is you are in my hands

and i am in yours

we are in this together

face to face and eye to eye

were made for each other

now those of you who are still here

open your eyes and tell me what you see

as a poet and as a mathematician he would reason well as a mere mathematician he could not have reasoned at all

i think it was milosz the polish poet who when he lay in a doorway and watched the bullets lifting the cobbles out of the street beside him realised that most poetry is not equipped for life in a world where people actually die but some is

we love fog because

it shifts old anomalies into the elements

surrounding them it gives relief from a way of seeing

she has learned to love to fear to hate and then to love again through it all she writes once upon a time there was a girl

a poet could kill the dead

the night is still waiting

dream by making and make by dreaming

falling in love was easywhen romantic attraction was combined with hungry unsated desire they formed a glamorous glittering bauble as fragile as it was alluring a bauble that could shatter as soon as it was grasped

tenderness was a different story it had staying power and the promise of a future

that is what you meant to me a light that shone through the darkness your smile p

my best testimonies are from the times i thought i couldnt survive

i love my love with a b because she is peculiar

sprawled out on the front lawn looking up at an ordinary sky it could fall on me and somehow be the day i didnt die

we made love outdoors

without a roof i like most

without stove to make love assuming the weather be fair and balmy and the earth beneath be clean our souls intertwined and gushing of dew

today there are fewer norms that guide that way todays technology seems to threaten the sort of recurring and stable reciprocity that is the building block of trust

the wet brush of snowflakes was like your kisses everywhere

you can make a difference in another persons life and not realize it just by giving them one moment of your time one memory to recall one motion that tells them they are not alone om

every poet finds himself born in the midst of prose he has to struggle from the littleness and obstruction of an actual world into the freedom and infinitude of an ideal

what do they think has happened the old fools

to make them like this  do they somehow suppose

its more grownup when your mouth hangs open and drools

and you keep on pissing yourself and cant remember

who called this morning  or that if they only chose

they could alter things back to when they danced all night

or went to their wedding or sloped arms some september

or do they fancy theres really been no change

and theyve always behaved as if they were crippled or tight

or sat through days of thin continuous dreaming

watching light move  if they dont and they cant its strange

why arent they screaming

at death you break up the bits that were you

start speeding away from each other for ever

with no one to see its only oblivion true

we had it before but then it was going to end

and was all the time merging with a unique endeavour

to bring to bloom the millionpetalled flower

of being here next time you cant pretend

therell be anything else and these are the first signs

not knowing how not hearing who the power

of choosing gone their looks show that theyre for it

ash hair toad hands prune face dried into lines

how can they ignore it

perhaps being old is having lighted rooms

inside your head and people in them acting

people you know yet cant quite name each looms

like a deep loss restored from known doors turning

setting down a iamp smiling from a stair extracting

a known book from the shelves or sometimes only

the rooms themselves chairs and a fire burning

the blown bush at the window or the sun s

faint friendliness on the wall some lonely

rainceased midsummer evening that is where they live

not here and now but where all happened once

this is why they give

an air of baffled absence trying to be there

yet being here for the rooms grow farther leaving

incompetent cold the constant wear and tear

of taken breath and them crouching below

extinction s alp the old fools never perceiving

how near it is this must be what keeps them quiet

the peak that stays in view wherever we go

for them is rising ground can they never tell

what is dragging them back and how it will end  not at night

not when the strangers come  never throughout

the whole hideous inverted childhood well

we shall find out

the old fools

i do not write to you but of youbecause the paper that we write onis our perishable skin

the dreamfence

kittens wait to jump into my dreams

each time i visit heaven

they jump over a dreamfence

red clouds are ready for loving

as i love

my love paints my cats

our minds are somehow stuck together

as we dream together

of our own heaven

amd after tjeu cir i

inside my sweater

we knit our own heavens

so very lovely

his blood on her swollen lips

his first vampire

so very lovely

he would have to remember

each salacious cut

he took her slowly

bled her of secrets and screams

he smiled contemplating

that vampires bled just like whores

it’s not easy to write a poem about a poem

the way it is

there’s a thread you follow it goes among

things that change but it doesn’t change

people wonder about what you are pursuing

you have to explain about the thread

but it is hard for others to see

while you hold it you can’t get lost

or die and you suffer and get old

nothing you do can stop time’s unfolding

you don’t ever let go of the thread

dont you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back

happiness it comes on

unexpectedly and goes beyond really

any early morning talk about it

quote words that affirm

all men and women are your

brothers and sisters

we must listen to poets

the new world is as yet

behind the veil of destiny

in my eyes however

its dawn has been unveiled

why are there trees i never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me

i yearn to make these scars disappear

and to forget about the past

to throw away all of my fears

and to be happy at last

i write in order to comprehend not to express myself

much madness is divinest sense to a discerning eye

higgledy piggledy my black hen

she lays eggs for gentlemen

to count what my black hen doth lay

if perchance she lays too many

they fine my hen a pretty penny

if perchance she fails to lay

the gentlemen a bonus pay

mumbledy pumbledy my red cow

she’s cooperating now

at first she didn’t understand

that milk production must be planned

she didn’t understand at first

she either had to plan or burst

but now the government reports

she’s giving pints instead of quarts

they are giggling at their labors

first they plant the tiny seed

then they water then they weed

then they hoe and prune and lop

they they raise a record crop

then they laugh their sides asunder

and plow the whole caboodle under

abracadabra thus we learn

the more you create the less you earn

the less you earn the more you’re given

the less you lead the more you’re driven

the more destroyed the more they feed

the more you pay the more they need

the more you earn the less you keep

and now i lay me down to sleep

i pray the lord my soul to take

if the taxcollector hasn’t got it before i wake

there is nothing

going on i took nothing

you wanted you cant

have it back

no matter how you feel you have to act

like you are very popular with yourself

very relaxed and purposeful

very unconfused

and not

like you are walking through the sunshine

but neither money nor machines can create they shuttle tokens of energy but they do not transform a civilization based on them puts people out of touch with their creative powers

what happens to a dream deferred

song of myself

smile o voluptuous coolbreathd earth

earth of the slumbering and liquid trees

earth of departed sunsetearth of the mountains mistytopt

earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue

earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river

earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake

farswooping elbowd earthrich appleblossomd earth

smile for your lover comes

enjoy yourselves and hap dont let umber near the arrows and bows hes liable to shoot himself in the nose dodd grinned and snapped the reins and the carriage rolled away

umber sniffed one of his lesser poems come hap

a young gratuitous smile trust and distrust

promiscuities of bed and board and road

the one assured treasure

going down in history is a dead end pursuit

hold your venom

do you recognise the instinct

i will reveal you who i am i am your reflection

they kept me in a cage for too long because now every room i am standing in is just another cell

poetry is the language of the soul

poetic prose the language of my heart

each line must flow as in a song

and strike a chord that rings forever

to me words are music

i want to go to the gym

and pretend the weight machines are drums

and play the longest drum solo on them

i opened my veins unstoppably

life spurts out with no remedy

now i set out bowls and plates

every bowl will be shallow

every plate will be small

and overflowing their rims

into the black earth to nourish

the rushes unstoppably

wherever we go we do harm forgiving

ourselves as wheels do cement for wearing

each other out we set this house

on fire forgetting that we live within

from to a meadowlark for ml smoker

imagination is a very high sort of seeing which does not come by study but by the intellect being where and what it sees by sharing the path or circuits of things through forms and so making them translucid to others

whenever richard cory went down town

we people on the pavement looked at him

he was a gentleman from sole to crown

and he was always quietly arrayed

and he was always human when he talked

but still he fluttered pulses when he said

goodmorning and he glittered when he walked

and he was richyes richer than a king

and admirably schooled in every grace

in fine we thought that he was everything

to make us wish that we were in his place

so on we worked and waited for the light

and went without the meat and cursed the bread

and richard cory one calm summer night

went home and put a bullet through his head

i drink from a small spring

my thirst exceeds the ocean

one can not understand language because language cannot understand itself does not want to understand

poetry is a sort of truancy a dream within the dream of life a wild flower planted among our wheat

i laced my shoes with sorrow

and walked a weary road

dont come undone

with double knots

that walk on air

through vacant lots

your friends and your associates and the people around you and the environment that you live in and the speakers around you  the speakers around you  and the communicators around you are the poetry makers

if your mother tells you stories she is a poetry maker

if your father says stories he is a poetry maker

if your grandma tells you stories she is a poetry maker

and that’s who forms our poetics

even the moon is only poetical because there is a man in the moon

if you do not even understand what words say how can you expect to pass judgement on what words conceal

a poet must discover that it’s his own story that is true even if the truth is small indeed

verses which do not teach men new and moving truths do not deserve to be read

my heart was full of softening showers

i used to swing like this for hours

i did not care for war or death

i was glad to draw my breath

a violent order is disorder and a great disorder is an order

these two things are one

few young poets are testing their poems against the ear theyre writing for the page and the page let me tell you is a cold bed

why does a heart wear its eyes

into hell

i came here to be for all and with all

and what i do today in my solitude

will be echoed tomorrow by the multitude

what i say now with one heart

will be said tomorrow by thousands of hearts

it was not like everyone had said

not like being needed

or needing not desperate

it did not whisper

that id come to harm i didnt lose

my head no i was not

going to leap from a great

height and flap

my wings

it was in fact

the opposite of flying

it contained the wish

to be toppled to be on the floor

the ground anywhere i might

lie down

on my back and you on me

his vision from the constantly passing bars

has grown so weary that it cannot hold

anything else it seems to him there are

a thousand bars and behind the bars no world

as he paces in cramped circles over and over

the movement of his powerful soft strides

is like a ritual dance around a center

in which a mighty will stands paralyzed

only at times the curtain of the pupils

lifts quietly an image enters in

rushes down through the tense arrested muscles

plunges into the heart and is gone

poetry is the scholars art

it’s not possible

on the shining yards of heaven

the eternal slaves of beauty

are the masters of the world

a joy that hurts with sadness

a sadness that is pleasurable

a terror that excites

an excitement that calms

a calmness that frightens

every poet has his dream reader mine keeps a look out for curious prosodic fauna like bacchics and choriambs

we are each what never leaves us what we never see

the back of

is the self but what loves us

is at the back as eurydice was

escorting him out

without his knowing

science ask facts and religion ask faith humans are confused between life and death

i promise i can fly before i hit the ground

it doesnt even hurt anymore

i swear it doesnt hurt

what is it that you love about him

is it the way he lets you down

incapable of lifting you up

is it the way your heart breaks

when he says something

that shatters your selfesteem

is it the fact he never shows up

when you need him

tell me again

what is there to love

about a man who doesnt love you

heres another poem

like all others before and after

dedicated to you

there isnt anything left to be said

but i will spend my life

trying to put you into words

you who is every goodness

and hope

your love is a better fate for me

than anything i could wish for

if you are a part of me

then you’re the best part

and if youre separate from me

then you are my destination

but i’ve become a weary traveller

so please

let us never be apart

love starts as a feeling

but to continue is a choice

and i find myself choosing you

more and more every day

i couldve been your everything

but you didnt have the courage

to love me in the way i needed

in times of crisis we must all decide again and again whom we love

if youre anything like me

you bite your nails

and laugh when youre nervous

you promise people the world

because thats what they want from you

you like giving them what they want

but darling you need to stop

if youre anything like me

you knock on wood every time you make plans

you cross your fingers hold your breath

wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes

your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck

rest in peace to your naive bravado

if life gets too good now

darling it scares you

if youre anything like me

you never wanted to lock your door

your secret garden gate or your diary drawer

didnt want to face the you you dont know anymore

for fear she was much better before

but darling now you have to

if youre anything like me

theres a justice system in your head

for names youll never speak again

and you make your ruthless rulings

each new enemy turns to steel

they become the bars that confine you

in your own little golden prison cell

but darling there is where you meet yourself

if youre anything like me

youve grown to hate your pride

to love your thighs

and no amount of friends at

will fill the empty seats

at the lunch tables of your past

the teams that picked you last

but darling you keep trying

if youre anything like me

you couldnt recognize the face of your love

until they stripped you of your shiny paint

threw your victory flag away

and you saw the ones who wanted you anyway

darling later on you will thank your stars

for that frightful day

if youre anything like me

im sorry

but darling its going to be okay

and in the end

she left a scar

and i knew that was

how she wanted to

be remembered

she wanted to leave

her mark in the

her heart too

attached to it

caution not spirit let it roam wild for in that natural state dance embraces divine frequency

when you return

fallen leaves will climb back into trees

shards of the shattered vase will rise

and reassemble on the table

plastic raincoats will refold

into their flat envelopes the egg

bald yolk and its transparent halo

slide back in the thin calcium shell

curses will pour back into mouths

letters unwrite themselves words

siphoned up into the pen my gray hair

will darken and become the feathers

of a black swan bullets will snap

back into their chambers the powder

will disappear from maps rust

revert to oxygen and time the fire

return to the log the log to the tree

the white root curled up

in the unsplit seed birdsong will fly

into the lark’s lungs answers

become questions again

when you return sweaters will unravel

and wool grow on the sheep

rock will go home to mountain gold

to vein wine crushed into the grape

oil pressed into the olive silk reeled in

to the spider’s belly night moths

tucked close into cocoons ink drained

from the indigo tattoo diamonds

will be returned to coal coal

to rotting ferns rain to clouds light

to stars sucked back and back

into one timeless point the way it was

before the world was born

that fresh that whole nothing

i am sonnets full of stardust within the meter of my skin

do you know where your breakthrough begins your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends

like two stars in the depths of the sky

this gravity is just irresistible

we spin around each other you and i

when i fell for you i fell into your orbit

o how this spring of love resembleth

the uncertain glory of an april day

which now shows all the beauty of the sun

and by and by a cloud takes all away

there are some places you cant visit anymore

poetry and writings take you there

sometimes life requires more of you than you have to give  demands you plunge into the reinvention of yourself if you truly wanna live

after years

today from a distance i saw you

walking away and without a sound

the glittering face of a glacier

slid into the sea an ancient oak

fell in the cumberlands holding only

a handful of leaves and an old woman

scattering corn to her chickens looked up

for an instant at the other side

of the galaxy a star thirtyfive times

the size of our own sun exploded

and vanished leaving a small green spot

on the astronomers retina

as he stood on the great open dome

of my heart with no one to tell

loving you feels like my commitment to eternity a long time ago

go then o my inseperable this once more

i only wrote prose before i met you

my musings were superfluous and serious as well

but now the words dance with me

i sing with them

and we create poetry

i had a dove and the sweet dove died

and i have thought it died of grieving

o what could it grieve for its feet were tied

with a silken thread of my own hands weaving

bees are the batteries of orchards gardens guard them

eagles flight of loneliness soars so high

around its sigh no more alone the sky

other birds remain away clouds pass by

between shrouds of life and haze sun rays die

and some time make the time to drive out west

into county clare along the flaggy shore

in september or october when the wind

and the light are working off each other

so that the ocean on one side is wild

with foam and glitter and inland among stones

the surface of a slategrey lake is lit

by the earthed lightning of a flock of swans

their feathers roughed and ruffling white on white

their fully grown headstronglooking heads

tucked or cresting or busy underwater

useless to think you’ll park and capture it

more thoroughly you are neither here nor there

a hurry through which known and strange things pass

as big soft buffetings come at the car sideways

and catch the heart off guard and blow it open

decide if a poem is a question or a declaration a meditation or an outcry

slogans are mere wordsuck

i left the bank

because they wouldn’t deposit

my cheque of poems

so i went to the store

but they didn’t accept

my currency of words

so i boxed all my stories

and took them to charity

but they refused my donation

and asked me to give blood instead

i opened the notebooks

and made them look what do you think

i wrote these in

and when the dawn comes creeping in

myself to watch the daylight win

only one is a wanderer

and when she was sad shed go into the streets to be with people

i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love

in the afterglow

of an evening rain

i lay down

in the grass

and think of you

my body aches

like an afterkiss

and wildflowers

my dear

i will always be

this tender for you

im glad to be alive

in a world where

his gently awakening eyes

nourish the morning sun

she loved me

and inspired me

with transcending devotion

it was a blessing

to have been her son

to have been loved

her words of wisdom

opened my eyes

to the world

and to myself

by seeing the best in me

she empowered me

by believing in me

she transformed me

she grew old

and floated away

but her love remains standing

eternally by my side

a silent night  the most eloquent poem i have ever read

catch and carry

ash and ember

ash and oak

bide and borrow

stone and stave

wind and water

how they had dreamed together he and she how they had planned and laughed and loved they had lived for a while in the very heart of poetry

how blest am i in this discovering thee

to enter in these bonds is to be free

then where my hand is set my seal shall be

full nakedness all joys are due to thee

as souls unbodied bodies unclothed must be

early morning in your room

its morning the brown scoops of coffee the wasplike

coffee grinder the neighbors still asleep

the gray light as you pour gleaming water

it seems youve traveled years to get here

finally you deserve a house if not deserve

it have it no one can get you out misery

had its way poverty no money at least

or maybe it was confusion but thats over

now you have a room those lighthearted books

the anatomy of melancholy kafkas letter

to his father are all here you can dance

with only one leg and see the snowflake falling

with only one eye even the blind man

can see thats what they say if you had

a sad childhood so what when robert burton

said he was melancholy he meant he was home

let your love flow where the beautiful things are and something beautiful will always come your way

the aim of science is to make difficult things understandable in a simpler way the aim of poetry is to state simple things in an incomprehensible way the two are incompatible

if i feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off i know that is poetry

there have been times ive felt so much art in my soul i grew sick of artists

i have no riches but my thoughts

yet these are wealth enough for me

my true love hath my heart and i have his

none ever was in love with me but grief

she wooed me from the day that i was born

she stole my playthings first the jealous thief

and left me there forlorn

the birds that in my garden would have sung

she scared away with her unending moan

she slew my lovers too when i was young

and left me there alone

grief i have cursed thee often—now at last

to hate thy name i am no longer free

caught in thy bony arms and prisoned fast

i love no love but thee

let me remember you soon will the winter be on us

snowhushed and heartless

what if i fall oh my darling but if you fly

spend all you have for loveliness

buy it and never count the cost

for one white singing hour of peace

and for a breath of ecstasy

give all you have been or could be

the truth the

all moving magic the

spark of it all was

and this saved my life

what do i care in the dreams and the languor of spring

that my songs do not show me at all

for they are a fragrance and i am a flint and a fire

i am an answer they are only a call

by the craggy hillside

through the mosses bare

they have planted thorntrees

for pleasure here and there

if any man so daring

as dig them up in spite

he shall find their sharpest thorns

in his bed at night

the business of love is

cruelty which

by our wills

we transform

to live together

some people

some people flee some other people

in some country under a sun

and some clouds

they abandon something close to all they’ve got

sown fields some chickens dogs

mirrors in which fire now preens

their shoulders bear pitchers and bundles

the emptier they get the heavier they grow

what happens quietly someone’s dropping from exhaustion

what happens loudly someone’s bread is ripped away

someone tries to shake a limp child back to life

always another wrong road ahead of them

across an oddly reddish river

around them some gunshots now nearer now farther away

above them a plane seems to circle

some invisibility would come in handy

some grayish stoniness

or better yet some nonexistence

for a shorter or a longer while

something else will happen only where and what

someone will come at them only when and who

in how many shapes with what intentions

if he has a choice

maybe he won’t be the enemy

and will leave them to some sort of life

was a suncheek or brow of the morning star

shake the dust off your sleeve carefully

that too was a delicate fair face

then all the charm

is brokenall that phantomworld so fair

vanishes and a thousand circlets spread

and each misshape the other

if i must go

if i must go to heavens end

climbing the ages like a stair

be near me and forever bend

with the same eyes above me there

time will fly past us like leaves flying

we shall not heed for we shall be

knowing and known unchangeably

here’s a hand to the boy who has courage

to do what he knows to be right

when he falls in the way of temptation

he has a hard battle to fight

who strives against self and his comrade

will find a most powerful foe

all honor to him if he conquers

a cheer for the boy who says no

there’s many a battle fought daily

the world knows nothing about

there’s many a brave little soldier

whose strength puts a legion to rout

and he who fights sin singlehanded

is more of a hero i say

than he who leads soldiers to battle

and conquers by arms in the fray

be steadfast my boy when you’re tempted

to do what you know to be right

stand firm by the colors of manhood

and you will o’ercome in the fight

the right be your battle cry ever

in waging the warfare of life

and god who knows who are the heroes

will give you the strength for the strife

don’t say that poetry my friend is beautiful

or powerful

for there is no powerful or beautiful poetry

there is poetry that strikes you secretly

with the diseases of writing and schizophrenia and you rave

and your self leaves you for another

i wanted to write some words youd remember

words so alert theyd leap from the paper

crawl up your shoulder lie by your ears

and purr themselves to you like baby kittens

but it was rainy so i laid there and daydreamed about you

when

when it’s over it’s over and we don’t know

any of us what happens then

so i try not to miss anything

i think in my whole life i have never missed

the full moon

or the slipper of its coming back

or a kiss

to pray you open your whole self

to sky to earth to sun to moon

to one whole voice that is you

and know there is more

that you cant see cant hear

cant know except in moments

steadly growing and in languages

that arent always sound but other

like eagle that sunday morning

in wind swept our hearts clean

with sacred wings

we see you see ourselves and know

that we must take the utmost care

and kindness in all things

breathe in knowing we are made of

all this and breathe knowing

we are truly blessed because we

were born and die soon within a

like eagle rounding out the morning

we pray that it will be done

if springtime crawls out of the

wild mouths of flowers then

surely winter crawls out of mine

when it comes you’ll be dreaming

that you don’t need to breathe

that breathless silence is

the music of the dark

and it’s part of the rhythm

to vanish like a spark

the first kiss and the first glass of wine are the best

defy the space that separates the nation october

the past to go away i wanted

to leave it like another country i wanted

my life to close and open

like a hinge like a wing like the part of the song

where it falls

down over the rocks an explosion a discovery

to hurry into the work of my life i wanted to know

whoever i was i was

for a little while

…mostly i want to be kind

and nobody of course is kind

or mean

for a simple reason

and nobody gets out of it having to

swim through the fires to stay in

this world

kiss me so long but as a kiss may last

you are not worthless even if youve been called that your entire life

i was satisfied with haiku until i met you jar of octopus cuckoos cry  but now i want a russian novel a page description of you sleeping another  of what you think staring at your window

shes always looking for poetry and passion and sensitivity the whole romantic kitchen i live on a rather simpler diet

prose and pudding

i dont expect attractive men necessarily to have attractive souls

student of our sweet english tongue

read out my words at night alone

i was a poet i was young

since i can never see your face

and never shake you by the hand

i send my soul through time and space

to greet you you will understand

i do not write poetry i take words and dip them in feelings

base words are uttered only by the base

and can for such at once be understood

but noble platitudes — ah theres a case

where the most careful scrutiny is needed

to tell a voice thats genuinely good

from one thats base but merely has succeeded

for a game you don’t need a teacher

in the very essence of poetry there is something indecent a thing brought forth that we didnt know we had in us so we blink our eyes as if a tiger had sprung out and stood in the light licking its tail

april is the cruelest month breeding

lilacs out of the dead land mixing

memory and desire stirring

dull roots with spring rain

a little life with dried tubers

summer surprised us coming over the starnbergersee

with a shower of rain we stopped in the colonnade

and went on in sunlight into the hofgarten

and drank coffee and talked for an hour

and when we were children staying at the archdukes

my cousins he took me out on a sled

and i was frightened he said marie

marie hold on tight and down we went

in the mountains there you feel free

i read much of the night and go south in the winter

some who grow dull religious straight commence

and gain in morals what they lose in sense

henceforth an individual solace dear

part of my soul i seek thee and thee claim

my other half with that thy gentle hand

seisd mine i yielded and from that time see

how beauty is excelld by manly grace

straight between them ran the pathway

never grew the grass upon it

because we had survived

sisters and brothers daughters and sons

we discovered bones that rose

from the dark earth and sang

as white birds in the trees

because the story of our life

becomes our life

because each of us tells the same story

but tells it differently

and none of us tells it the same way twice   from why we tell stories

we want it visible

to show

when even the most

will reveal itself

only when we have

transformed it within

there’s nowhere my love the

world can exist

different languages the same thoughts servant to thoughts and their masters

in an old family album

ever again you return melancholy

o meekness of the solitary soul

a golden day glows and expires

humbly the patient man surrenders to pain

ringing with melodious sound and soft madness

look theres the twilight

night returns once more and a mortal thing laments

and another suffers in sympathy

yearly the head is bowed deeper

a poet is simply an artist whose medium is human emotions  a poet chisels away at our own sensibilities shaping our vision while molding our hearts  a poet wraps words around our own feelings and presents them as fresh gifts to humanity

i began a poem in lines of one syllable its rather difficult but the merit of all things lies in their difficulty the subject matter is gallant ill read you the first canto its four hundred verses long and takes one minute

once upon a time

i fell in love

lost myself

and find another one

is there life before death that’s chalked up

in ballymurphy competence with pain

coherent miseries a bite and a sup

we hug our little destiny again

i feel the only thing you can do about life is to preserve it by art if youre an artist by children if youre not

the poet…is the man of metaphor while the philosopher is interested only in the truth of meaning beyond even signs and names and the sophist manipulates empty signs…the poet plays on the multiplicity of signifieds

i will turn human anatomy into roses and stars and sea i will dissect the beloveds body in metaphor

how can the bird that is born for joy

sit in a cage and sing

how can a child when fears annoy

but droop his tender wing

and forget his youthful spring

where some god pissed a rain of

reason to make things grow

only to die

be ahead of all parting as though it already were

behind you like the winter that has just gone by

for among these winters there is one so endlessly winter

that only by wintering through it will your heart survive

poetry is as necessary to comprehension as science it is as impossible to live without reverence as it is without joy

so live that when thy summons comes to join the innumerable caravan which moves

to that mysterious realm where each shall take his chamber in the silent halls of death thou go not like the quarryslave at nightscourged to his dungeon but sustaind and soothed

by an unfaltering trust approach thy gravelike one who wraps the drapery of his couch about him and lies down to pleasant dreams

this is where i belong burning in these flames for everything i have done wrong i know i am to blame

i went down not long ago

to the mad river under the willows

i knelt and drank from that crumpled flow call it

what madness you will theres a sickness

worse than the risk of death and thats

forgetting what we should never forget

tecumseh lived here

the wounds of the past

are ignored but hang on

like the litter that snags among the yellow branches

newspapers and plastic bags after the rains

where are the shawnee now

do you know or would you have to

write to washington and even then

whatever they said

would you believe it sometimes

i would like to paint my body red and go into

the glittering snow

his name meant shooting star

from mad river country north to the border

he gathered the tribes

and armed them one more time he vowed

to keep ohio and it took him

over twenty years to fail

after the bloody and final fighting at thames

it was over except

his body could not be found

and you can do whatever you want with that say

his people came in the black leaves of the night

and hauled him to a secret grave or that

he turned into a little boy again and leaped

into a birch canoe and went

rowing home down the rivers anyway

this much im sure of if we meet him well know it

he will still be

so angry

music when combined with a pleasurable idea is poetry music without the idea is simply music the idea without the music is prose from its very definitiveness

the first year was like icing then the cake started to show through …

theres a book of poetry

in the lines of my hands

that no one wants to read

these poems with all their crudities doubts and confusions are written for the love of man and in praise of god and id be a damn fool if they werent

the campus an academy of trees

under which some hand the winds i guess

had scattered the pale light

petals stained with pink veins

secret blooming for themselves

we sat among them

your long fingers thin body

and long bones of improbable genius

some scattered gene as kafka must have had

your deep voice this passing dust of miracles

that simple that was myself half conscious

as though each moment was a page

where words appeared the bent hammer of the type

struck against the moving ribbon

the light air the restless leaves

the ripple of time warped by our longing

there as if we were painted

by some unknown impressionist

ah the freshness in the face of leaving a task undone

to be remiss is to be positively out in the country

what a refuge it is to be completely unreliable

i can breathe easier now that the appointments are behind me

i missed them all through deliberate negligence

having waited for the urge to go which i knew wouldn’t come

i’m free and against organized clothed society

i’m naked and plunge into the water of my imagination

it’s too late to be at either of the two meetings where i should have been at the same time

deliberately at the same time

no matter i’ll stay here dreaming verses and smiling in italics

this spectator aspect of life is so amusing

i can’t even light the next cigarette if it’s an action

it can wait for me along with the others in the nonmeeting called life

i have brushed my teeth

this day and i are even

poetry and art nourish the soul of the world with the flavorfilled substances of beauty wisdom and truth

there is nothing like scrubbing toilets for a living to make you question the choices you have made in life

her belly ruptures full of parasites

her eyes sink back in her skull

from the edge of the bathtub

her children cuddle against her desperate for love she cannot give

i didnt exist at creation

i didnt exist at the flood

and i wont be around for salvation

to sort out the sheep from the cud

or whatever the phrase is the fact is

im a crude existential malpractice

and you are a diet of worms

our friends through cables and computer screens are as real as the light and sound waves we alter through thought

i’ve been here before dreaming myself

true to the seasons i’ve lived every word

spoken did i walk into someone’s nightmare

in this universe there are no time machines or keys that can turn hearts back around

holding a tiny dixie cup in my hand makes me feel like a giant human being that can crush things

seeing a woman cough today made me sense a vague fear of death

i could not have climbed any mountains while looking from the ground i would not have flown or dived or surfed or swum i am not a tourist nor a spectator this is the life i have left and i will not waste it like some rubberneck

and this gray spirit yearning in desire

to follow knowledge like a sinking star

beyond the utmost bound of human thought

again i see you but me i dont see the magical mirror in which i saw myself has been broken and only a piece of me i see in each fatal fragment  only a piece of you and me

i searched for my own heart

and long after i had lost my way

in the days trailing past with their foliage

in the aloof sky blue with distance

i thought id find my heart

where id kept your eyes two brown butterflies

and i saw the swallows swoop

and shadows starlings

all war is based in deception cfr sun tzu the art of war

definition of deception the practice of deliberately making somebody believe things that are not true an act a trick or device entended to deceive somebody

thus all war is based in metaphor

all war necessarily perfects itself in poetry

poetry since indefinable is the sense of seduction

therefore all war is the storytelling of seduction and seduction is the nature of war

the muffled syllables that nature speaks

fill us with deeper longing for her word

she hides a meaning that the spirit seeks

she makes a sweeter music than is heard

bright star would i were steadfast as thou art

not in lone splendour hung aloft the night

and watching with eternal lids apart

like natures patient sleepless eremite

isnt joyful or painful this pain in which i rejoice

historical sense and poetic sense should not in the end be contradictory for if poetry is the little myth we make history is the big myth we live and in our living constantly remake

the vagabond

give to me the life i love

let the lave go by me

give the jolly heaven above

and the byway nigh me

bed in the bush with stars to see

bread i dip in the river

theres the life for a man like me

theres the life for ever

let the blow fall soon or late

let what will be oer me

give the face of earth around

and the road before me

wealth i seek not hope nor love

nor a friend to know me

all i seek the heaven above

and the road below me

or let autumn fall on me

where afield i linger

silencing the bird on tree

biting the blue finger

white as meal the frosty field

warm the fireside haven

not to autumn will i yield

not to winter even

let the blow fall soon or late

let what will be oer me

give the face of earth around

and the road before me

wealth i ask not hope nor love

nor a friend to know me

all i ask the heaven above

and the road below me

song of myself

i have heard what the talkers were talking the talk of the

beginning and the end

but i do not talk of the beginning or the end

there was never any more inception than there is now

nor any more youth or age than there is now

and will never be any more perfection than there is now

nor any more heaven or hell than there is now

just know i am

not there to catch you

but i am there for you

the ballpoint penguins black and white

do little else but write and write

although theyve nothing much to say

they write and write it anyway

we wrote our names in the sand

you crossed mine out i cant get

back to the way i was

paris and helen

he called her golden dawn

she called him the wind whistles

he called her heart of the sky

she called him message bringer

he called her mother of pearl

flax princess allmaker weef

she called him fawn roebuck

allingreen mountain strider

keeper of forests myloverides

he called her the tree is

she called him bird dancing

he called her who stands

has stood will always stand

she called him arriver

he called her the heart and the womb

are similar

she called him arrow in my heart

ô take this eager dance you fool

don’t brandish your stick at me

i have several reasons to travel on

on to the endless sea

i have lost my love i’ve drunk my purse

my girl has gone and left me rags to sleep upon

these old man’s gloves conceal the hands with which i’ve killed but one

poets to come

poets to come orators singers musicians to come

not today is to justify me and answer what i am for

but you a new brood native athletic continental greater than before known

for you must justify me

you must answer

i myself but write one or two indicative words for the future

i but advance a moment only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness

i am a man who sauntering along without fully stopping turns a casual look upon you and then averts his face

leaving it to you to prove and define it

expecting the main things from you

the very essence of i is being killed by you

in this quiet place on a quiet street

where no one ever finds us

gently lovingly freedom gives back our pain

from poem in a quiet place on a quiet street

an anaesthetic is a poetkiller

we speak in rich monotones our poetry is haunted by the music it has left behind orpheus shrinks to a poet when he looks back with the impatience of reason on a music stronger than death

he remembers which sister

i like least and asks

how she is doing

lines  of the poem divorce

loves language is imprecise

fits more like mittens than gloves

and here face down beneath the sun

and here upon earths noonward height

to feel the always coming on

the always rising of the night

the presocratic problem

all snap flags

parmenides named his gun the hot power of the stars his gun was one uncreated imperishable timeless changeless perfect spherical spherical was the problem

one could say that artists are people who think naturally in highly patterned ways

o rose you look sick

o rose wake up and sing

a writer is not so much someone who has something to say as he is someone who has found a process that will bring about new things he would not have thought of if he had not started to say them

i have defined poetry as a passionate pursuit of the real

poetry three mismatched shoes at the entrance of a dark alley

therefore since the world has still

much good but much less good than ill

and while the sun and moon endure

lucks a chance but troubles sure

id face it as a wise man would

and train for ill and not for good

o what a panics in thy breastie

this is the creature there has never been

they never knew it and yet none the less

they loved the way it moved its suppleness

its neck its very gaze mild and serene

not there because they loved it it behaved

as though it were they always left some space

and in that clear unpeopled space they saved

it lightly reared its head with scarce a trace

of not being there they fed it not with corn

but only with the possibility

of being and that was able to confer

such strength its brow put forth a horn one horn

whitely it stole up to a maid  to be

within the silver mirror and in her

that your power of command

with simple language was

one of the magnificent things of

our century

from the poem result

take the time to write you can do your lifes work in half an hour a day

and i or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth

but for us the road unfurls itself we dont stop walking we know there is far to go

we are all oldtimers

each of us holds a locked razor

you campaign in poetry you govern in prose

she dotes on poetry sir she adores it i may say that her whole soul and mind are wound up and entwined with it she has produced some delightful pieces herself sir you may have met with her ode to an expiring frog sir

i have to live with myself and so i want to be fit for myself to know

every poem i write falls short in some important way but i go on trying to write the one that won’t

ive given offense by saying id as soon write free verse as play tennis with the net down

when the heart stops oozing blood

the outpouring is clear as water

so to speak then you know youve

turned the corner  will be well

when you look inward  all pathways

are no longer dark but clearly lighted

then you know youll find your way alone

when the gray morning has nothing to do

with you  doesnt weigh you down

like a heavy blanket then you know

that moving will be easy again and

your body will flow through time

like the river it really is smooth  deep

no rocks no shallows to smash or catch you

keep you from moving on

when the heart slows

to its normal rhythm and the beauty

of birdsong at dawn doesnt make you cry

because you are alone listening then you

know that everything has happened that is

going to for now and you can get on with

your life  everything about it that was

yours alone and always finer than

anyone could ever imagine it would be

without him

as she laughed i was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and being part of it until her teeth were only accidental stars with a talent for squaddrill

what the manmoth fears most he must do

maybe if i could slip into sylvias mind sort out the spices in her rack alphabetize them and dust them off maybe then id understand how its the little things that pull you under

at any moment you know your manufactured cool could blow

we do not play on graves—

because there isnt room—

besides—it isnt even—it slants

and people come—

and put a flower on it—

and hang their faces so—

were fearing that their hearts will drop—

and crush our pretty play—

and so we move as far

as enemies—away—

just looking round to see how far

it is—occasionally—

a wind starts to blow without feelings

a life will begin in melodies of the strings

may you find all pleasure of the light

criticism is like politics if you dont make your own you are by default accepting the status quo and are finally yourself responsible for whatever the status quo does to you

a word is elegy to what it signifies

you cant

just because

the night never

seems to

poets are interested primarily in death and commas

life is just a slide back and forth between loving and leaving remembering and forgetting holding on and letting go

in their effort to divorce language and experience deconstructionist critics remind me of middleclass parents who do not allow their children to play in the street

one way poetry connects is across time    some echo of a writers physical experience comes into us when we read her poem

when i throw back my head and howl

but youve always done what you want

you always get your way

a perfectly vile and foul

inversion of all thats been

what the old ratbags mean

is ive never done what i dont

so the shit in the shuttered chateau

who does his five hundred words

then parts out the rest of the day

between bathing and booze and birds

is far off as ever but so

is that spectacled schoolteaching sod

six kids and the wife in pod

and her parents coming to stay

life is an immobile locked

threehanded struggle between

your wants the worlds for you and worse

the unbeatable slow machine

that brings what youll get blocked

they strain round a hollow stasis

of havingsto fear faces

days sift down it constantly years

the life with the hole in it

it’s not the word made flesh we want in writing in poetry and fiction but the flesh made word

i never understood desire until i felt your hands around my throat

a poet is someone who can use a single image to send a universal message

my house burned down

but anyway it was after

the flower petals had already fallen

if i when my wife is sleeping

and the baby and kathleen

are sleeping

and the sun is a flamewhite disc

above shining trees

if i in my north room

before my mirror

waving my shirt round my head

and singing softly to myself

i am lonely lonely

i was born to be lonely

i am best so

if i admire my arms my face

my shoulders flanks buttocks

against the yellow drawn shades

who shall say i am not

the happy genius of my household

the princess

jumped from

the tower

she

that she

all along

she never needed those wings

the southwind brings

life sunshine and desire

and on every mount and meadow

but over the dead he has no power

the lost the lost he cannot restore

and looking over the hills i mourn

the darling who shall not return

to the bottle in the ditch to the scoop

in the oats to air in the lung

let it come as it will and dont

be afraid god does not leave us

comfortless so let evening come

i dont like a kind of workshop that is about editingi dont want to sit there and be an editor i dont want to tell someone how to fix a poem

dont be afraid of poetry

your ability to make me feel like i was less than i was took awhile to recover from but after ripping my own self worth to shreds for so long i realized that i wasnt less just because i was more than your inexperienced hands could handle

once a poet calls his myth a myth he prevents the reader from treating it as a reality we use the word myth only for stories we ourselves cannot believe

even the most political poem is an act of faith

god must be a season grandma said looking out at the blizzard drowning

my footsteps on the sidewalk were the smallest flights

dear god if you are a season let it be the one i passed through

to get here

here thats all i wanted to be

ignorance and virtue suck on the same straw

this is definitely  for the brothers  who aint here

i have had to learn the simplest things

last which made for difficulties

you shine like love

you shine like hate

until i can’t remember the difference

written in pencil in the sealed railwaycar

here in this carload

i am eve

with abel my son

if you see my other son

tell him that i

the gentle downward slope gets steeper

and imperceptibly becomes an abyss

may your love for me be

the scent of the evening sea

through a quiet window

so i do not have to run

or chase or fall

to feel you

all i have to do

the one

who will jolt awake

all the unwritten

the unsung

and the unlived

i am waiting

for him

i hope that

whoever you are

wherever you are

and no matter how

you are feeling

you will always

to smile about

from her thighs she gives you life

and how you treat she who gives you life

shows how much you value the life given to you by the creator

and from seed to dust

there is one soul above all others

that you must always show patience respect and trust

and this woman is your mother

and when your soul departs your body

and your deeds are weighed against the feather

there is only one soul who can save yours

and this woman is your mother

and when the heart of the universe

asks her hair and mind

whether you were gentle and kind to her

her heart will be forced to remain silent

and her hair will speak freely as a separate entity

very much like the seaweed in the sea

it will reveal all that it has heard and seen

this woman whose heart has seen yours

first before anybody else in the world

and whose womb had opened the door

for your eyes to experience light and more

is your very own mother

so no matter whether your mother has been cruel

manipulative abusive mentally sick or simply childish

how you treat her is the ultimate test

if she misguides you forgive her and show her the right way

with simple wisdom gentleness and kindness

and always remember

that the queen in the creators kingdom

who sits on the throne of all existence

is exactly the same as in yours

and her name is

the divine mother

be the kiss in my hair

that no one sees

move when i move

sigh when i sigh

be that line from a poem

that i hold in my eyes

and the afterglow

of your gazeis the only

sweater that i need

i will learn your anger i will lick your sadness

i will feast on your hunger

life this morning the sun made me adore it it had behind the dripping pine trees the oriental brightness orange and crimson of a living being a rose and an apple in the physical and ideal fusion of a true and daily paradise

and if sun comes

how shall we greet him

shall we not dread him

shall we not fear him

after so lengthy a

session with shade

though we have wept for him

though we have prayed

all through the nightyears—

what if we wake one shimmering morning to

hear the fierce hammering

of his firm knuckles

hard on the door

shall we not shudder—

shall we not flee

into the shelter the dear thick shelter

of the familiar

sweet is it sweet is it

to sleep in the coolness

the dark hangs heavily

over the eyes

i have forgot much cynara gone with the wind

flung roses roses riotously with the throng

dancing to put thy pale lost lilies out of mind

but i was desolate and sick of an old passion

yea all the time because the dance was long

i have been faithful to thee cynara in my fashion

i cried for madder music and for stronger wine

but when the feast is finished and the lamps expire

then falls thy shadow cynara the night is thine

and i am desolate and sick of an old passion

yea hungry for the lips of my desire

i have been faithful to thee cynara in my fashion

poetry is breathing words that give a reader pause

time goes by time comes along

all is old and all is new

what is right and what is wrong

you must think and ask of you

have no hope and have no fear

waves that rise can never hold

if they urge or if they cheer

you remain aloof and cold

to our sight a lot will glisten

many sounds will reach our ear

who could take the time to listen

and remember all we hear

keep aside from all that patter

seek yourself far from the throng

when with loud and idle clatter

time goes by time comes along

nor forget the tongue of reason

or its even scales depress

when the moment changing season

wears the mask of happiness

it is born of reasons slumber

and may last a wink as true

for the one who knows its number

all is old and all is new

be as to a play spectator

as the world unfolds before

you will know the heart of matter

should they act two parts or four

when they cry or tear asunder

from your seat enjoy along

and youll learn from art to wonder

what is right and what is wrong

past and future ever blending

are the twin sides of same page

new start will begin with ending

when you know to learn from age

all that was or be tomorrow

we have in the present too

but whats vain and futile sorrow

you must think and ask of you

for the living cannot sever

from the means weve always had

now as years ago and ever

men are happy or are sad

other masks same play repeated

diffrent tongues same words to hear

of your dreams so often cheated

have no hope and have no fear

hope not when the villains cluster

by success and glory drawn

fools with perfect lack of luster

will outshine hyperion

fear it not theyll push each other

to reach higher in the fold

do not side with them as brother

waves that rise can never hold

life attracts you into eddies

to change actors in the play

steal aside from crowd and bustle

do not look seem not to hear

from your path away from hustle

if they urge or if they cheer

if they reach for you go faster

hold your tongue when slanders yell

your advice they cannot master

dont you know their measure well

let them talk and let them chatter

let all go past young and old

unattached to man or matter

you remain aloof and cold

you remain aloof and cold

if they urge or if they cheer

waves that rise can never hold

have no hope and have no fear

you must think and ask of you

what is right and what is wrong

all is old and all is new

time goes by time comes along

how does a poet know when a poem is ended because it lies flat taut nothing can be added or subtracted how does a woman know when a marriage is over because of the way her life suddenly shears off in just two directions past and future

i was not sorrowful but only tired

of everything that ever i desired

later that night she picked the polish off

with her front teeth until the bed you shared

for seven years seemed speckled with glitter

and blood

i many times thought peace had come

when peace was far away

as wrecked men deem they sight the land

at centre of the sea

and struggle slacker but to prove

as hopelessly as i

how many the fictitious shores

before the harbor lie

since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea

but sad mortality o’ersways their power

how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea

whose action is no stronger than a flower

o how shall summer’s honey breath hold out

against the wrackful siege of battering days

when rocks impregnable are not so stout

nor gates of steel so strong but time decays

o fearful meditation where alack

shall time’s best jewel from time’s chest lie hid

or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back

or who his spoil of beauty can forbid

o none unless this miracle have might

that in black ink my love may still shine bright

be true to your word and your work and your friend

the fury of confession at first

then the fury of clarity

it was from you death that such hypocritical

obscure feeling was born and now

let them accuse me of every passion

let them badmouth me let them say i’m deformed

you isolate me you give me the certainty of life

i’m on the stake i play the card of fire

and i win this little immense goodness of mine

i can do it for i have suffered you too much

i return to you as an émigré returns

to his own country and rediscovers it

i made a fortune in the intellect

and i’m happy as i once was

destitute of any norm

a black rage of poetry in my breast

once your joy was confused with terror

it’s true and now almost with other joy

livid and arid my passion deluded

now you really frighten me

for you are truly close to me

part of my angry state of obscure hunger

of the anxiety almost of a new being

ah lalage while life is ours

hoard not thy beauty rose and white

but pluck the pretty fleeing flowers

that deck our little path of light

for all too soon we twain shall tread

the bitter pastures of the dead

estranged sad spectres of the night

born into this

into hospitals which are so expensive that its cheaper to die

into lawyers who charge so much its cheaper to plead guilty

into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed

into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes

my thoughts i think will soon be sound

my mind i hope will soon be found

to hope

how shall i lure thee to my haunts forlorn

for me wilt thou renew the wither’d rose

and clear my painful path of pointed thorn

ah come sweet nymph in smiles and softness drest

like the young hours that lead the tender year

enchantress come and charm my cares to rest—

alas the flatterer flies and will not hear

a prey to fear anxiety and pain

must i a sad existence still deplore

lo—the flowers fade but all the thorns remain

for me the vernal garland blooms no more

come then pale misery’s love be thou my cure

and i will bless thee who tho’ slow art sure

i sometimes think you despise poetry said phineas

when it is false i do the difficulty is to know when it is false and when it is true

i throw myself away so no one

not even you can have me

taste that on your lips eat

the bitter fruit of my parting

i am already too far away

i am

i am—yet what i am none cares or knows

my friends forsake me like a memory lost

i am the selfconsumer of my woes—

they rise and vanish in oblivious host

like shadows in love’s frenzied stifled throes

and yet i am and live—like vapours tossed

into the nothingness of scorn and noise

into the living sea of waking dreams

where there is neither sense of life or joys

but the vast shipwreck of my life’s esteems

even the dearest that i loved the best

are strange—nay rather stranger than the rest

a place where woman never smiled or wept

there to abide with my creator god

and sleep as i in childhood sweetly slept

untroubling and untroubled where i lie

the grass below—above the vaulted sky

the bed we loved in was a spinning world

where we would dive for pearls my lover’s words

were shooting stars which fell to earth as kisses

on these lips my body now a softer rhyme

to his now echo assonance his touch

a verb dancing in the centre of a noun

some nights i dreamed he’d written me the bed

a page beneath his writer’s hands romance

and drama played by touch by scent by taste

in the other bed the best our guests dozed on

dribbling their prose my living laughing love

i hold him in the casket of my widow’s head

as he held me upon that next best bed

i know the world is still out there and i know im not yet friendly to its pace but as long as i know him with me here there somewhere – us – i know i have a chance

though i play at the edges of knowing

our part is not knowing

but looking and touching and loving

door of passage to the other side the soul frees itself in stride

gather ye rosebuds while ye may

old time is still aflying

and this same flower that smiles today

tomorrow will be dying

depressionthe assassin inside me

crowded places i shunned them as noises too rude

and fled to the silence of sweet solitude

have you suffered starved and triumphed grovelled down yet grasped at glory

grown bigger in the bigness of the whole

done things just for the doing letting babblers tell the story

seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul

have you seen god in his splendours heard the text that nature renders

youll never hear it in the family pew

the simple things the true things the silent men who do things–

then listen to the wild–its calling you

i have daughters and i have sons

when one of them lays a hand

on my shoulder shining fish

turn suddenly in the deep sea

when we walk in the sun

our shadows are like barges of silence

only our love hath no decay

this no tomorrow hath nor yesterday

running it never runs from us away

but truly keeps his first last everlasting day

many women are singing together of this

one is in a shoe factory cursing the machine

one is at the aquarium tending a seal

one is dull at the wheel of her ford

one is at the toll gate collecting

one is tying the cord of a calf in arizona

one is straddling a cello in russia

one is shifting pots on the stove in egypt

one is painting her bedroom walls moon color

one is dying but remembering a breakfast

one is stretching on her mat in thailand

one is wiping the ass of her child

one is staring out the window of a train

in the middle of wyoming and one is

anywhere and some are everywhere and all

seem to be singing although some can not

thus though we cannot make our sun

stand still yet we will make him run

the flight

look back with longing eyes and know that i will follow

lift me up in your love as a light wind lifts a swallow

let our flight be far in sun or blowing rain

but what if i heard my first love calling me again

hold me on your heart as the brave sea holds the foam

take me far away to the hills that hide your home

peace shall thatch the roof and love shall latch the door

but what if i heard my first love calling me once more

foggy nights bring some comfort

he can get lost in the mist

and there is no one to stare or question

we can make our lives sublime

and departing leave behind us

footprints on the sand of time

footprints that perhaps another

sailing oer lifes solenm main

a forlorn and shipwrecked brother

seeing shall take heart again

let us then be up and doing

with a heart for any fate

learn to labor and to wait

but at my back i always hear

time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near

and yonder all before us lie

the taxi

when i go away from you

the world beats dead

i call out for you against the jutted stars

and shout into the ridges of the wind

one after the other

wedge you away from me

and the lamps of the city prick my eyes

so that i can no longer see your face

why should i leave you

to wound myself upon the sharp edges of the night

my name

once when the lawn was a golden green

and the marbled moonlit trees rose like fresh memorials

in the scented air and the whole countryside pulsed

with the chirr and murmur of insects i lay in the grass

feeling the great distances open above me and wondered

what i would become and where i would find myself

and though i barely existed i felt for an instant

that the vast starclustered sky was mine and i heard

my name as if for the first time heard it the way

one hears the wind or the rain but faint and far off

as though it belonged not to me but to the silence

from which it had come and to which it would go

was venus more beautiful

than you are

when she topped

the crinkled waves

on her plaited shell

was botticelli’s vision

and were the painted rosebuds

he tossed his lady

than the words i blow about you

to cover your too great loveliness

as with a gauze

for me

you stand poised

in the blue and buoyant air

cinctured by bright winds

treading the sunlight

and the waves which precede you

ripple and stir

the sands at my feet

my truelove hath my heart and i have his

by just exchange one for the other given

i hold his dear and mine he cannot miss

there never was a bargain better driven

his heart in me keeps me and him in one

my heart in him his thoughts and senses guides

he loves my heart for once it was his own

i cherish his because in me it bides

his heart his wound received from my sight

my heart was wounded with his wounded heart

for as from me on him his hurt did light

so still methought in me his hurt did smart

both equal hurt in this change sought our bliss

my truelove hath my heart and i have his

if you’re going to use the word ‘dream’ in a poem you had better be langston hughes

emotion is the poetry of life

poetry is nothing if it exists only in books one has to find it in ones own life

i ne’er was struck before that hour

with love so sudden and so sweet

her face it bloomed like a sweet flower

and stole my heart away complete

my face turned pale as deadly pale

my legs refused to walk away

and when she looked what could i ail

my life and all seemed turned to clay

and then my blood rushed to my face

and took my eyesight quite away

the trees and bushes round the place

i could not see a single thing

words from my eyes did start—

they spoke as chords do from the string

and blood burnt round my heart

are flowers the winter’s choice

is love’s bed always snow

she seemed to hear my silent voice

not loves appeals to know

i never saw so sweet a face

as that i stood before

my heart has left its dwellingplace

and can return no more

the crazy thing about poetry is how its simplicity makes it complicated

for my part i love to give myself up to the illusion of poetry a hero of fiction that never existed is just as valuable to me as a hero of history that existed a thousand years ago

glinting golden through the trees

through the moonpierced warp of night

swaying to the kissing breeze

swings the treasure goldengleaming

far and lofty yet they glimmer

blinded by their radiant shimmer

pushing forward just for these

always thinking soon to seize

and possess the goldenglistening

orbed and glittering and pendent

not one missing still transcendent

yielding to no mans desire

glowing with a saffron fire

splendid unassailed the golden

the poet must be more useful than any other member if his tribe

this evening i sat by an open window

and read till the light was gone and the book

was no more than a part of the darkness

i could easily have switched on a lamp

but i wanted to ride the day down into night

to sit alone and smooth the unreadable page

with the pale gray ghost of my hand

when you are gone there is nor bloom nor leaf

nor singing sea at night nor silver birds

and i can only stare and shape my grief

i cannot conjure loveliness to drown

the bitter woe that racks my cords apart

the weary pen that sets my sorrow down

feeds at my heart

there is no mercy in the shifting year

no beauty wraps me tenderly about

i turn to little words so you my dear

can spell them out

i am a student of life and dont want to miss any experience theres poetry in this sort of thing you knowor perhaps you dont know but its all the same

those hours given over to basking in the glow of an imagined

future of being carried away in streams of promise by a love or

a passion so strong that one felt altered forever and convinced

that even the smallest particle of the surrounding world was

charged with purpose of impossible grandeur ah yes and

one would look up into the trees and be thrilled by the wind

loosened river of pale gold foliage cascading down and by the

high melodious singing of countless birds those moments so

many and so long ago still come back but briefly like fireflies

in the perfumed heat of summer night

i wasn’t reading poetry because my aim was to work my way through english literature in prose a–z

but this was different

i read in murder in the cathedral by ts eliot this is one moment  but know that another  shall pierce you with a sudden painful joy

i started to cry

…the unfamiliar and beautiful play made things bearable that day and the things it made bearable were another failed family—the first one was not my fault but all adopted children blame themselves the second failure was definitely my fault

i was confused about sex and sexuality and upset about the straightforward practical problems of where to live what to eat and how to do my a levels

i had no one to help me but the ts eliot helped me

it isn’t a hiding place it is a finding place

the mimicry of passion is the most intolerable of all poses

brimming thats what it is i want to get to a place where my sentences enact brimming

i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love

i see what i want of love i see horses making the meadow dance fifty guitars sighing and a swarm of bees suckling the wild berries and i close my eyes until i see our shadow behind this dispossessed place

i see what i want of people their desire to long for anything their lateness in getting to work and their hurry to return to their folk and their need to say good morning

translated breath against breath warms my life

a thousand kisses give me i pray thee

love says it all without number

love knows no law

no matter the disappointment you simply cannot divorce your favorite team

hate flows from a broken spirit

moonlight and high wind

dark poplars toss insinuate the sea

…be awake to the life

that is loving you and

sing your prayer laugh your prayer

dance your prayer run

and weep and sweat your prayer

sleep your prayer eat your prayer

paint sculpt hammer and read your prayer

sweep dig rake drive and hoe your prayer

garden and farm and build and clean your prayer

wash iron vacuum sew embroider and pickle your prayer

compute touch bend and fold but never delete

or mutilate your prayer

learn and play your prayer

work and rest your prayer

fast and feast your prayer

argue talk whisper listen and shout your prayer

groan and moan and spit and sneeze your prayer

swim and hunt and cook your prayer

digest and become your prayer

release and recover your prayer

breathe your prayer

be your prayer

ill be writing as long as i can hold a pen in my curled crimped arthritic hands and then ill dictate it if it comes to that theyll have to pry my pen out of my cold dead fingers  and even then ill fight em for it guaranteed

who never lived and so can never die

how very near they seem yet how remote

that age before the world went all awry

but still the game’s afoot for those with ears

attuned to catch the distant viewhalloo

england is england yet for all our fears–

only those things the heart believes are true

a yellow fog swirls past the windowpane

as night descends upon this fabled street

a lonely hansom splashes through the rain

the ghostly gas lamps fail at twenty feet

here though the world explode these two survive

and it is always eighteen ninetyfive

i never heard sound and thrill of my painful heart until that very day she touched it

this poem has been called obscure i refuse to believe that it is obscurer than pity violence or suffering but being a poem not a lifetime it is more compressed

anyone who has no feelings for animals has a dead heart

i have seen it over and over the same sea the same

slightly indifferently swinging above the stones

icily free above the stones

above the stones and then the world

if you should dip your hand in

your wrist would ache immediately

your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn

as if the water were a transmutation of fire

that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame

if you tasted it it would first taste bitter

then briny then surely burn your tongue

it is like what we imagine knowledge to be

drawn form the cold hard mouth

of the world derived from the rocky breasts

forever flowing and drawn and since

our knowledge is historical flowing and flown

on no work of words

on no work of words now for three lean months in the bloody

belly of the rich year and the big purse of my body

i bitterly take to task my poverty and craft

to take to give is all return what is hungrily given

puffing the pounds of manna up through the dew to heaven

the lovely gift of the gab bangs back on a blind shaft

to lift to leave from the treasures of man is pleasing death

that will rake at last all currencies of the marked breath

and count the taken forsaken mysteries in a bad dark

to surrender now is to pay the expensive ogre twice

ancient woods of my blood dash down to the nut of the seas

if i take to burn or return this world which is each mans work

if you heard your lover scream in the next room

and you ran in and saw his pinkie on the floor in a small puddle of blood

you wouldnt rush to the pinkie and say

darling are you ok

no youd wrap your arms around his shoulders

and worry about the pinkie later

the same holds true if you heard the scream

ran in and saw his hand or god forbid his whole arm

but suppose you hear your lover scream in the next room

and you run in and his head is on the floor next to his body

which do you rush to and comfort first

we didn’t deny the obvious

but we didn’t entirely accept it either

i mean we said hello to it each morning

in the foyer we patted its little head

as it made a mess in the backyard

but we never nurtured it many nights the obvious showed up

at our bedroom door in its pajamas

unable to sleep in need of a hug

and we just stared at it like an armenian

or even worse— hid beneath the covers

and pretended not to hear its tiny sobs

come boy and pour for me a cup

of old falernian fill it up

with wine strong sparkling bright and clear

our host decrees no water here

let dullards drink the nymphs pale brew

the sluggish thin their blood with dew

for such pale stuff we have no use

for us the purple grapes rich juice

here burning bacchus rules tonight

i surrendered my identity in your eyes

now im just like everybody else and its so funny

the way monogamy is funny the way

someone falling down in the street is funny

i entered a revolving door and emerged

as a human being when you think of me

is my face electronically blurred

i remember your collarbone forming the tiniest

satellite dish in the universe your smile

as the place where parallel lines inevitably crossed

now dinosaurs freeze to death on your shoulder

i remember your eyes fifty attack dogs on a single leash

how i once held the soft audience of your hand

ive been ignored by prettier women than you

but none who carried the heavy pitchers of silence

so far without spilling a drop

only times and places only names and ghosts

a poem is a meteor

new york i say new york let black blood flow into your blood

let it wash the rust from your steel joints like an oil of life

let it give your bridges the curve of hips and supple vines

now the ancient age returns unity is restored

the recociliation of the lion and bull and tree

idea links to action the ear to the heart sign to meaning

see your rivers stirring with musk alligators

and sea cows with mirage eyes no need to invent the sirens

just open your eyes to the april rainbow

and your eyes especially your ears to god

who in one burst of saxophone laughter

created heaven and earth in six days

and on the seventh slept a deep negro sleep

no poet can know what his poem is going to be like until he has written it

you’re already naked in this world

in this time

in this life

beacause your next love

your next hunger

you next laughter

and even your next tear

poets like fighters both reap the benefits of roadwork

it rained all day on brest that day

and you walked smiling

in the rain

it rained all day on brest that day

and i ran into you in siam street

you were smiling

and i smiled too

you whom i didnt know

you who didnt know me

remember that day still

dont forget

a man was taking cover on a porch

and he cried your name

and you ran to him in the rain

and you threw yourself in his arms

remember that barbara

and dont be mad if i speak familiarly

i speak familiarly to everyone i love

even if ive seen them only once

i speak familiarly to all who are in love

even if i dont know them

dont forget

that good and happy rain

on your happy face

on that happy town

that rain upon the sea

upon the arsenal

upon the ushant boat

what shitstupidity the war

now whats become of you

under this iron rain

of fire and steel and blood

and he who held you in his arms

is he dead and gone or still so much alive

its rained all day on brest today

as it was raining before

but it isnt the same anymore

and everything is wrecked

its a rain of mourning terrible and desolate

nor is it still a storm

of iron and steel and blood

but simply clouds

dogs that disappear

in the downpour drowning brest

and float away to rot

a long way off

a long long way from brest

of which theres nothing left

the other lives i might have led

all now might as well be

dead survived by no one

barren without issue of any sort

this withered bud failed

in art and love with no time left

to change my course but time enough

when words lose their meaning physical force takes over

from an essay for writers by nancy crampton

i will go to campus alone dressed in antique silk slips and beatup cowboy boots and gypsy beads and i will study poetry i will sit on the edge of the fountain in the plaza and write

the element of craftsmanship in poetry is obscured by the fact that all men are taught to speak and most to read and write while very few men are taught to draw or paint or write music

we must experience certain things in life even in our childhood so we can later look back and value the journey

the collective wisdom of humanity is enshrined in its poetry

dear i cant write its all a fantasy a kind of circling obsession

from loves plectrum arises

the song of the string of life

love is the light of life

love is the fire of life

everyone should be forcibly transplanted to another continent from their family at the age of three

breathe in experience breathe out poetry

often turning her thoughts here

you like a goddess

and in your song most of all she rejoiced

but now she is conspicuous among lydian women

as sometimes at sunset

the rosyfingered moon

surpasses all the stars and her light

equally and flowerdeep fields

and the beautiful dew is poured out

and roses bloom and frail

chervil and flowering sweetclover

but she goes back and forth remembering

gentle atthis and in longing

she bites her tender mind

time again time like the soul wears many faces many bodies and climates and attitudes the past is one face the present a second and the future yet another

the moon people do not eat by swallowing food but by smelling it their money is poetry  actual poems written out on pieces of paper whose value is determined by the worth of the poem itself

and i choose to be alone

rather than wrapped in arms i could never need

saki says that youth is like hors doeuvres you are so busy thinking of the next courses you dont notice it when youve had them you wish youd had more hors doeuvres

there is bad in all good authors what a pity the converse isnt true

let them shoot us in the head

my blood will grow roots

and will blossom

it was as important to live poetically as to write poems

within my reflection i see tears for what i see is the truth are my greatest fears

a rainbow is inspiration provoking the poet uninvited the infatuation of the poet with the prose of the quran

which of your lords blessings do you disown

we are absent you and i we are present you and i

and absent

which of your lords blessings do you disown

…wisely mingled poetry and prose

sexual intercourse began in nineteen sixtythree which was rather late for me between the end of the chatterley ban and the beatles first lp

and dawn exalted like a host of doves  and then ive seen what men believe theyve seen

we remember though all the firelit glow

of a great hearths gleam and glare

and we looked for a space at each happy face

and the love that was written there

i am not obsessing

i am just sitting here

perforating this postit

with a pushpin

one writes a poem when one is so taken up by an emotional concept that one is unable to remain silent

unfools of unbeing  means quite clearly people who are too stereotyped to be eccentric – people who are too dead spiritually to exist at all and who call alive individual fools

i can speak of you now to anyone because i’ve stopped wanting anything like what i once wanted from you

i was compared to charles bukowski yesterday it was the best and worst compliment ive ever gotten

if we knew how to find

the lost we would know

how to rediscover

the parts of our minds

bad breath and butt smell that is prison in a nutshell

live for everything or die for nothing

the secret to life is to live as though you know the secret

where to start

everything cracks and shakes

the air trembles with similes

no one worlds better than another

the earth moans with metaphors

if only

you could have witnessed how

in a disused theatre and feel what

i have felt see how the world has

transformed me like the metamorphosis

if rape or arson poison or the knife

has wove no pleasing patterns in the stuff

of this drab canvas we accept as life

it is because we are not bold enough

august is dust here drought

stuns the road

but juice gathers in the berries

think neither fear nor courage saves us

unnatural vices are fathered by our heroism

virtues are forced upon us by our impudent crimes

these tears are shaken from the wrathbearing tree

dont patronize the chain bookstores every time i see some author scheduled to read and sign his books at a chain bookstore i feel like telling him hes stabbing the independent bookstores in the back

i am she who lifts the mountains

when she goes to hunt

who wears mamba for a headband

and a lion for a belt

and pick my teeth with rhinoceros horns

i drink up rivers to get at the hippos

let them hear my words

and her hunger is great

i am she who tosses trees

the ostrich is my pillow

and the elephant is my footstool

i am nhamo

who makes the river my highway

and sends crocodiles scurrying into the reeds

it is not what they built it is what they knocked down

it is not the houses it is the spaces between the houses

it is not the streets that exist it is the streets that no longer exist

where is my oasis too far from

here for me to crawl with these

dead legs refusing to cooperate

hands and fingers clawing uselessly

through the grains of sand

stuck in mid tropic strut it sometimes stands

as if considering how to cool avian plastic

dive into the mown lagoon of lawn

how take flight on dayglow flap

doodle wings no matter

if it is ballbald going nowhere fast

if words allow themselves to be handled it is with the help of infinite carefulness one has to welcome them listen to the before asking any service of them words are living things closely involved with human life

history is a hermaphrodite with many distinguished lovers we are neither mysteries nor strangers but the living breath of revelation made flesh by the unrestrained desires of a free and universal love universal me universal you

from past present and future are one

landscape is my religion

god in a green legend i lean over the pool

in a testament of leaves i dangle my twinkling mood

before me in a cool cave roofed with branches

and floored with a skin of water

how many fears came between us

earthquakes diseases wars where hell

from skies made of winged death

horror tore this world asunder

while inside the bleeding smoke

and beyond the shredded weeping flesh

we memorized tales of infinite good

from the history lesson

how are poets able to unzip what they see around them calling forth a truer essence from behind a common fact why reading a verse about a pear do you see past the fruit in so transcendent a way

we are spirits clad in veils

each and every words count

each and every thoughts count

consider the difference between the first and third person in poetry  its like the difference between looking at a person and looking through their eyes

four am work duty and i begin

my solitary trudge from outer compound

to main building a shivering guard

chilled in his lonely outpost strip searches

me until content that my inconsequential nudity

poses no threat and then whispers

the secret code that allows me admittance

into the open quartermile walkway

i chuff my way into another day

as ice glints on the razor wire

and the rifles note my numbed passage

silent but for my huffs and scuffle

on the cracked slippery sidewalk

and beringed in glory hangs over the prison

its gaudy glow taunting the halogen spotlights

the moon’s creamy pull upsets

some liquid equilibrium within me

and like tides wolves and all manner

of madmen i surrender disturbed by the certainty that under

the bony luminescence of a grinning moon

the lunar deliriums grip me

and i howlonce then again and

surely somewhere an unbound sleeper stirs

penitence is dying a giddy death

i shake myself sane

and as the echoes hang

in the frigid air i explain

to the wildeyed guard that convicts

like all animals under the leash

must bay at the beauty beyond them

ideas must work through the brains and arms of men or they are no better than dreams

the poet i saw once

but whose words have long been

in my mind windows of invincible candles

with slouch and swing around the ring

we trod the fools’ parade

we did not care we knew we were

the devils’ own brigade

and shaven head and feet of lead

and when i stand

in the receiving line

without the pillbox hat

if jackie were fat

and had taken enough klonopin

to still an ox

and you whisper

i think of you

dont finish with

because ive been going

to weight watchers

on tuesdays and wonder

if you want to go too

i am republic

i am maoist

i am activist

and i am this

and i am that

but why

why cant i be

to delight the ear and the eye is a mere sensual indulgence—true poetry strikes at the soul

the answer to our existence lies in existence itself

my art unkind my energy all gone blindthe limbs uneven the face shallowerbecause those who i see are not seenthose who see me are rude indeed so blow blow dear winter just blow along me

the purpose of poetry is to remind us  how difficult it is to remain just one person

freedom is the dream you dream

while putting thought in chains again

there is poetry as soon as we realize that we possess nothing

there’s no money in poetry but there’s no poetry in money either

flow gently ill sing thee

my marys asleep

by thy murmuring stream

disturb not her dream

resounds thro the glen

i charge you disturb not

my slumbering fair

how lofty sweet afton

far markd with the courses

there daily i wander

as noon rises high

my flocks and my marys

sweet cot in my eye

how pleasant thy banks

and green valleys below

where wild in the woodlands

the primroses blow

there oft as mild evening

weeps over the lea

the sweetscented birk shades

my mary and me

how lovely it glides

and winds by the cot where

my mary resides

how wanton thy waters

as gathering sweet flowerets

she stems thy clear wave

the theme of my lays

my marys asleep

by thy murmuring stream

disturb not her dreams

breath dreams silence invincible calm you triumph

poetry is an orphan of silence

i heard a bird congratulating itself

all day for being a jay

nobody cared but it was glad

all over again and said so again

for the beginning is assuredly

the end since we know nothing pure

and simple beyond

our own complexities

they mutilate they torment each other

with silences with words

as if they had another

life to live

they do so

as if they had forgotten

that their bodies

are inclined to death

that the insides of men

easily break down

ruthless with each other

they are weaker

than plants and animals

they can be killed by a word

by a smile by a look

i loved i was loved the sun stroked my face

life you owe me nothing life we are at peace

and so i pray i am today as honest

with myself with life all around me and below and above me

with all who i encounter

at the round earths imagined corners blow

your trumpets angels and arise arise

from death you numberless infinities

of souls and to your scattered bodies go

all whom the flood did and fire shall oerthrow

all whom war dearth age agues tyrannies

despair law chance hath slain and you whose eyes

shall behold god and never taste deaths woe

but let them sleep lord and me mourn a space

for if above all these my sins abound

tis late to ask abundance of thy grace

when we are there here on this lowly ground

teach me how to repent for thats as good

as if thou hadst seald my pardon with thy blood

this dream the world is having about itself

includes a trace on the plains of the oregon trail

a groove in the grass my father showed us all

one day while meadowlarks were trying to tell

something better about to happen

mute in that golden silence hung with green

come down from heaven and bring me in your eyes

remembrance of all beauty that has been

and stillness from the pools of paradise

when people say ive told you fifty times  they mean to scold and very often do  when poets say ive written fifty rhymes  they make you dread that they ii recite them too

in gangs of fifty thieves commit their crimes  at fifty love for love is rare t is true  but then no doubt it equally as true is  a good deal may be bought for fifty louis

we have to hold each other

round the waist to keep together

you ask me why im smiling

its because im thinking

i want it to rain forever

the poem has a social effect of some kind whether or not the poet wills it to have it has a kenetic force it sets in motionelements in the reader that would otherwise remain stagnant

everything has its poetry

the fear of poetry is an indication that we are cut off from our own reality

talent is a faucet when it is on one must write inspiration is a farce that poets have invented to give themselves importance

maybe when water yearned for fire  it invented waves  so one day they might become flames

bring to me it said continual proof  youve been alive

i said a line will take us hours maybe

yet if it does not seem a moments thought

our stitching and unstitching has been naught

this is why

he will never be given to wonder much

if he was the mouth for some cruel force

that said it but if he were

this will comfort her less than one moment

out of millions had he meant it

so many years and so many turns

they had swerved around the subject

and he will swear for many more

the kitchen and everything in it vanished

the oak table their guests the refrigerator door

he had been surely propped against

all changed to rusted ironwork and ash

except in the center in her linen caftan

she was not touched

he remembers the silence before he spoke

and her nodding a little

as if in the meat of this gray waste

here was the signal

for him to speak what they had long agreed

what somewhere they had prepared together

and this one moment in the desert of ash

stretches into forever

they had been having a dinner party

she had been lonely

a friend asked her almost joking

if she had ever felt really crazy

and when she started to unwind her answer

in long lovely sentences like scarves within her

he saw this was the way

they could no longer talk together

and that is when he said it

in front of the guests

because he couldnt bear to hear her

and this is why the guests have left

and she screams as he comes near her

many have referred to lewis carrolls rhymes as nonsense but in my childhood world — los angeles in the s — they made perfect sense

it is ferocious life but it must eat

it isnt that were alone or not alone

whose voice do you want mine yours

authors prayer

if i speak for the dead i must

leave this animal of my body

i must write the same poem over and over

for the empty page is a white flag of their surrender

if i speak of them i must walk

on the edge of myself i must live as a blind man

who runs through the rooms without

touching the furniture

yes i live i can cross the streets asking what year

is it

i can dance in my sleep and laugh

in front of the mirror

even sleep is a prayer lord

i will praise your madness and

in a language not mine speak

of music that wakes us music

in which we move for whatever i say

is a kind of petition and the darkest days

each arrow you shoot off

carries its own target

into the decidedly

dying speech of an old philosopher

i strove with none for none was worth my strife

nature i loved and next to nature art

i warmd both hands before the fire of life

it sinks and i am ready to depart

rush of pine scent once upon a time

the unlicensed conviction

there ought to be another way

this

yes he is here in this

the few young trees set out

to modify the bare facts

hes here but only

because we are here

when we go he goes with us

to be your hands that never

do violence your eyes

that wonder your lives

that daily praise life

by living it by laughter

he is never alone here

never cold in the field of graves

i suppose im saying that defiance is actually part of the lyric job

… the fisherman’s daughter grinding serenity in her coffee grinder

how can the confessor teach those who are lost and sick at heart when he himself among the sinners is worst and most forsaken it is only a game we play with other peoples sins besides everyone knows that everyone lies confessing

what if the mightiest word is love love beyond marital filial national love that casts a widening pool of light love with no need to preempt grievance

in todays sharp sparkle this winter air anything can be made any sentence begun

on the brink on the brim on the cusp  praise song for walking forward in that light

i have had my ups and downs

but wotthehell wotthehell

yesterday sceptres and crowns

fried oysters and velvet gowns

and today i herd with bums

but wotthehell wotthehell

i wake the world from sleep

as i caper and sing and leap

when i sing my wild free tune

under the blear eyed moon

i am pelted with cast off shoon

but wotthehell wotthehell

deep feeling doesnt make for good poetry a way with language would be a bit of help

i am talking about the responsibility of the poet who is irresponsible by definition an anarchist enamored of a solar order and never of the new order or whatever slogan makes five or six hundred million men march in step in a parody of order

there will never be an end

to this droning of the surf

we never said farewell

we never said farewell nor even looked

our last upon each other for no sign

was made when we the linkèd chain unhooked

and broke the level line

and here we dwell together side by side

our places fixed for life upon the chart

two islands that the roaring seas divide

are not more far apart

see how the roof glitters like ice

over there a slice of yellow cuts into the silverblue and beside it stand two geraniums purple because the light is silverblue tonight

poetry is the sound of the human animal

like poetry in times of intense emotion the image returns to me like poetry it stroked my soul and by turns lulled and stoked my senses

all that we call sacred history attests that the birth of a poet is the principal event in chronology

settle back with muffins and tea

until the window empties

now is history as fast as the mind remembers

if the incision of our words amounts to nothing but a feeling a slow motion it will still cut a better swath than the factory model the corporate model the penitentiary model which by my lights are one and the same

i placed a jar in tennessee and round it

was upon a hill

when we leave this world we give up all our possessions and our memories love is the only thing we take with us it is all we carry from one life to the next

i believe that to be the worlds greatest living

there must be something

terribly wrong with you

i dont even want to be the worlds greatest

just being dead would be fair

true beauty is measured by the number of pearls within you not those around your neck

the day breaks not it is my heart

and he

history is what it is it knows what it did

mathematics and poetry are the two ways to drink the beauty of truth

tell me it was for the hunger

nothing less for hunger is to give

the body what it knows

it cannot keep that this amber light

whittled down by another war

is all that pins my hand to your chest

give it air  let the scar on your soul reveal itself because like the body it too was made to heal itself

it’s your privilege to find me incomprehensible i gave you my minutes let them remain ours i hope i haunt you

i dont want perfect i want something real something that makes me feel

remember me when i am dead

and simplify me when im dead

your poetryit doesnt deserve to be locked away hidden from the rest of the world and neither do you

some plant lips on mother earth in a display of gratitude

meanwhile she is kissing the soles of your feet recognizing the one to be worshiped is you

the forest rose like a dream

from the mind of chaos’s lonely daughter

and the sun fell heavy and thick

to warm the blood of a world

not quite ready to live

but so tired of its own imagination

call it deep while all is well be

cause my life seems like a freestyle mean

while asleep on the couch i dream its a written piece and now

the symphonys sounding

shouting out to these feet whose leaps feel foul but quite loud

but how

im allowed to live my dreams

my chimeran team brings the siberian breed

riding reality free til these tires they freeze

in mires in dire need of wires fire and heat but

i love a dark hard cold heart in the wintery breeze

then you are a poet she asked fingering the flyer in her pocket

no not at all he waved his hand i am merely a character in a poem

we are all of life

who stepped from the sea

trading weightless journeys of the currents

we are all of life

who build and tear down and build again

to find gold and silver

to find scars that weep and bleed

to step from the sea

to stay with the sea

i have been living alone for the last four years i am familiar with my loneliness and sometimes i feel like a soldier who can survive without love or poetry too i am used to leading this hard life

yours sincerely

wings greater than wings

wings greater than walls

i feed my heart with sighs thats all it asks

i live on tears i think im born to weep

i dont complain of that since in my state

weeping is sweeter than you might believe

where are you now i was there whilst you cried

i was there to comfort you with smile

i was there to give you a hand

when all faith was lost

i was there to open doors of opportunities

i was there to share my passion for life

i was there to feed you

when you were hungry

i was there to listen to your turmoil

i was there to lift your spirit

when you were broken

i was there when you were ill and alone

i was there when you were betrayed

lied to and ridiculed

i was there to understand

to care and to share

i was there …

to play to sing to dance

to write to love to create and innovate

i was there …

where are you now …

by natasha parker

the dark side of the butterflies

another secret of the shadows

the heart of the universe

its a summer afternoon

summers afternoon

summers afternoon

summers afternoon

you can feel the dark side

of the butterflies

you can feel

my most beautiful face

summers afternoon

summers afternoon

summers afternoon

in the middle

of our bloodiest battles

you lay down your arms

to conqueror me home

the storms inside uncoil

into sky held calm by far seeing eyes

memories dressed in the translucent

trickery of the mind

so as to wear life upon themselves

give up their tired dance and run

into free frequency

being a writer makes you immortal

moonlight disappears down the hills

mountains vanish into fog

and i vanish into poetry

stronger than mountains

a place where my heart

feels the safest

underneath his shirt

i care for you darling i love you

the only reason i fucked l is because you fucked

z and then i fucked r and you fucked n

and because you fucked n i had to fuck

y but i think of you constantly i feel you

here in my belly like a baby love id call it

no matter what happens id call it love and so

you fucked c and then before i could move

you fucked w so i had to fuck d but

i want you to know that i love you i think of you

constantly i dont think ive ever loved anybody

like i love you

i breathe in

the fragrance

of love and moist sand

the one

his roses left

on both my hands

i just keep on breathing

as much as i can

preserving it in my body

for the day

it can’t

there is some aching

that will only heal

in the mosque of sleep

tell mehow do you stand there

filling the doorwayof my life

myself

in you

i immerse myself

into a

i want to

stay curled and cosied

and chocolatedforever

in my mother’s arms

live as many lives as you can

your eyes that once were never weary of mine

are bowed in sorrow under pendulous lids

because our love is waning

and then she

although our love is waning let us stand

by the lone border of the lake once more

together in that hour of gentleness

when the poor tired child passion falls asleep

how far away the stars seem and how far

is our first kiss and ah how old my heart

pensive they paced along the faded leaves

while slowly he whose hand held hers replied

passion has often worn our wandering hearts

the woods were round them and the yellow leaves

fell like faint meteors in the gloom and once

a rabbit old and lame limped down the path

autumn was over him and now they stood

on the lone border of the lake once more

turning he saw that she had thrust dead leaves

gathered in silence dewy as her eyes

in bosom and hair

ah do not mourn he said

that we are tired for other loves await us

hate on and love through unrepining hours

before us lies eternity our souls

are love and a continual farewell

i sought among the drifting leaves

the golden leaves that once were green

to see if love were hiding there

and peeping out between

for thro the silver showers of may

and thro the summers heavy heat

in vain i sought his golden head

and light fastflying feet

perhaps when all the world is bare

and cruel winter holds the land

the love that finds no place to hide

will run and catch my hand

i shall not care to have him then

i shall be bitter and acold

it grows too late for frolicking

when all the world is old

then little hiding love come forth

come forth before the autumn goes

and let us seek thro ruined paths

the gardens last red rose

happy the man whose wish and care

a few paternal acres bound

content to breathe his native air

in his own ground

whose herds with milk whose fields with bread

whose flocks supply him with attire

whose trees in summer yield him shade

blest who can unconcern’dly find

hours days and years slide soft away

quiet by day

sound sleep by night study and ease

together mix’d sweet recreation

and innocence which most does please

with meditation

steal from the world and not a stone

tell where i lie

to be the other woman

is to be a season

that is always about to end

when the air is flowered

with jasmine and peach

and the weather day after day

and the forecast

art is long and time is fleeting

and our hearts though stout and brave

still like muffled drums are beating

funeral marches to the grave

invitation to eternity

say wilt thou go with me sweet maid

say maiden wilt thou go with me

through the valleydepths of shade

of bright and dark obscurity

where the path has lost its way

where the sun forgets the day

where theres nor light nor life to see

sweet maiden wilt thou go with me

where stones will turn to flooding streams

where plains will rise like oceans waves

where life will fade like visioned dreams

and darkness darken into caves

say maiden wilt thou go with me

through this sad nonidentity

where parents live and are forgot

and sisters live and know us not

say maiden wilt thou go with me

in this strange death of life to be

to live in death and be the same

without this life or home or name

at once to be and not to be—

that was and is not—yet to see

things pass like shadows and the sky

above below around us lie

the land of shadows wilt thou trace

nor look nor know each others face

the present marred with reason gone

and past and present both as one

say maiden can thy life be led

to join the living and the dead

then trace thy footsteps on with me

we are wed to one eternity

matched with an aged wife i mete and dole

that hoard and sleep and feed and know not me

ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december

and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor

eagerly i wished the morrow — vainly i had sought to borrow

from my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the lost lenore

the waves is an extraordinary achievement  it is trembling on the edge a little less  and it would lose its poetry a little more  and it would be over into the abyss and be dull and arty it is her greatest book

i put a chameleon on a red dildo he blushed

chains that hold me to the ground

chains that keep me solidly bound

chains that tether my heart to you

chains that only one truth

up the airy mountain

down the rushy glen

we darent go ahunting

i’m happy but some beauty is nonesuch

the gently sloping path across the wood

the wretched bridge that’s just a little skewed

and that for which i won’t be waiting much

following dark winters strife a warm air rises teemed with life birth rebirth as the waiting die old love new love sprouts wings to fly

hill tops like hot iron glitter bright in the sun

and the rivers were eying burn to gold as they run

burning hot is the ground liquid gold is the air

whoever looks round sees eternity there

the new grass rising in the hills

the cows loitering in the morning chill

a dozen or more old browns hidden

in the shadows of the cottonwoods

beside the streambed i go higher

to where the road gives up and there’s

only a faint path strewn with lupine

between the mountain oaks i don’t

ask myself what i’m looking for

i didn’t come for answers

to a place like this i came to walk

on the earth still cold still silent

still ungiving i’ve said to myself

although it greets me with last year’s

dead thistles and this year’s

wild onions the curling remains

of spider’s cloth what did i bring

to the dance in my back pocket

a crushed letter from a woman

i’ve never met bearing bad news

i can do nothing about so i wander

these woods half sightless while

a west wind picks up in the trees

clustered above the pines make

a music like no other rising and

falling like a distant surf at night

that calms the darkness before

first light soughing we call it from

old english no less how weightless

words are when nothing will do

in crime and enmity they lie

who sin and tell us love can die

who say to us in slanders breath

that love belongs to sin and death

pretending to drown

the only regret is that i waited

longer than a breath

to scatter the suns reflection

with my body

new stars burst upon the water

when you pulled me in

on the shore our clothes

begged us to be good boys again

every stick our feet touched

i sank into the depths to see you

as the lake saw you cut in half

by the surface taut legs kicking

the rest of you sky

of what you knew i wanted

to see

when i resurfaced slick grin

knowing glance you pushed me

i pretended to drown

then swallowed you whole

thats just a little bit about me

a tired man lay down his head

in a dusty room so dim

and for so long his wife did shake

and yell to waken him

meanwhile his thoughts his dreams did stir

of powderblasts in the air

and carnival delights

yet still his wife was in despair

in a dusty room so dim

for she knew death was a whore

not far from tempting him

the gods play no

some women marry houses

a hard life with memory

i’m a poor audience for my memory

she wants me to attend her voice nonstop

but i fidget fuss

listen and don’t

step out come back then leave again

she wants all my time and attention

she’s got no problem when i sleep

the day’s a different matter which upsets her

she thrusts old letters snapshots at me eagerly

stirs up events both important and un

turns my eyes to overlooked views

peoples them with my dead

in her stories i’m always younger

which is nice but why always the same story

every mirror holds different news for me

she gets angry when i shrug my shoulders

and takes revenge by hauling out old errors

weighty but easily forgotten

looks into my eyes checks my reaction

then comforts me it could be worse

she wants me to live only for her and with her

but my plans still feature today’s sun

at times i get fed up with her

i suggest a separation from now to eternity

then she smiles at me with pity

since she knows it would be the end of me too

you will find poetry nowhere unless you bring some of it with you

spring and fall to a young child

márgarét are you gríeving

leáves líke the things of man you

with your fresh thoughts care for can you

ah ás the heart grows older

it will come to such sights colder

by and by nor spare a sigh

and yet you wíll weep and know why

now no matter child the name

sórrows spríngs áre the same

nor mouth had no nor mind expressed

what heart heard of ghost guessed

it ís the blight man was born for

it is margaret you mourn for

a savage place as holy and enchanted

as eer beneath a waning moon was haunted

by woman wailing for her demonlover

in search of truth the hopeful zealot goes

but all the sadder tums the more he knows

each moment a white bull steps shining into the world

if the gods bring to you

a strange and frightening creature

accept the gift

as if it were one you had chosen

say the accustomed prayers

oil the hooves well

caress the small ears with praise

have the new halter of woven silver

embedded with jewels

spare no expense pay what is asked

when a gift arrives from the sea

treat it as you yourself

would be treated brought speechless and naked

into the court of a king

and when the request finally comes

do not hesitate even an instant

stroke the white throat

the heavy trembling dewlaps

youd come to believe were yours

and plunge in the knife

not once

did you enter the pasture

without yourself trembling

that you came to love it that was the gift

let the envious gods take back what they can

outside our small safe place flies mystery

where joy in an old pencil is not absurd

and yet this self contains

is small and solitary as one grassblade

passed over by the wind

amongst a myriad grasses on the prairie

now therefore while the youthful hue

and while thy willing soul transpires

at every pore with instant fires

now let us sport us while we may

and now like amorous birds of prey

rather at once our time devour

than languish in his slowchapt power

the laws of god the laws of man

the laws of god the laws of man

he may keep that will and can

not i let god and man decree

laws for themselves and not for me

and if my ways are not as theirs

let them mind their own affairs

their deeds i judge and much condemn

yet when did i make laws for them

please yourselves say i and they

need only look the other way

but no they will not they must still

wrest their neighbor to their will

and make me dance as they desire

with jail and gallows and hellfire

and how am i to face the odds

of mans bedevilment and gods

i a stranger and afraid

in a world i never made

they will be master right or wrong

though both are foolish both are strong

and since my soul we cannot fly

to saturn nor to mercury

keep we must if keep we can

these foreign laws of god and man

every time your work is read you die several deaths for every word and poetry is like being flayed alive

still must the poet as of old

in barren attic bleak and cold

starve freeze and fashion verses to

such things as flowers and song and you

still as of old his being give

in beautys name while she may live

beauty that may not die as long

as there are flowers and you and song

poetry had always seemed something i could turn to in need  an emergency exit a lifebuoy as well as a justification

man is no star but a quick coal

who blows it not nor doth control

as when o lady mine

with chiselled touch

the stone unhewn and cold

the more the marble wastes

the more the statue grows

where were you then

who else was there

saying what

why will the whole of love come on me suddenly when i am sad and feel you are far away

the computer is incredibly fast accurate and stupid

man is unbelievably slow inaccurate and brilliant

the marriage of the two is a force beyond calculation

an orphans curse would drag to hell

a spirit from on high

but oh more horrible than that

is the curse in a dead mans eye

seven days seven nights i saw that curse

and yet i could not die

the long hill

i must have passed the crest a while ago

and now i am going down

strange to have crossed the crest and not to know

but the brambles were always grabbing at the hem of my gown

all the morning i thought how proud i should be

to stand there straight as a queen

wrapped in the wind and the sun with the world under me

but the air was dull there was little i could have seen

it was nearly level along the beaten track

and the brambles caught in my gown

but its no use now to think of turning back

the rest of the way will be only going down

out of the noise of tired people working

harried with thoughts of war and lists of dead

his beauty met me like a fresh wind blowing

clean boyish beauty and highheld head

eyes that told secrets lips that would not tell them

fearless and shy the young unwearied eyes

men die by millions now because god blunders

yet to have made this boy he must be wise

that dont even exist

a fool lies here who tried to hustle the east

here they have no time for the fine graces

of poetry unless it freely grows

in deep compulsion like water in the well

woven into the texture of the soil

ye who have laid your love to rest

and wept above their lifeless clay

know not the anguish of that breast

whose lovd are rudely torn away

ye may not know how desolate

are bosoms rudely forced to part

and how a dull and heavy weight

will press the lifedrops from the heart

y escucharte

to have without holding

learning to love differently is hard

love with the hands wide open love

with the doors banging on their hinges

the cupboard unlocked the wind

roaring and whimpering in the rooms

rustling the sheets and snapping the blinds

that thwack like rubber bands

in an open palm

it hurts to love wide open

stretching the muscles that feel

as if they are made of wet plaster

then of blunt knives then

it hurts to thwart the reflexes

of grab of clutch to love and let

go again and again it pesters to remember

the lover who is not in the bed

to hold back what is owed to the work

that gutters like a candle in a cave

without air to love consciously

i cant do it you say its killing

me but you thrive you glow

on the street like a neon raspberry

you float and sail a helium balloon

bright bachelors buttons blue and bobbing

on the cold and hot winds of our breath

as we make and unmake in passionate

diastole and systole the rhythm

of our unbound bonding to have

and not to hold to love

with minimized malice hunger

and anger moment by moment balanced

after the final no there comes a yes  and on that yes the future world depends

the skies bend the time stops the lanes move and the fires dance

it can mean only one thing that i am with you

you are enigmatic yet so beautiful that i have lost my sense

you are as immaculate as the unadulterated morning dew

and your beauty leaves me in a mystified trance

i do not foresee what you and i will be

but i promise to be with you till the rocks keep meeting the sea

by charlotte m liebelfawls

youre a cavity in my oasis

youre a porthole in my sea

youre a stretch of the imagination

every time you look at me

youre an ocean in my wineglass

youre a steinway on the beach

youre a captivating audience

an exciting rembrandt

you ask me why i dont speak

not a word at will

but write so much worth well over a mill

a sober one a closer one penetrates the heart

darling its how it mends it

for if in careless summer days

in groves of ashtaroth we whored

repentant now when winds blow cold

we kneel before our rightful lord

the lord of all the moneygod

who rules us blood and hand and brain

who gives the roof that stops the wind

and giving takes away again

who spies with jealous watchful care

our thoughts our dreams our secret ways

who picks our words and cuts our clothes

and maps the pattern of our days

who chills our anger curbs our hope

and buys our lives and pays with toys

who claims as tribute broken faith

who binds with chains the poet’s wit

the navvy’s strength the soldier’s pride

and lays the sleek estranging shield

between the lover and his bride

why there isnt any drama in my life

so ill crawl on the cottonfield with a fife

why to have a dream in vain my life begs

am a house gecko i eat flies and lay eggs

my death surely doesnt yield a headline and all

ill break law by pissing on a castles wall

for my death there wouldnt be a weeping meni

from the name of lady canning theres ledikeni

one foot on heaven and one foot on hell hanging

one cannon and two cannonballs dangling

from the shadow of domes in the city of domes

a snowflake a blizzard of one weightless entered your room

and made its way to the arm of the chair where you looking up

from your book saw it the moment it landed thats all

there was to it

the touch of

your fingers

delicate as

rolling it round

i savor it on my tongue

try to

make it last

the words

you

in the air

and melt

your palm

against

my cheek

light as

so what if the air

my shirt smells of you

stani walks in later glaring at them both

bloody bastards one minute punching each other next minute reading poetry what’s wrong with everyone this week

tom can tell that

i live my life in growing orbits which move out over the things of the world

learning to be a lady  is like learning  to live within a shell  to be a crustacean encased  in a small white  uncomfortable world

always learn poems by heart she said they have to become the marrow in your bones like fluoride in the water theyll make your soul impervious to the worlds soft decay

i want to tie one thousand balloons around my neck

and float up

while slowly dying of happiness

the glory of the protagonist is always paid for

by a lot of secondary characters

entering a cell penetrating deep as a flying saucer to find a new galaxy would be an honorable task for a new scientist interested more in the inner state of the soul than in outer space

the surge of his ardour swept through him in climatic release filling her womb with his final mortal sowing

what seems real one moment is fiction the next

and gone out of existence the moment after that

nostalgia is the greatest enemy of truth

and change our only constancy

i sing the song of my heartstrings alone in the eternal muteness in the face of god

i would like the discovery of poetry to be a field guide to the natural pleasures of language  a happiness we were born to have

in a slapfight with jesus

my face bleeds

because no one cut their fingernails back then

the poet dreams of the mountain

sometimes i grow weary of the days with all their fits and starts

i want to climb some old gray mountains slowly taking

the rest of my lifetime to do it resting often sleeping

under the pines or above them on the unclothed rocks

i want to see how many stars are still in the sky

that we have smothered for years now a century at least

i want to look back at everything forgiving it all

and peaceful knowing the last thing there is to know

all that urgency not what the earth is about

how silent the trees their poetry being of themselves only

i want to take slow steps and think appropriate thoughts

in ten thousand years maybe a piece of the mountain will fall

the sweetness of dogs fifteen

what do you say percy i am thinking

of sitting out on the sand to watch

the moon rise full tonight

so we go

and the moon rises so beautiful it

makes me shudder makes me think about

time and space makes me take

measure of myself one iota

i thinking how grateful i am for the moon’s

perfect beauty and also oh how rich

it is to love the world percy meanwhile

leans against me and gazes up into

my face as though i were

his perfect moon

on the beach at dawn

hugging each other

how many kinds of love

might there be in the world

and how many formations might they make

and who am i ever

to imagine i could know

such a marvelous business

when the sun broke

it poured willingly its light

over the stones

that did not move not at all

just as to its always generous term

it shed its light on me

my own body that loves

equally to hug another body

music resembles poetry in each

are nameless graces which no methods teach

and which a master hand alone can reach

percy wakes me and i am not ready

he has slept all night under the covers

now he’s eager for action a walk then breakfast

so i hasten up he is sitting on the kitchen counter

where he is not supposed to be

how wonderful you are i say how clever if you

to wake me

he thought he would a lecture and deeply

his eyes begin to shine

he tumbles onto the couch for more compliments

he squirms and squeals he has done something

that he needed

and now he hears that it is okay

i scratch his ears i turn him over

and touch him everywhere he is

wild with the okayness of it then we walk then

he has breakfast and he is happy

this is a poem about percy

this is a poem about more than percy

think about it

in your hands

the dog the donkey surely they know

they are alive

who would argue otherwise

but now after years of consideration

i am getting beyond that

what about the sunflowers what about

the tulips and the pines

listen all you have to do is start and

there’ll be no stopping

what about mountains what about water

and speaking of stones what about

the little ones you can

hold in your hands their heartbeats

so secret so hidden it may take years

before finally you hear them

call me but love and ill be new baptized

henceforth i never will be romeo

how heron comes

it is a negligence of the mind

not to notice how at dusk

heron comes to the pond and

stands there in his death robes perfect

servant of the system hungry his eyes

full of attention his wings

i think that at a certain age say fifteen or sixteen poetry is like masturbation but later in life good poets burn their early poetry and bad poets publish it thankfully i gave up rather quickly

through the darkest hours of the night

and through the dreamers realm i seek

far beyond the starry sky

and beyond galaxies i am free

through the grimmest memories

and past a seasons air i cannot breathe

far beyond this mortal world

in an afterlife we shall meet

poetry is the art of uniting pleasure with truth

critics write out of intellectual exercise not poets poets write straight from the heart

will be but corpses dressed in frocks

who cannot speak to birds or rocks

fiction and poetry are medicines theyre doses and they heal the rupture that reality makes on the imagination

tom dancer’s gift of a whitebark pine cone

you never know

what opportunity

is going to travel to you

or through you

once a friend gave me

one of a few

he found in the scat

or wyoming

i took it home

and did what i supposed

he was sure i would do

i ate it

how it had traveled

through that rough

and holy body

it was crisp and sweet

it was almost a prayer

my gratitude tom dancer

for this gift of the world

i adore so much

and want to belong to

and thank you too great bear

i love being able to see an unwritten future

ghost beats zombie zombie beats most

troll beats goblin goblin eats a hermit’s soul

town fights jackals town will win

town fights mummies town won’t fight again

client beats frog frog beats himself

the dark kills spiderfish spiderfish beats shark

you beat me i beat a dentist

the dentist beats the barber the barber is menaced

these are the rules and never forget

now hand over your money and place your bet

it came to me on a winter day

life so full and rich will fade

though i wish it were not so

one cannot run from an expected fate

and as a steady gust of wind fell upon my face

it was then when i felt a chill and thus did then know

though i wish it were not true

life beautiful and sweet shall ripe and pass today

as a petal falls from a rose so shall she blossom and shed

catching each falling tear i will not leave a word unsaid

he loves me he loves me not how many flowers must i kill before he loves me he loves me he loves me not

success is counted sweetest by those neer succeed

love is as we will it to be  amunhotep el bey

no one could say the stories were useless

for as the tongue clacked

five or forty fingers stitched

corn was grated from the husk

or the darning was done

from the storyteller poems

tell me enigmatical man whom do you love best your father

your mother your sister or your brother

i have neither father nor mother nor sister nor brother

your friends

now you use a word whose meaning i have never known

your country

i do not know in what latitude it lies

i could indeed love her goddess and immortal

i hate it as you hate god

then what do you love extraordinary stranger

i love the clouds the clouds that pass up there

up there the wonderful clouds

…how it would be nice if for every sea waiting for us there would be a river for us

a way from here to the sea

we live in a modern society husbands and wives dont

grow on trees like in the old days so where

does one find love when youre sixteen its easy

like being unleashed with a credit card

in a department store of kisses theres the first kiss

the sloppy kiss the peck

the sympathy kiss the backseat smooch the we

shouldnt be doing this kiss the but your lips

taste so good kiss the bury me in an avalanche of tingles kiss

the i wish youd quit smoking kiss

the i accept your apology but you make me really mad

sometimes kiss the i know

your tongue like the back of my hand kiss as you get

older kisses become scarce youll be driving

home and see a damaged kiss on the side of the road

with its purple thumb out if you

were younger youd pull over slide open the mouths

red door just to see how it fits oh where

does one find love if you rub two glances you get a smile

rub two smiles you get a warm feeling

rub two warm feelings and prestoyou have a kiss

now what dont invite the kiss over

and answer the door in your underwear itll get suspicious

and stare at your toes dont water the kiss with whiskey

itll turn bright pink and explode into a thousand luscious splinters

but in the morning itll be ashamed and sneak out of

your body without saying goodbye

and youll remember that kiss forever by all the little cuts it left

on the inside of your mouth you must

nurture the kiss turn out the lights notice how it

illuminates the room hold it to your chest

and wonder if the sand inside hourglasses comes from a

special beach place it on the tongues pillow

then look up the first recorded kiss in an encyclopedia beneath

but one kiss levitates above all the others the

intersection of function and desire the i do kiss

the ill love you through a brick wall kiss

even when im dead ill swim through the earth

like a mermaid of the soil just to be next to your bones

the soil under the grass is dreaming of a young forest and under the pavement the soil is dreaming of grass

only god can mend a broken heart

once i dated a woman i only liked

so i only listened to  of what she said

only told the truth  of the time

and only kissed with  of my lips

some say you cant quantify desire

attaching a number to passion isnt right

that the human heart doesnt work like that

but for me it doesi walk down the street

and numbers appear on the foreheads

of the people i look at in bars its worse

with each drink the numbers go up

until every woman in the joint has a blurry

eighty something above her eyebrows

and the next day i can only remember

of what actually happened thats the problem

with boozeit screws with your math

the trifler

deaths the lover that id be taking

wild and fickle and fierce is he

smalls his care if my heart be breaking

gay young death would have none of me

hear them clack of my haste to greet him

no one other my mouth had kissed

i had dressed me in silk to meet him

false young death would not hold the tryst

slows the blood that was quick and stormy

smooth and cold is the bridal bed

i must wait till he whistles for me

proud young death would not turn his head

i must wait till my breast is wilted

i must wait till my back is bowed

i must rock in the corner jilted

death went galloping down the road

gones my heart with a trifling rover

fine he was in the game he played

kissed and promised and threw me over

and rode away with a prettier maid

this is freedom this is the face of faith nobody gets

what they want never again are you the same the longing

is to be pure what you get is to be changed more and more by

each glistening minute through which infinity threads itself

also oblivion of course the aftershocks of something

at sea here hands full of sand letting it

sift through

in the wind i look in and say take this hurry and if i listen

now listen i was not saying anything it was only

something i did i could not chose words i am free to go

i cannot of course come back not to this never

it is a ghost posed on my lips here never

words are power the more words you know and can recognize use define understand the more power you will have as a human being the more language you know the more likely it is that no one can get over on you

selection from book our difficult sunlight a guide to poetry literacy  social justice in classroom  community

mathematicians still don’t understand

the ball our hands made or how

your electrocuted grandparents made it possible

for you to light my cigarettes with your eyes

it isn’t as simple as me climbing into the window

to leave six ounces of orange juice

and a doughnut by the bed or me becoming

the sand you dug your toes in

on the beach when you wished

to hide them from the sun and the fixed eyes

of strangers and your breath broke in waves

over my earlobe splashing through my head spilling out

over the opposite lobe and my first poems

under your door in the unshaven light of dawn

your eyes remind me of a brick wall

about to be hammered by a drunk

driver i’m that driver all night

i’ve swallowed you in the bar

once i kissed the scar stretching its sealed

eyelid along your inner arm dried

all your idiosyncratic passageways so i’d know

where to run when the cops came

your body is the country i’ll never return to

the man in charge of what crosses my mind

will lose fingernails for not turning you

away at the border but at this moment

when sweat tingles from me and

blame is as meaningless as shooting up a cow with milk

i realise my kisses filled the halls of your body

with smoke and the lies came

like a season most drunks don’t die in accidents

they orchestrate and i swallowed

a hand grenade that never stops exploding

the everlasting staircase

when the call came saying twentyfour hours to live

my first thought was cant she postpone her exit

from this planet for a week ive got places to do

people to be then grief hit between the ribs

said disappear or reappear more fully so i boarded

a red eyeball and shot across america

hoping the nurses had enough quarters to keep

the jukebox of grandmas heart playing she grew up

poor in appalachia and while world war ii

functioned like prozac for the great depression

she believed poverty was a double feature

that the comfort of her adult years was merely

an intermission that hunger would hobble back

hurl its prosthetic leg through her window

so she clipped clipped clipped  became the jacques

cousteau of the bargain bin her wetsuit

stuffed with coupons and now pupils fixed chin

dangling like the boots of a hanged man

i press my ear to her lampshadethin chest

and listen to that little soldier march toward whatever

plateau or simply exhaust his arsenal of beats

i hate when people ask if she even knew i was there

the point is i knew holding the onesided

conversation of her hand once i believed the heart

was like a bar of soap  the more you use it

the smaller it gets care too much and itll snap off

in your grasp but when grandmas last breath

waltzed from that room my heart opened

wide like a parachute and i realized she didnt die

she simply found a silence she could call her own

lifes like a painters palette just when youve got everything worked out the colours change

if you are the lantern i am the flame

if you are the lake then i am the rain

if you are the desert i am the sea

if you are the blossom i am the bee

if you are the fruit then i am the core

if you are the rock then i am the ore

if you are the ballad i am the word

if you are the sheath then i am the sword

i learned a long long time ago that i could accomplish things in this place we call reality and yet still spend most of my time in the better reality of my mind

faith is the poetry of our dreams action is the builder of our reality

we all must face death and walk with it but we also must love and live in it

women who have been disappeared by violence are howling the voices of disappeared women are echoing i sing with these voices

i believe the visionaries and true reflections of society will be rewarded after their lives those being rewarded now are giving the public what it needs now usually applauding its current state and clearing consciences

more sailors have drowned in words than in the sea

say what you mean and mean what you say

when i shut my eyes on this world ill finally have peace

i bargained with life for a penny

and life would pay no more

when i counted my scanty store

for life is just an employer

he gives you what you ask

but once you have set the wages

why you must bear the task

i worked for a menials hire

only to learn dismayed

that any wage i had asked of life

such a small pure object a poem could be made of nothing but air a tiny string of letters maybe small enough to fit in the palm of your hand but it could blow everybodys head off

if i knew what to do

id do more than write a song for you

music straightjackets a poem and prevents it from breathing on its own whereas it liberates a lyric poetry doesnt need music lyrics do

dying is a universe of its own

it was a scary thought a man could be surrounded by poetry reading and not know it

the hearts actions

are neither the sentence nor its reprieve

salt hay and thistles above the cold granite

one bird singing back to another because it cant not

no one can usurp the heights

but those to whom the miseries of the world

are misery and will not let them rest

james from descendants of the eminent

in the world it will be women mostly colored and poor women will have to bury children and support themselves through grief

i believe in spectacles but i think eyes necessary too

the one who pulls the puppet strings knows fairytales can heal

the subtleties of the mind cannot be transmitted in words but can be seen in words

how do you know

youre a girl

im wearing a frock

and if you take

it off

i get cold so i put

it back on

if i was a boy

i dont know what

id do

i say every dog looks like no other

but that isnt true not entirely

im artistry through fluent and flowing poetry in motion and im letting it flow

i will basquiat the canvas of your body like a broadway junction wall…and gordon parks you for those dark midnights when your scent fades

don’t forget to collect the memories on your journey remember if you only focus on your destination you will miss out on the benefits of the journey

this is no occupation for an adult who can look other adults in the eye carry his own weight and count himself one of them

an english girl might well believe

that time is how you spend your love

a teacher will be frustrated if she is only motivated to teach what she has learned yet if she is motivated because of the students then she will learn from them how to teach

to dungeons deep and caverns old

we must away ere break of day

to find our longforgotten gold

in summer the empire of insects spreads

the poem doesn’t have stanzas it has a body the poem doesn’t have lines it has blood the poem is not written with letters it’s written with grains of sand and kisses petals and moments shouts and uncertainties

what am i to do

what is my destiny

i have no idea not a clue

feeling lost and empty

what is my dream

what is my future

i beg thee to listen to me

i beg thee to answer

thus i gone forth as spiders do

in spider’s web a truth discerning

attach one silken strand to you

for my returning

aint you heard

the boogiewoogie rumble

youll hear their feet

beating out and beating out a

you think

its a happy beat

listen to it closely

aint you heard

what did i say

im happy

take it away

rebop

yet gold all is not that doth gold seem

nor all good knights that shake well spear and shield

the worth of all men by their end esteem

and then praise or due reproach them yield

once upon a time son

they used to laugh with their hearts

and laugh with their eyes

but now they only laugh with their teeth

while their iceblockcold eyes

search behind my shadow

there was a time indeed

they used to shake hands with their hearts

but that’s gone son

now they shake hands without hearts

while their left hands search

my empty pockets

a world without poetry and art would be too much like one without birds or flowers bearable but a lot less enjoyable

along the field as we came by

a year ago my love and i

the aspen over stile and stone

was talking to itself alone

oh who are these that kiss and pass

a country lover and his lass

two lovers looking to be wed

and time shall put them both to bed

but she shall lie with earth above

and he beside another love

and sure enough beneath the tree

there walks another love with me

and overhead the aspen heaves

its rainysounding silver leaves

and i spell nothing in their stir

but now perhaps they speak to her

and plain for her to understand

they talk about a time at hand

when i shall sleep with clover clad

and she beside another lad

ill need many stones

if im going to get over

in the country whereto i go

i shall not see the face of my friend

nor her hair the color of sunburnt grasses

together we shall not find

the land on whose hills bends the new moon

what have i thought of love

i have said it is beauty and sorrow

i have thought that it would bring me lost delights and splendor

as a wind out of old time

but there is only the evening here

and the sound of willows

now and again dipping their long oval leaves in the water

from betrothed

song of myself

a child said what is the grass fetching it to me with full hands

how could i answer the child i do not know what it is any more than he

i guess it must be the flag of my disposition out of hopeful green

or i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord

a scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt

bearing the owners name someway in the corners that we may see

and remark and say whose

or i guess the grass is itself a child the produced babe of the vegetation

is the fumetrack of necessity this thought

if after several

applications you do not find

relief consult your family physician

no thought is a stupid thought those who are thoughtless are thought of as stupid

when the lad for longing sighs

mute and dull of cheer and pale

if at deaths own door he lies

maiden you can heal his ail

lovers ills are all to buy

the wan look the hollow tone

the hung head the sunken eye

you can have them for your own

buy them buy them eve and morn

lovers ills are all to sell

then you can lie down forlorn

but the lover will be well

there is some awe mixed with the joy of our surprise when this poet who lived in some past world two or three hundred years ago says that which lies close to my own soul that which i also had wellnigh thought and said

the world and the friends that lived in it are shadows you alone remain real in this drowsing room

what else is a poem about

the rhythm and the images buried in the language all the ways you can build an emotion with words but you cant just write i feel sad i mean you can but its not poetry i think it has to be experienced instead of studied you step into it

we lay our words like tenuous plats build a bridge over its

unsinkable depth not a sea of longing

but the brack of wanting what’s physical

to help us forget we are physical

make me dear lord polite and kind

to everyone i pray

and may i ask you how you find

yourself dear lord today

thought lengths it pulls

an invisible world through

a needles eye

one detail at a time

if you cant beat em poem

poetry is dancing with words

may the energy of the day always call for celebration barbara botch

poetry is never abandon it is only remixed

heavy as such things are

after the wordslide the writing begins

from word quake

and squinched up inside

the next day i could

whole and happy

and right

like an unbitten apple

this fellow is wise enough to play the fool

and to do that well craves a kind of wit

he must observe their mood on whom he jests

the quality of persons and the time

and like the haggard check at every feather

that comes before his eye this is a practise

as full of labour as a wise mans art

for folly that he wisely shows is fit

but wise men follyfalln quite taint their wit

when a reader enters the pages of a book of poetry he or she enters a world where dreams transform the past into knowledge made applicable to the present and where visions shape the present into extraordinary possibilities for the future

bolts of lightning from the sky

and plant them in fields of life

they will grow like tender sprouts of fire

with unexpected flash

you my lightning in the soil

nostalgia locates desire in the past where it suffers no active conflict and can be yearned toward pleasantly

nature it seems is the popular name

for milliards and milliards and milliards

of particles playing their infinite game

of billiards and billiards and billiards

o dear himalayawhy are you so amazing can i kiss your peak or can i just let your silence speako dear himalaya

little deer ive stuffed all the worlds diseases inside you  your veins are thorns  and the good cells are lost in the deep dark woods  of your organs

with shrunken fingers

we ate our oranges and bread

shivering in the parked car

though we know we had never

been there before

we knew we had been there before

a place for the genuine

hands that can grasp eyes

that can dilate hair that can rise

some thirty inches from my nose

the frontier of my person goes

and all the untilled air between

is private pagus or demesne

stranger unless with bedroom eyes

i beckon you to fraternize

beware of rudely crossing it

i have no gun but i can spit

and bluelungd combers lumbered to the kill

for a lot of people poetry tends to be dull its not read much it takes a special kind of training and a lot of practice to read poetry with pleasure its like learning to like asparagus

what is this slow blue dream of living

and this fevered death by dreaming

im heading for a cleannamed place

like wisconsin and mad as a jackolantern will get there

without help and nosy proclivities

how do i feel today i feel as unfit as an unfiddle

and it is the result of a certain turbulence in the mind and an uncertain burbulence in the middle

what was it anyway that angry thing that flew at me

i am unused to banshees crying boo at me

your wife can’t be a banshee—

or can she

the worm doth woo the mortal death claims a living bride

earth a merry damsel and heaven a knight so true

and earth is quite coquettish and beseemeth in vain to sue

from semele recycled

but then your great voice rang out under the skies

my name and all those private names

for the parts and places that had loved you best

and they stirred in their nest of hay and dung

the distraught old ladies chasing their lost altar

and the seers pursuing my skull their lost employment

and the tumbling boys who wanted the magic marbles

and the runaway groom and the fishermans thirteen children

set up such a clamor with their cries of miracle

that our two bodies met like a thunderclap

in midday right at the corner of that wretched field

with its broken fenceposts and startled skinny cattle

we fell in a heap on the compost heap

and all our loving parts made love at once

while the bystanders cheered and prayed and hid their eyes

and then went decently about their business

and here is is moonlight again weve bathed in the river

and are sweet and wholesome once more

we kneel side by side in the sand

we worship each other in whispers

but the inner parts remember fermenting hay

the comfortable odor of dung the animal incense

and passion its bloody labor

its birth and rebirth and decay

what is a woman that you forsake her

and the hearth fire and the home acre

to go with that old grey widowmaker

nobody knows the aftermath

may and after a rainy spring

we walk streets gallant with rhododendrons

a true poet is one who can appreciate the disciplines and structures of any and all styles of poetry

i have more wisdom than any books ever written in history of times any scripture ever written which you rhyme but this is not my purpose

we can’t choose our poetic fathers any more than our biological ones — but we can choose how to come to terms with them

in my more rebellious days i tried to doubt the existence of the sacred but the universe kept dancing and life kept writing poetry across my life beyond religion p

only in russia poetry is respectedit gets people killed

come drunks and drugtakers come perverts unnerved

receive the laurel given though late on merit to whom

and wherever deserved

get the hell out of the way of the laurel it is deathless

and it isnt for you

two such as you with such a master speed

cannot be parted nor be swept away

from one another once you are agreed

that life is only life forevermore

together wing to wing and oar to oar

grow high the devil cant find you

grow deep buddha cant find you

build a house and live there

gourd creepers will climb over it

their flowers dazzling at midnight

when youre a student of poetry youre lucky if you dont realize how untalented you are until you get a little better otherwise you would just stop

if you dont know the kind of person i am

and i dont know the kind of person you are

a pattern that others made may prevail in the world

and following the wrong god home we may miss our star

poetry is the least imposition on silence in a world of chatter

o the mind mind has mountains cliffs of fall

the heart under your heart

is not the one you share

so readily so full of pleasantry

it is a single blackberry

at the heart of a bramble

or else some larger fruit

heavy the size of a fist

poetry must be as new as foam and as old as the rock

every evening words not stars light the sky no rest in life like life itself

literature is not a picture of life but is a separate experience with its own kind of flow and enhancement

its not that the worm forgives the plough it gives it no mind pain occurs in passing lines  in the poem fantasia on a theme from ikea

sunlight stretches out its limbs or is it

a sycamore so brazen so clean and bold

i like the imp  in impossibility

the sea is dangerous they say but not if youre the sea

must be going crazy

my favorite poet lately

has been me

jens mum will write

jens mum writes advertising copy

she specializes in white goods

she hates these appliances

powerhungry and fractious

one day she will have a wood stove

and shell write about things that matter

she will write about birth and death

about love and the absence of love

about fathers and children

about mothers and daughters

about lovers and friends

shell write about the whole goddamn

of loving and being loved

the sharp

on the rim

of the spoon

of my giving

lines  of the poem confessions

some wrong eternity that wouldn’t budge like trying to move a wardrobe or a safe only to feel how light i was

with heaven in our hearts

with glimpses of

the universe dancing

i recall that now and i recall everything for what do we have

but the past to parent us

logic when applied to people fails miserably

id love to give you something

but what would help

the world is holy the soul is holy the skin is holy

the nose is holy the tongue and cock and hand

and asshole holy

everything is holy everybodys holy everywhere is

holy everyday is in eternity everymans an

with wine and being lost with

less and less of both

i rode through the snow do you read me

near he sang

it was

our last ride over

the hurdled humans

they cowered when

they heard us

overhead they

wrote they

lied our neighing

into one of their

i give you the end of a golden string

only wind it into a ball

it will lead you in at heavens gate

built in jerusalems wall

a poet dares be just so clear and no clearer he unzips the veil from beauty but does not remove it a poet utterly clear is a trifle glaring

what delightful hosts are they—

life and love

this late hour yet glad enough

they have not withheld from me

their high hospitality

so with face lit with delight

and all gratitude i stay

yet to press their hands and say

thanks—so fine a time good night

the poet is the sayer the namer and represents beauty

and round about there is a rabble

of the filthy sturdy unkillable infants of the very poor

they shall inherit the earth

you cant be with god and be neutral  true contemplation is resistance and poetry  gazing at clouds is resistance i found out in jail

green arsenic smeared on an eggwhite cloth

crushed strawberries come let us feast our eyes

i wrote stubbornly into the evening

at the window a giant praying mantis

rubbed his monkey wrench head against the glass

begging vacantly with pale eyes

and the commas leapt at me like worms

or miniature scythes blackened with age

the praying mantis screeched louder

his ragged jaws opening into formlessness

the grass hissed at my heels

up ahead in the lapping darkness

he wobbled magnified and absurdly green

raise from your bed of languor

raise from your bed of dismay

your friends will not come tomorrow

as they did not come today

you must rely on yourself they said

you must rely on yourself

oh but i find this pill so bitter said the poor man

as he took it from the shelf

crying o sweet death come to me

come to me for company

sweet death it is only you i can

noone knows and noone sees

we lovers doing what we please

but people stop and point at these

ten milk bottles aturning into cheese

i used the word prose in the transsiberian in the early latin sense of prosa dictu poem seemed to me too pretentious too narrow prose is more open popular

of butchers knives the only animal

that ate its weaker siblings in the womb

immune from cancer constantly awake

be polite at the reception desk

not all the knives are in the museum

the waitresses know that a nice boy

is formed in the same way as a deckchair

pay for the beer and send flowers

introduce yourself as richard

do not refer to what somebody did

at a particular time in the past

remember every friday we used to go

for a walk i walked you walked

everything in the past is irregular

this steak is very good sit down

there is no wine but there is ice cream

wild creatures eyes the colonel said

are innocent and fathomless

and when i look at them i see

that they are not aware of me

and oh i find and oh i bless

a comfort in this emptiness

they only see me when they want

to pounce upon me at the hunt

but in the tame variety

there couches an anxiety

as if they yearned yet knew not what

they yearned for nor they yearned for not

and so my dog would look at me

and it was pitiful to see

such love and such dependency

the human heart is not at ease

with animals that look like these

you bend the nail

but keep hammering because

hammering makes the world

i am five i will never understand

why we are stranded in our selves

but in this moment i know

my own story

is understanding our singleness

that i am destined to move my body and time

into the bodytime

the story

poetry like all imaginative creations divines the human enterprise this is poetrys social value

poetry is a way of coming to know the realness of things fiction is a way of coming to know the world of relationships nonfiction is a way of coming to know the world of the mind

the next time you hear someone in a workshop remarking on how good a particular freeverse line or passage sounds scan it the odds are that it will fall into a regular metrical pattern

i was the solitary plover

for a wingbone

from the secret notes

upon the pressure

execute and adjust

we live by the urgent wave

of the verse

it is not growing like a tree

in bulk doth make man better be

or standing long an oak three hundred year

to fall a log at last dry bald and sere

although it fall and die that night

it was the plant and flower of light

in small proportions we just beauties see

and in short measures life may perfect be ben jonson

ted a fucking good poem is a weapon

its and not like a

a popgun or something

its a bomb

its like a bloody big bomb

sylvia that’s why they make children

learn them in school

they dont want them messing about

with them on their own

i mean just imagine

if a sonnet went off accidentally

criticism is to poetry as air is to a noise it allows it to be heard and even if we cant see it or feel it it is there shaping how we hear

tho youre tired

and weary still journey on

till you come to

your happy abode

where all the love

youve been dreaming of

will be there at

the end of the road

know that there is often hidden in us a dormant poet always young and alive

the journey back is always longer than the forward run

evil is not goods absence but gravitys

everlasting bedrock and its fatal chains

inert violent the suffrage of our days

we left you there lonely

beauty your power

wisdom your watchman

to hold the clay tower

from the tale of the tiger tree

my vegetable love will grow

vaster than empires and more slow

the plot against the giant

when this yokel comes maundering

whetting his hacker

i shall run before him

diffusing the civilest odors

out of geraniums and unsmelled flowers

it will check him

i shall run before him

arching cloths besprinkled with colors

as small as fisheggs

the threads

will abash him

i shall run before him

with a curious puffing

he will bend his ear then

it will undo him

streets paved with opal sadness

lead me counterclockwise to pockets of joy

and jazz

my name used to be in the papers daily

as having dined somewhere

or traveled somewhere

or rented a house in paris

where i entertained the nobility

i was forever eating or traveling

or taking the cure at badenbaden

now i am here to do honor

to spoon river here beside the family whence i sprang

no one cares now where i dined

or lived or whom i entertained

or how often i took the cure at badenbaden

deep in the dwarf orchard

the sky with its undercoat of blackwash and point stars

i stand in the dark and answer to

my life this shirt i want to take off

which is on fire

thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear

up telephone poles

which rear half out of leavage

as though they would shriek

like things smothered by their own

in georgia the legend says

that you must close your windows

at night to keep it out of the house

the glass is tinged with green even so

as the tendrils crawl over the fields

the night the kudzu has

your pasture you sleep like the dead

silence has grown oriental

and you cannot step upon the ground

all kudzu by james dickey

our beasts and our thieves and our chattels

have weight for good or for ill

but the poor are only his image

his presence his word his will

and so lazarus lies at our doorstep

and dives neglects him still

poetry is what he turns to these days finding in its fragmentation the proper echo of the disintegrating world

i am stuck in traffic in a taxicab

which is typical

and not just of modern life

the artistic reward for refuting the received national tradition is liberation the price is homelessness interior exile

silence is a cage these words are my keys

its plain to see for those who will to see from within and how common and strange things really seem to be when you start to change your planes of perceptionas change in the mind persist so shall change in thoughts words and deeds assist

on the day you couldnt hold yourself together anymore

you called for me voice crackling like two sets of knuckles

before an altercation

i found you looking like a damaged wine glass

i hugged your shatter i cut all of my fingers

trying to jigsaw puzzle you back together

when it was over

you looked at the stains on the carpet

and blamed me for making a mess

i am strange

so please

don’t think i don’t love you

because the truth

is the opposite

there is only one thing that is more natural than thinking breathing and it is in breathing that we find the door to happiness

my hunger too has both hard and soft parts

and i am so alone

and i am alone here

with the idea of ghosts

and the idea of humanity which is a cruel idea

you mean the moon

a flower red has caught his eye

he cannot touch her though he try

in darkness glints the tears he cries

i see mere stars you boldly lie

nay poetry to draw your sigh

i am immune

speak roofless nature your instinctive words

and let me learn your secret from the sky

in lone remote migration beating by

december stillness crossed by twilight roads

teach me to travel far and bear my loads

after the final no there comes a yes and on that yes the future world depends no was the night yes is this present sun

silence is a cage these words are my wings

song of sunset on the river

a strip of waters spread in the setting sun

half the rivers emerald half is red

i love the third night of the ninth month

the dew is like pearl the moon like a bow

and we who loved the world must learn the language of absence days foreshortened empty rooms the irrevocable distance between the goodbye and the letting go

in the moment between sleep and wake

i kiss my blanket

kissing you goodbye

why do we write a chorus erupts

because we cannot simply live

come with me

and you will find

whats been trapped

inside my mind

i am for

one world without fear and corruption

one world ruled by truth and justice

i am for

one peaceful world for all

where hate has been overcome by love

and everyone is guided only

by their conscience

they say

they only want

to grow from

my mouth

so i will

look them

in the

as i

my lips

with

my jaw

them

down

their feet

i will never be your expectations of me

lovers meander in prose and rhyme

trying to say

for the thousandth time

whats easier done than said

people start to lie more once they start to care less

the pressure

after centuries

we can become brilliant gems

and we will be immortal after all

who i am remains to be seen— and i alone intend to be the one to see it

you bear a sword and shield remind me

of her labor her stoning gaze what beast

will your blade free next what call will you loose

from another womans throat

she had a habit of walking around in white cotton panties and writing poetry on the back of crumpled envelopes

i hate forcing myself to go to bed to avoid committing suicide

the poem in the head is always perfect resistance starts when you try to convert it into language language itself is a kind of resistance to the pure flow of self

look at her touching his cheek

to make a truce her fingers

cool with spring rain

even here even at the beginning of love

her hand leaving his face makes

an image of departure

and they think

they are free to overlook

this sadness

the throes of poetry  hymns formed from groans of acquaintance its rhythm weaving between tranquility compassions and peril  like bare feet stomping on broken glass  bleeds recoils then steps again

from the first cup of coffee in the morning

to playing in the sheets at night i choose you to be by my side

moments caught in time simple memories spread out before me timeless reminders of how life goes on even when it feels as if you cannot

a man was found floating dead in the san francisco bay a note in his pocket read i wont jump if someone smiles at me today

i have no heart perhaps i have not  but then youre mad to take offense  that i dont give you what i have not got  use your own common sense

along with the rest of our helpless world and o if you could you would where lovers walked sell off trees and not give a flying fuck for the muted mausoleums of the bees

three things have a limited threshold

time pain and death

while truth love and knowledge –

are boundless

three things are needed

for humanity to coexist

truth peace and basic needs

it was her laughter that made me love her her shy inappropriate madness is what made her beautiful

i don’t need the facts i’m a pisces

love doesn’t make you a poet it makes you poetry

no crime is a means to an end no crime can be rationalized

a versifier passes through the sound sounds go through a poet

beauty can be born out of not only love but also pain and other motivations
