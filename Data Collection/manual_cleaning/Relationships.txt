when someone loves you the way they talk about you is different you feel safe and comfortable

indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike

the meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances if there is any reaction both are transformed

a guy and a girl can be just friends but at one point or another they will fall for each othermaybe temporarily maybe at the wrong time maybe too late or maybe forever

for the two of us home isnt a place it is a person and we are finally home

man may have discovered fire but women discovered how to play with it

i will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way

i mean if the relationship cant survive the long term why on earth would it be worth my time and energy for the short term

the most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much and forgetting that you are special too

why is it he said one time at the subway entrance i feel ive known you so many years

because i like you she said and i dont want anything from you

when you stop expecting people to be perfect you can like them for who they are

every man i meet wants to protect me i cant figure out what from

there is greatness in doing something you hate for the sake of someone you love

if conversation was the lyrics laughter was the music making time spent together a melody that could be replayed over and over without getting stale

i know i am but summer to your heart and not the full four seasons of the year

its no good pretending that any relationship has a future if your record collections disagree violently or if your favorite films wouldnt even speak to each other if they met at a party

come sleep with me we wont make love love will make us

holding eleanors hand was like holding a butterfly or a heartbeat like holding something complete and completely alive

maybe our girlfriends are our soulmates and guys are just people to have fun with

to be fully seen by somebody then and be loved anyhow  this is a human offering that can border on miraculous

i’ve been fighting to be who i am all my life what’s the point of being who i am if i can’t have the person who was worth all the fighting for

i suffer from girlnextdooritis where the guy is friends with you and thats it

i want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me

man when you lose your laugh you lose your footing

never marry at all dorian men marry because they are tired women because they are curious both are disappointed

every couple needs to argue now and then just to prove that the relationship is strong enough to survive longterm relationships the ones that matter are all about weathering the peaks and the valleys

i know enough to know that no woman should ever marry a man who hated his mother

for there to be betrayal there would have to have been trust first

when you dont talk theres a lot of stuff that ends up not getting said

to say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around is a paradox people eventually get sick of waiting take a chance on someone and by the art of commitment become soulmates which takes a lifetime to perfect

cheating and lying arent struggles theyre reasons to break up

our wounds are often the openings into the best and most beautiful part of us

i used to advertise my loyalty and i dont believe there is a single person i loved that i didnt eventually betray

relationships dont always make sense especially from the outside

every couple has ups and downs every couple argues and that’s the thing—you’re a couple and couples can’t function without trust

those sweet lips my oh my i could kiss those lips all night long

good things come to those who wait

a dame that knows the ropes isnt likely to get tied up

if you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart then youre allowing them to hurt you a second time in your mind

i may not always be with you

but when were far apart

remember you will be with me

right inside my heart

i know my heart will never be the same

but im telling myself ill be okay

women cannot complain about men anymore until they start getting better taste in them

what we wait around a lifetime for with one person we can find in a moment with someone else

nothing in this world was more difficult than love

i think you are wrong to want a heart it makes most people unhappy if you only knew it you are in luck not to have a heart

it is an absolute human certainty that no one can know his own beauty or perceive a sense of his own worth until it has been reflected back to him in the mirror of another loving caring human being

books are a poor substitute for female companionship but they are easier to find

dont leave a piece of jewelry at his house so you can go back and get it later he may be with his real girlfriend

because i cant help doing it he said with a shrug and hey if i keep loving you maybe youll eventually crack and love me too hell im pretty sure youre already half in love with me

i am not and everything you just said is ridiculous thats terrible logic

i dont think youre evil

see things are already looking promising

we kiss all the time i clear my throat then add we justdo it in private

a smug expression crosses his face i dont buy it for a second cause if you were my girlfriend and a stud like me was livin in your house id kiss you in front of the guy every chance i got as a reminder

a reminder of wwwhat

that you were mine

he could totally be your boyfriend angel went on with annoying persistance you guys could get married i could be like a junior bridesmaid total could be your flower dog

im only a kid i shrieked i cant get married

you could in new hampshire

my mouth dropped open how does she know this stuff forget it no ones getting married i hissed not in new hampshire or anywhere else not in a box not with a fox now go to sleep before i kill you

you’re just another story i can’t tell anymore

moving on is easy its staying moved on thats trickier

how would your life be different if…you walked away from gossip and verbal defamation let today be the day…you speak only the good you know of other people and encourage others to do the same

i find the best way to love someone is not to change them but instead help them reveal the greatest version of themselves

every woman that finally figured out her worth has picked up her suitcases of pride and boarded a flight to freedom which landed in the valley of change

a fit healthy body—that is the best fashion statement

seldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken

sometimes it takes a heartbreak to shake us awake  help us see we are worth so much more than were settling for

we have to recognise that there cannot be relationships unless there is commitment unless there is loyalty unless there is love patience persistence

we die containing a richness of lovers and tribes tastes we have swallowed bodies we have plunged into and swum up as if rivers of wisdom characters we have climbed into as if trees fears we have hidden in as if caves

there comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page write another book or simply close it

only someone who is ready for everything who doesnt exclude any experience even the most incomprehensible will live the relationship with another person as something alive and will himself sound the depths of his own being

you can measure the happiness of a marriage by the number of scars that each partner carries on their tongues earned from years of biting back angry words

i felt like an animal and animals don’t know sin do they

when we face pain in relationships our first response is often to sever bonds rather than to maintain commitment

this is what happened in love one of you cried a lot and then both of you grew sarcastic

mocking a woman is like drinking too much wine it may be fun for a short time but the hangover is hell

most everything you think you know about me is nothing more than memories

if you need something from somebody always give that person a way to hand it to you

do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman wholl give you a little love a little affection a little tenderness it means youre in the wrong house thats what it means

when dealing with people remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic but with creatures bristling with prejudice and motivated by pride and vanity

its probably a bad indicator of your lifestyle when you miss your exboyfriend because hes absolutely lethal

when you hold a grudge you want someone else’s sorrow to reflect your level of hurt but the two rarely meet

a busy vibrant goaloriented woman is so much more attractive than a woman who waits around for a man to validate her existence

you can take this mouth

this wound you want

but you cant kiss

and make it

i define connection as the energy that exists between people when they feel seen heard and valued when they can give and receive without judgment and when they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship

statistically speaking there is a  percent chance that the love of your life is having an affair be very suspicious

vday…if you need this one day in a year to show everyone else you truly care for your loved one i think it’s quite stupid i hate this commercialism it’s all artificial and has nothing to do with real love

there are so many things that demand to be said where did you go do you ever think about me youve ruined me are you okay but of course i cant say any of that

six hundred and forty fish later the only thing i know is everything you love will die the first time you meet someone special you can count on them one day being dead and in the ground

failed relationships can be described as so much wasted makeup

can officially confirm that the way to a mans heart these days is not through beauty food sex or alluringness of character but merely the ability to seem not very interested in him

last night i got up the courage to ask you if you regretted us

there are things i miss you said but if i didnt have you id miss more

the best relationships in our lives are the best not because they have been the happiest ones they are that way because they have stayed strong through the most tormentful of storms

when you struggle with your partner you are struggling with yourself every fault you see in them touches a denied weakness in yourself

a true gentleman is one that apologizes anyways even though he has not offended a lady intentionally he is in a class all of his own because he knows the value of a womans heart

i want to be around people that do things i don’t want to be around people anymore that judge or talk about what people do i want to be around people that dream and support and do things

when you loved someone and had to let them go there will always be that small part of yourself that whispers what was it that you wanted and why didnt you fight for it

people die i think but your relationship with them doesnt it continues and is everchanging

lonely people tend rather to be lonely because they decline to bear the psychic costs of being around other humans they are allergic to people people affect them too strongly

he loved her for almost everything she was  she decided that was enough to let him stay for a very long time

unrequited love is the infinite curse of a lonely heart

love doesnt mean anything if youre not willing to make a commitment and you have to think not only about what you want but about what he wants not just now but in the future

i have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes what matters is not what i think of him but what he thinks of himself hurting a man in his dignity is a crime

when what you hear and what you see dont match trust your eyes

we all take different paths in life but no matter where we go we take a little of each other everyhwere

when god knows youre ready for the responsibility of commitment hell reveal the right person under the right circumstances

you fit into me

like a hook into an eye

an open eye

hope for love pray for love wish for love dream for love…but don’t put your life on hold waiting for love

annabeth he said hesitantly in new rome demigods can live their whole lives in peace

her expression turned guarded reyna explained it to me but percy you belong at camp halfblood that other life—

it was hard to tell in the golden light but he thought annabeth was blushing oh she said…

i’m sorry he said i just…i had to think of that to keep going to give me hope forget i mentioned—

no she said gods percy that’s so sweet

dont worry about hurting me if thats what youre afraid of i want to get hurt at least i´ll feel something for a change

you cant lose something you never had

we ruined each other by being together we destroyed each other’s dreams

rejection is an opportunity for your selection

one of the best times for figuring out who you are  what you really want out of life right after a breakup

trust is the fruit of a relationship in which you know you are loved

you know someones right for you when the things they dont have to say are even more important than the things they do

sometimes i get real lonely sleeping with you

my head’ll explode if i continue with this escapism

if youre trapped in the dream of the other youre fucked

trust is the glue of life its the most essential ingredient in effective communication its the foundational principle that holds all relationships

that night when you kissed me i left a poem in your mouth and you can hear some of the lines every time you breathe out

the words ‘i love you’ kill and resurrect millions in less than a second

she was a beautiful dreamer the kind of girl who kept her head in the clouds loved above the stars and left regret beneath the earth she walked on

wanting him to come back before anyone notices part of the world has not moved since he left

you couldnt just pick and choose at will when someone depended on you or loved you it wasnt like a light switch easy to turn on or off if you were in you were in out you were out

you know that when i hate you it is because i love you to a point of passion that unhinges my soul

i got my hearts desire and there my troubles began

i justi just miss him and i hate being so alone

my girlfriend is sad and quiet and keeps me up all night worrying about her

submission is not about authority and it is not obedience it is all about relationships of love and respect

most men claim to desire driven independent and confident women yet when confronted with such a creature reverence often evolves into resent for just like women men need to be needed

intimacy is the capacity to be rather weird with someone  and finding that thats ok with them

if equal affection cannot be

let the more loving one be me

yes clary thought no she said

we are not written for one instrument alone i am not neither are you

we rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new but to feel nothing so as not to feel anything—what a waste

the reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves the basis of optimism is sheer terror

we know from daily life that we exist for other people first of all for whose smiles and wellbeing our own happiness depends

have you ever noticed how parents can go from the most wonderful people in the world to totally embarrassing in three seconds

how could i be sleeping with this particular man surely only true love could justify my lack of taste

i believe in love the verb not the noun

not the kind you see in the movies or hear about on the radio

the real kind

the kind that gets beaten down and bloody yet perseveres

the kind that hopes even when hope seems foolish

the kind that can forgive the kind that believes in healing

the kind that can sit in silence and feel renewed

the real kind of love

its rare and we have it

thought i couldnt live without you

its gonna hurt when it heals too

even though i really love you

im gonna smile cause i deserve to

quickly im learning to love again

all i know is imma be ok

because isn’t that the point of every relationship to be known by someone else to be understood he gets me she gets me isn’t that the simple magic phrase

and now you are and i am and were a mystery which will never happen again

learn to deal with the fact that you are not a perfect person but you are a person that deserves respect and honesty

im not crying because of you youre not worth it im crying because my delusion of who you were was shattered by the truth of who you are

what you want most you push away from you

you want more than you care to admit

if you have the woman you love what more do you need well besides an alibi for the time of her husband’s murder

assumptions are the termites of relationships

i suppose that since most of our hurts come through relationships so will our healing and i know that grace rarely makes sense for those looking in from the outside

this love of which i speak is slow to lose patience  it looks for a way of being constructive

love is not possessive

love is not anxious to impress nor does it cherish inflated ideas of its own ideas

love has good manners and does not pursue selfish advantage

love is not touchy

love does not keep account of evil or gloat over the wickedness of other people on the contrary it is glad with all good men when truth prevails

love knows no limits to its endurance no end to its trust no fading of its hope it can outlast anything it is in fact the one thing that stands when all else has fallen

i would rather a romantic relationship turn into contempt than turn into apathy the passion in the extremities make it appear as though it once meant something we grow from hot or cold but lukewarm is the biggest insult

frida kahlo to marty mcconnell

leaving is not enough you must

stay gone train your heart

like a dog change the locks

even on the house he’s never

visited you lucky lucky girl

you have an apartment

just your size a bathtub

full of tea a heart the size

of arizona but not nearly

so arid don’t wish away

your cracked past your

crooked toes your problems

are papier mache puppets

you made or bought because the vendor

at the market was so compelling you just

had to have them you had to have him

and you did and now you pull down

the bridge between your houses

you make him call before

he visits you take a lover

for granted you take

a lover who looks at you

like maybe you are magic make

the first bottle you consume

in this place a relic place it

on whatever altar you fashion

with a knife and five cranberries

don’t lose too much weight

stupid girls are always trying

to disappear as revenge and you

are not stupid you loved a man

with more hands than a parade

of beggars and here you stand heart

heart leaking something so strong

they can smell it in the street

i believe in the immeasurable power of love that true love can endure any circumstance and reach across any distance

the quickest way to rectify that mistake choosing the wrong person is by learning from that moving on and choosing much more wisely in the future

yes its a wellknown fact about you youre like death you take everything

love cannot live where there is no trust

but why why why cant people just say what they mean

you think that holding someone hard will bring them closer you think that you can hold them so hard that youll still feel them embossed on you when you pull away

every time eleanor pulled away from park she felt the gasping loss of him

if a man can possess a woman sexually really possess he wont need to control her ideas her opinions her clothes her friends even her other lovers

mutual caring relationships require kindness and patience tolerance optimism joy in the others achievements confidence in oneself and the ability to give without undue thought of gain

some people come into our lives and leave footprints on our hearts and we are never ever the same

siblings children of the same parents each of whom is perfectly normal until they get together

if you spend your life sparing people’s feelings and feeding their vanity you get so you can’t distinguish what should be respected in them

caring about someone isnt complicated it isnt easy but it isnt complicated either kinda like lifting the engine block out of a car

why don’t we break up i guess i stay with her because she stays with me and that’s not an easy thing to do

your absence has not taught me to be alone it merely has shown that when together we cast a single shadow on the wall

the end of a relationship is not always a failure sometimes all the love in the world is not enough to save something in these cases it is not a matter of fault from either person some things cannot be its as simple as that

death is the easy part the hard part is living and knowing you could be so much more then you’re willing to be

i felt silly for even mentioning it but once i did i knew i had to explain

for a moment you were quiet and then you nestled in and whispered

and i knew you understood

making love to me is amazing wait i meant making love to me is amazing the absence of two little commas nearly transformed me into a sex god

my love is pizza shaped won’t you have a slice it’s circular so there’s enough to go around

you like every one that is to say you are indifferent to every one

the opposite of love is not hate  its apathy its not giving a damn if somebody hates me they must feel something  or they couldnt possibly hate therefore theres some way in which i can get to them

it’s hard to communicate anything exactly and that’s why perfect relationships between people are difficult to find

if i never see you again

i will always carry you

on my fingertips

and at brain edges

and in centers

of what i am of

what remains

being single doesnt mean youre weak it means that youre strong enough to wait for the right person

when forever becomes a placewhen forever ceases to be just a word… when it ceases to be just a measurement of time…but instead becomes a place where soul mates can dance to the song in their hearts that is a reflection of true love

right now we are here and nothing can mar our perfection or steal the joy of this perfect moment

husbands are chiefly good as lovers when they are betraying their wives

love lasts about seven years thats how long it takes for the cells of the body to totally replace themselves

we met each other when we were young before we knew enough about disappointment and once we did we found we reminded each other of it

i didnt know someone could love me like this she said could love me and love me and love me withoutneeding space

lincoln wasnt asleep he rolled on top of her

theres no air in space he said

he may love you he may miss you but ultimately hes just not that into you

single is no longer a lack of options – but a choice a choice to refuse to let your life be defined by your relationship status but to live every day happily and let your ever after work itself out

ultimately the bond of all companionship whether in marriage or in friendship is conversation and conversation must have a common basis and between two people of widely different culture the only common basis possible is the lowest level

when we fail to set boundaries and hold people accountable we feel used and mistreated this is why we sometimes attack who they are which is far more hurtful than addressing a behavior or a choice

please touch me i pray

i believe with all my heart that the cliches are true that we are our own best friends and best company and that if youre not right for yourself its impossible to be right for anyone

sometimes the most beautiful people are beautifully broken

my wife and i just dont have the same feelings for each other we used to have i guess i just dont love her anymore and she doesnt love me what can i do

the feeling isnt there anymore i asked

thats right he reaffirmed and we have three children were really concerned about what do you suggest

i told you the feeling just isnt there anymore

you dont understand the feeling of love just isnt there

then love her if the feeling isnt there thats a good reason to love her

but how do you love when you dont love

my friend  love is a verb love  the feeling  is a fruit of love the verb so love her serve her sacrifice listen to her empathize appreciate affirm her are you willing to do that

i make love with a focus and intensity that most people reserve for sleep

she asked if i loved another woman so i answered honestly and said dinner was great but i could go for dessert

its not your job to like me  its mine

maybe you could be mine  or maybe we’ll be entwined  aimless in this sexless foreplay

its just the most amazing thing to love a dog isnt it it makes our relationships with people seem as boring as a bowl of oatmeal

to wisely live your life you dont need to know much

just remember two main rules for the beginning

you better starve than eat whatever

and better be alone than with whoever

a man is lucky if he is the first love of a woman a woman is lucky if she is the last love of a man

you can be in love and you can be in a relationship but they’re not always the same thing

i could’ve sworn i was telling the truth when i told you i didn’t miss you

all i want from you is to trust me with what little you can and grow in loving people around you with the same love i share with you its not your job to change them or to convince them you are free to love without an agenda

i used to think i knew everything i was a smart person who got things done and because of that the higher i climbed the more i could look down and scoff at what seemed silly or simple even religion

there isnt time so brief is life for bickerings apologies heartburnings callings to account there is only time for loving and but an instant so to speak for that

but it is impossible to go through life without trust that is to be imprisoned in the worst cell of all oneself

the most important relationship in your life is the relationship you have with yourself because no matter what happens you will always be with yourself

when you say i and my too much you lose the capacity to understand the we and our

he knew me in all the ways that truly mattered the shape of my fears the contours of my dreams

be sure its your real self youre showing because it is your real self that needs to be loved

i miss you in waves and tonight i’m drowning you left me fending for my life and it feels like you’re the only one who can bring me back to the shore alive

the true measure of a man is how he treats you when others are not looking

life contains but two tragedies one is not to get your heart’s desire the other is to get it

don’t spoil me with your lies love me with your truth

i once loved a girl who almost loved me but not as much as she loved john cusack

there are all kinds of ways for a relationship to be tested even broken some irrevocably it’s the endings we’re unprepared for

people are islands she said they dont really touch however close they are theyre really quite separate even if theyve been married for fifty years

a tamed woman will never leave her mark in the world

to find out if she really loved me i hooked her up to a lie detector and just as i suspected my machine was broken

the best you can hope for in a relationship is to find

someone whose flaws are the sort you don’t mind it is

futile to look for someone who has no flaws or someone

who is capable of significant change that sort of person

exists only in our imaginations

i realized i’m in love its always been right in front of me

how would your life be different if…you approached all relationships with authenticity and honesty let today be the day…you dedicate yourself to building relationships on the solid foundation of truth and authenticity

find a woman who makes you feel more alive she wont make life perfect but shell make it infinitely more interesting and then love her with all thats in you

no matter how much you love someone you still want to have you own way

human relationships always help us to carry on because they always presuppose further developments a future  and also because we live as if our only task was precisely to have relationships with other people

share too much and someone can hurt you

people will walk in and walk out of your life but the one whose footstep made a long lasting impression is the one you should never allow to walk out

a woman can become a mans friend only in the following stages  first an acquantaince next a mistress and only then a friend

hide yourself in god so when a man wants to find you he will have to go there first

the desire to love someone always exceeds the desire to be loved by someone  thats exactly why we end up loving the person who doesnt deserve that love

they hurt you you hurt em back or maybe it is the other way around whatever someday you might find a way to forgive each other but it wont be like it used to cause that pain never really goes away

you want to take me to a movie i asked

well not really he said what i really want is for you to be my girlfriend but i thought saying that might scare you off

either you go to america with mrs van hopper or you come home to manderley with me

do you mean you want a secretary or something

no im asking you to marry me you little fool

she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones because when tired of them the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for and the latter were less manageable

he doesnt need to be reminded youre great

lately i cant help wanting us

to be like other people

for example if i were a smoker

youd lift a match to the cigarette

just as i put it between my lips

its never been like that

between us none of that

easy chemistry no quick half automatic

flares everything between us

had to be learned

behind my book all my fantasies

of seduction run up

against the rocks

tell me again

why you dont like

sex in the afternoon

no dont tell me

ill never understand you

never understand us americas strangest

loving couple they never

and rarely look at each other

into each others eyes i mean

two separate beings in different circumstances face to face in freedom and seeking justification of their existence through one another will always live an adventure full of risk and promise p

we know so little about one another we embrace a shadow and love a dream

the best kind of humans are the ones who stay

i’m not scared

of the monsters

my bed

i’m much more scared

of the boys

with messy brown hair

that only know

how to form

i never hated a man enough to give him his diamonds back

it’s all about falling in love with yourself and sharing that love with someone who appreciates you rather than looking for love to compensate for a self love deficit

if youre right  im not im going to be hell to live with she said so you better think about that next time you want to be right

sometimes to selfdiscover you must selfdestruct

if he cant handle you at your worst then he does not deserve you at your best real love means seeing beyond the words spoken out of pain and instead seeing a persons soul

better to put your heart on the line risk everything and walk away with nothing than play it safe love is a lot of things but safe isn’t one of them

somewhere along the way we all go a bit mad so burn let go and dive into the horror because maybe it’s the chaos which helps us find where we belong

laughter is more than just a pleasurable activitywhen people laugh together they tend to talk and touch more and to make eye contact more frequently

tell me whom you haunt and i’ll tell you who you are

so many believe that it is love that grows but it is the knowing that grows and love simply expands to contain it

life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship

funny how we take it for granted that we know all there is to know about another person just because we see them frequently or because of some strong emotional tie

what a relationship looks like on the outside isnt the same as what its like on the inside you can be more in love with someone in your mind than with the person you see every day

we walked to meet each other up at the time of our love and then we have been irresistibly drifting in different directions and theres no altering that

we swallowed the chaos because we knew we didnt want to be ordinary

love doesn’t have to be on valentine’s day it doesn’t have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirtythree or fiftynine it doesn’t have to conform to whatever is usual it doesn’t have to be kismet at once or rhapsody by the third day

it just has to be in time in place in spirt

it just has to be

this emotion im feeling now this is love right

i dont know is it a longing is it a giddy stupid happiness just because youre with me

yes she said

thats influenza said miro watch for nausea or diarrhea within a few hours

youll blow up a helicopter but you wont go out with me what is wrong with you

everything you want in life is a relationship away

he who wants a rose must respect her thorn

you think being dead inside is bad until someone brings you back to life and stabs you in the chest without the intention of killing you

love has no limitations it cannot be measured it has no boundaries although many have tried love is indefinable

never judge someone by their relatives

women writers make for rewarding and efficient lovers they are clever liars to fathers and husbands yet they never hold their tongues too long nor keep ardent typing fingers still

madness and chaos are selfdestructing but over thinking is the suicide

they lay silently she was staring at something across the room she was making him feel uncomfortable it wouldnt work its the attraction of opposites he said

were not opposites

i dont mean just you and me women fall in love when they get to know you men are just the opposite when they finally know you theyre ready to leave

in this story

i am the poet

youre the poetry

theresa i know theres a part of you that believes you can change someone but the reality is that you cant you can change yourself and garrett can change himself but you cant do it for him

people generally didnt cheat in good relationships

your heart’s strength is measured by how hard it holds on your self worth and faith is measured by finally letting go however your peace is measured by how long you don’t look back

most dont deserve your tears and the ones that do will never make you cry

love one another but make not a bond of love

let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls

fill each others cup but drink not from one cup

give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf

sing and dance together and be joyous but let each one of you be alone

even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music

over time as most people fail the survivors exacting test of trustworthiness she tends to withdraw from relationships the isolation of the survivor thus persists even after she is free

my dad had limitations thats what my goodhearted mom always told us he had limitations but he meant no harm it was kind of her to say but he did do harm

how was i supposed to know what’s real and what’s not it feels like i’m the only one who doesn’t know the difference

i know im not going to be in your head all the time but once you know me ill be forever in your heart

im done i dont need anything more out of life i have you and thats enough

i had a dream about you last night the champagne was nonalcoholic you didnt notice and laughed at my jokes anyway

she is delightfully chaotic a beautiful mess loving her is a splendid adventure

in the best the friendliest and simplest relations flattery or praise is necessary just as grease is necessary to keep wheels turning

dont answer the door in a wedding dress and veil he might not think youre joking

i thought he should have realized sooner that important people dont show up very often and you should hold on to them when they do maybe i was smarter than he was all along because that was something id always known

basically all women are nurturers and healers and all men are mental patients to varying degrees

delusion detests focus and romance provides the veil

become the leader of your life lead yourself to where you want to be breathe life back into your ambitions your desires your goals your relationships

until we can receive with an open heart we are never really giving with an open heart

trust and faith bring joy to life and help relationships grow to their maximum potential

to us your power comes from one simple thing you’re a woman and we men will do

anything humanly possible to impress you so that ultimately we can be with you you’re the driving force behind why we wake up every day men go out and get jobs and hustle to make

you didnt just cheat on me you cheated on us you didnt just break my heart you broke our future

so i learned two things that night and the next day from him the perfection of a moment and the fleeting nature of it

a friend is someone whose face you can see in the dark

one minute of reconciliation is worth more than a whole life of friendship

relationships are treated like dixie cups they are the same they are disposable if it does not work drop it throw it away get another

committed bonds including marriage cannot last when this is the prevailing logic most of us are unclear about what to do to protect and strengthen caring bonds when our selfcentered needs are not being met

i think when men hear that women want a commitment they think it means commitment to a romantic relationship but thats not it its a commitment to not floating around anywhere i want a guy who is entrenched in his own life

she was broken i think it’s because she loved too much and she was always blind to the fact that love too is sometimes broken

why be alone when we can be together baby

you can make my life worthwhile

and i can make you start to smile

a broken heart is just the growing pains necessary so that you can love more completely when the real thing comes along

i used to loathe ambivalence now i adore it ambivalence is my new best friend

never knew what a friendship was never knew how to really love you cant be what i need you to  i dont know why i fuck with you

somewhere between love and hate lies confusion misunderstanding and desperate hope

appreciate the moment of a first kiss it may be the last time you own your heart

the strength of a man isnt seen in the power of his arms its seen in the love with which he embraces you

society will always be too fragile to accept us for all that makes us beautiful

the heart is like a woman and the head is like a man and although man is the head of woman woman is the heart of man and she turns mans head because she turns his heart

there is no mystery thats the beauty of it we are entirely explicable to each other and yet we stay what a miracle that is

i can see that the sadness has returned and its not a beautiful sadness beautiful sadness is a myth sadness turns our features to clay not porcelain

be a bit of a challenge not because youre playing games but because you realize youre worth the extra effort

i will never deny that life isnt fair it seems as though when a woman leaves a man she is strong and independent but when a man leaves a woman he is a pig and a jerk

with each reunion we had to learn each other all over again there was always that nervous moment at the airport when i would stand there waiting for him to arrive wondering will i still know him will he still know me

regrets came up and asked me if i’d like to own them declined them for the most part but took a few just so i wouldn’t leave this relationship empty handed

there was no one to be seen so she gave in freely to her sobs as she made her way home pressed her arms against her stomach the pain lodged in there like an illtempered foetus

let a person in and he hurts you

there was a reason why she kept her relationships brief dont let them in once theyre inside they have more potential to hurt you comfort yourself you can live with the anguish as long as it only involves yourself as long as there is no hope

i had a dream about you last night you were holding a pine cone and introducing him as gerald

i think of how each person in a marriage owes it to the other to find individual happiness even in a shared life that this is the only way to grow together instead of apart

i hate the way once you start to know someone care about them their behavior can distress you even when its unreasonable and not your fault even if you were really trying to be careful tactful

i need to figure out the secret i need to work out how to keep things flying back to me instead of always flying away

if i lived a million lives i wouldve felt a million feelings and i still wouldve fallen a million times for you

it’s funny for all it took was a broken heart and that alone was enough enough for her to do everything she ever dreamed of

the truth is i didn’t need therapy i just needed to feel loved and know that someone out there craved my attention

suddenly everything was beautiful the way she viewed the world was nothing more but a reflection of herself

but what are loyalty and caring really worth

to me everything

in any relationship in which two people become one the end result is two half people

i just want someone to hear what i have to say and maybe if i talk long enough it’ll make sense

asking for help with shame says

you have the power over me

asking with condescension says

i have the power over you

but asking for help with gratitude says

we have the power to help each other

theres never a reason to trust someone if theres a reason then its not trust

weve lost a lot of years but you cant lose love not real love it stays locked inside you ready for whenever you are strong enough to find it again

i had to learn to live without you and i couldnt make sense of it because i left so much of me inside of you

to be human is to be broken and broken is its own kind of beautiful

relationships are never about power and one way to avoid the will to power is to choose to limit oneself to serve

after their encounter on the approach to jupiter there would aways be a secret bond between themnot of love but of tenderness which is often more enduring

you will have five hundred million little bells and i shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water

its better to have a few faithful friends than numerous shallow friendships

our love was a twoperson game at least until one of us died and the other became a murderer

a relationship isnt something that has to be created in a day or perfected in a day part of the game is to keep working on it its something thatll always be just a little flawed

sometimes you get everything you ever wanted only it doesnt look like what you wanted anymore

i had a dream about you i was sitting on your couch relating my succession of ideas on subconscious influence i asked you what they meant and you told me that free associations were a bad way to advance my political career

over time any deception destroys intimacy and without intimacy couples cannot have true and lasting love

so that’s how we live our lives no matter how deep and fatal the

loss no matter how important the thing thats stolen from us  thats

snatched right out of our hands  even if we are left completely

changed with only the outer layer of skin from before we continue to

play out our lives this way in silence we draw ever nearer to the

end of our allotted span of time bidding it farewell as it trails off

behind repeating often adroitly the endless deeds of the everyday

maybe in some distant place everything is already quietly lost

or at least there exists a silent place where everything can

disappear melting together in a single overlapping figure and as

we live our lives we discover  drawing toward us the thin threads

attached to each  what has been lost i closed my eyes and tried to

bring to mind as many beautiful lost things as i could drawing them

closer holding on to them knowing all the while that their lives

are fleeting

men are jealous of every woman even when they don’t have the slightest interest in her themselves

to respect the dignity of a relationship also implies accepting the end when it comes except in my mind except in my dreams where the aftertaste of her still lingers

you dont stop loving someone just because you hate them

ask yourself does this person make me feel good about myself do i feel safe strong and free with this person those are the questions you need to askyou have to be strong to truly be open

it was never about the world being too big it was more like she was too much for the world to handle

when we love someone our love becomes demonstrable or real only through our exertion  through the fact that for that someone or for ourself we take an extra step or walk an extra mile love is not effortless to the contrary love is effortful

maybe i hope too much maybe i dream too much or maybe i love too much to just give up on you

if you walked away from a

relationship or friendship

— you won

nobody is so busy that they cant make time for the people they really care about

love doesnt come with an onoff switch its made of too many threads of memory and hope and heartache that weave themselves into the very core of who you are

most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly

i had a dream about you last night you were a giant slinky and i watched you fall down the stairs

the bank of love is never bankrupt

they had finally the only thing anyone really wants in life someone to hold your hand when you die

roen snorted you two have the strangest relationship in the dells

archer smiled slightly she wont consent to make it a marriage

i cant imagine whats stopping her i dont suppose youve considered being less munificent with your love

would you marry me fire if i slept in no ones bed but yours

he knew the answer to that but it didnt hurt to remind him no and i should find my bed quite cramped

when the person you love cant see your love for them beneath the painful things you say when they reject you remember this love is blind

we are the sum of all people we have ever met you change the tribe and the tribe changes you

sometimes not talking is effortless and other times it’s more exhausting than lifting pianos

was it necessary to tell me that you wanted nothing in the world but me

the corners of his mouth drooped peevishly

oh my dear its rather hard to take quite literally the things a man says when hes in love with you

didnt you mean them

at the moment

what is it about men that make women so lonely

truth is something that i thought was perfect was taken away from me and i never wanted perfect again i wanted middle of the road stuff i didn’t care about so that i couldn’t lose anything i really loved ever again

pg the body and the earth

i was trying to decide if you still had free will as a wolf if i was a terrible person for planning to drug my girlfriend and drag her back to my house to keep in the basement

some of the most beautiful things we have in life comes from our mistakes

he carries stars in his pockets

because he knows

she fears the dark

whenever sadness pays her a visit

he paints galaxies

on the back of her hands

eve if you ended up naked and dead with another woman id do the rumba on your corpse

roarke you cant do the rumba

eve id take lessons first

roarke you might very well not that youll ever get the chance but youd also grieve

eve wouldnt give you the satisfaction you cheating fwit putz

roarke youd weep in the dark and call my name

eve call your name alright how are things in hell you dickless bastard and id laugh and laugh thats how id call your name

roarke christ jesus eve i love you

a soul mate is not found a soul mate is recognized

trying to fall out of love is like trying to climb a mountain blindfolded on crutches naked in a hail storm

you cold or something he said she strained against him she wanted to pass clear through him its a chill its nothing and then pushing a little away say you love me

i said it

no oh no you havent i was listening and you never do

he sat up and glanced at a clock across the room it was after five then decisively he pulled off his windbreaker and began to unlace his shoes

arent you going to clyde

he grinned back at her yeah im going to

i dont mean that and whats more i dont like it you sound as though you were talking to a whore

come off it honey you didnt drag me up here to tell you about love

you disgust me she said

listen to her shes sore

i look back to where my life had been its always risky to think of letting go thats why this is the perfect ending nothing left to reconcile

i had a dream about you last night i was alone on a dark night and you came to me as a firefly i knew it was you because you were the brightest

some people don’t realize what they have until it’s gone but that does not always mean they are supposed to get it back

you’re not a bad person you’re just a little bit different and i’m a sucker for that

with the cure relationships are all the same and rules and expectations are defined without the cure relationships must be reinvented every day languages constantly decoded and deciphered freedom is exhausting

i had a dream about you you were lost in a daydream when i walked in and you began screaming but i know that could never actually happen in real life i only enter people’s nightmares

a beautiful thing happens when we start paying attention to each other it is by participating more in your relationship that you breathe life into it

i dont deserve you im not made for relationships i know im going to fuck this up im going to drive you away or do something to hurt you and youll be added to my list of people i screwed over you should walk away now

solid character will reflect itself in consistent behavior while poor character will seek to hide behind deceptive words and actions

she never got a chance to fall out of love to do it properly slowly and thoroughly and the result was he was like a phantom limb gone but still there and like a true phantom limb the preponderance of feelings associated with him were painful

every broken heart has screamed at one time or another why cant you see who i truly am

it was completely fifth garde and completely silly and i loved it because he wasnt afraid to be silly it was like kissing him first  i could do whatever i wanted and not have to worry what hed think of me

alls fair in love and war said ron brightly and this is a bit of both

marriage happens as with cages the birds without despair to get in and those within despair of getting out

love is something you do for someone else not something you do for yourself

i have never bought into the idea that blood is thicker than water love and respect are meant to be earned from our children our spouses our families and our friends

prince or commoner tenor or bass

painter or plumber or neverdowell

do me a favor and shut your face

poets alone should kiss and tell

a family can be the bane of ones existence a family can also be most of the meaning of ones existence i dont know whether my family is bane or meaning but they have surely gone away and left a large hole in my heart

she wildly burned for the one she loved and he stood there watching hoping he too would catch a blaze from the violence stirring in her heart

maybe love was meant to save us from ourselves

everyday it gets easier to connect with an electronic device that it is to connect with real people

its always hard to remember love  years pass and you say to yourself was i really in love or was i just kidding myself was i really in love or was i just pretending he was the man of my dreams was i really in love or was i just desperate

love falls in love with love

comes like an echo sounding back

searches its mirrored shadow

i had a dream about you last night i could fly i was going to use this power to impress you but you were too heavy to carry so i won you over with my personality instead

love grows from stable relationships shared experience loyalty devotion trust

i despise my own hypersensitiveness which requires so much reassurance it is certainly abnormal to crave so much to be loved and understood

i had a dream about you last night the best day of my life was when i taught you how to juggle but the best day of yours was when you taught someone else

i had a dream about you last night you were playing with chicken livers and told me everyone was in quarantine

he thought about this for a second true but if you never really make friends you probably dont have anyone to be your  am which would kind of suck

i just looked at him as he stirred his soup carrots spinning in the liquid your what

how dare you say its nothing to me

baby youre the only light i ever saw

the girl was grateful to the young man for every bit of flattery she wanted to linger for a moment in its warmth and so she said youre very good at lying

do i look like a liar

you look like you enjoy lying to women said the girl and into her words there crept unawares a touch of the old anxiety because she really did believe that her young man enjoyed lying to women

do not hold your breath for anyone

do not wish your lungs to be still

it may delay the cracks from spreading

but eventually they will

sometimes to keep yourself together

you must allow yourself to leave

even if breaking your own heart

is what it takes to let you breathe

we are one of those couples i used to watch thinking to myself that id never be on the inside of something so special i remember reassuring myself that it probably looked nicer than it actually was i am happy to be wrong about that

in your pursuit of your passions always be young in your relationship with others always be grownup

he is your friend who pushes you nearer to god

oh for gods sake heather said i wish you two would just go out fail miserably as a couple and get it over with

a man can know his father or his son and there might still be nothing between them but loyalty and love and mutual incomprehension

women that can work a camera with ease often work men just as effortlessly for both require the same commitment to vanity and manipulation

if we are to feel the positive feelings of love happiness trust and gratitude we periodically also have to feel anger sadness fear and sorrow

give a man a centimeter and hell think hes a ruler

i love loving you

you are my favorite song a rhythm of beauty that captures my spirit

you are my favorite poem an exquisite grouping of ideas set in motion with an unmatched enchanting elegance

you are my best friend from our laughter to our deep conversations our moments together are a timeless pleasure

you are my soul mate a connection so pure so powerful that it can only be considered divine

you are my lover a passionate entwinement a chorus of ecstasy and a feeling of complete unity that words could never adequately describe

you are my angel you remind me of the goodness in this world and inspire me to be the greatest version of myself

you are my home it is in your loving gaze that i find the comfort acceptance and the sense of belonging

you are my love  mi amor there are not enough days in forever to allow me to fully express my love for you

i love loving you

just because a relationship ends it doesnt mean its not worth having

i need you because i know i deserve you but let me fall in love with you one last time before i let go so i can remember the beautiful imperfection that rattled my bones

my heart is burning a hole in my chest and every time you speak to me it keeps sinking and im left with nothing but ashes i wish she were talking to me because the more she speaks to me the more my heart flutters like a rising phoenix

karen quan and jarod kintz

love spiritually not strategically

she was completely whole

and yet never fully complete

friendships are nice so is competence

its unexpectedly painful to have become a pronoun

shall there be truth between us as two men not as friends but as enemies and equals

lies dont end relationships the truth does

i had a dream about you last night we watched pornography together but purely for the storyline

i had a dream about you last night you were trying to give coordinates to an apple

he doesn’t have to love your cd collection he doesn’t have to love your shoes but any good mature guy better make an attempt to love your friends and family—especially when they’re great

because you let our love just fall apart

you no longer have my heart

but dear don’t be afraid of love it’s only magic

your first impulse is to share good news your second is to club someone with it

because he could not afford to fail he could not afford to trust

that guys sideburns you like him

my back squirms youve asked me that before

what i meant was he says flustered your feelings havent changed since youve been here

it takes a moment to consider the question its not a matter of how i feel i say at last im interested but  i dont know if hes still interested in me

st clair edges closer does he still call

yeah i mean not often but yes

right right well he says blinking theres your answer

the weather of love

has a way of wilting

or blossoming

at the strangest

most unpredictable hour

this is how love is

an uncontrollable beast

in the form of a flower

the sun does not always shine on it

nor does the rain always pour on it

nor should it always get beaten by a storm

love does not always emit the sweetest scents

and sometimes it can sting with its thorns

water it

give it plenty of sunlight

nurture it

and the flower of love will

outlive you

neglect it or keep dissecting it

and its petals will quickly curl up and die

this is how love is

perfection is a delusional vision

so love the person who loves you

and abandon the one

who only loves you

we had been friends we could not become strangers it left only one thing we must be enemies

everyone creates realities based on their own personal beliefs these beliefs are so powerful that they can create expansive or entrapping realities over and overkuan yin

the snag about marriage is it isn´t worth the divorce

please don’t hate you i hate that i love you loving you made me waste a year of my life loving

you made me be passionate about nothing but you loving you made me take risks i never would have

otherwise loving you made me give it up to you loving you made me neglect my parents and amy

loving you made me not care that my grandma just died loving you made me turn out bitter and

hopeless like her loving you made me hate myself for being dumped by you loving you made me

deluded irrational inconsiderate and a liar and because i love you you’re always going to haunt me

love doesnt erase the past but it makes the future different

youre walking funny lucy said a shiteating grin on her face five days of out of this world sex with a starving man could do that to a girl

youre just jealous brenna pushed through the door into darkrivers business hq

lucy made a mournful face yes i am goddamn but your man is hot and he smiles at you ive seen him do it even if no one believes me

winter is much like unrequited love cold and merciless

this is new to us you know your mothers sorry shes sorry that she hurt your feelings and she wants you to invite your girlfriend over for dinner

so that she can make her feel bad and weird

well she is kind of weird isnt she

park didnt have the energy to be angry he sighed and let his head fall back on the chair

his dad kept talking isnt that why you like her

you’re a mess i confess i despise you in the best kind of way

you know your problem quentin you keep expecting people not to be themselves

relationship gurus always said that an attraction based on friendship and mutual respect was far more likely to stay the course  and the bastards were right

there is nothing more beautiful than a vulnerable heart in open hands

but the coconut is also a symbol of resilience samar even in the conditions where theres very little nourishment and even less nurturance it flourishes growing taller than most of the plants around it

we do not have to be mental health professionals to identify the traits of the possible sociopaths among us

why he asked

why what what could i say noah despite you being an asshole or maybe because of it id like to rip off your clothes and have your babies dont tell

evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of any relationship is your responsibility you do not have to passively accept what is brought to you you can choose

dont let a thief into your house three times the first time was enough the second time was a chance the third time means youre stupid

shame isnt a strong enough word for what i feel

you could live a hundred lifetimes and not deserve him you know haymitch says

most people think everybody feels about them much more violently than they actually do they think other peoples opinions of them swing through great arcs of approval or disapproval

on the left side of a strong woman stands a strong man he is strengthened by her character

she couldnt be on his wavelength all the time thats all when you could recognize that and deal with it you were on your way to an adult relationship

they feel life is for the taking and that everyone deserves happiness no matter what the cost i must remember these tricks if i ever decide to have my soul surgically removed

alas woman is faithful as long as she loves but you demand that she be faithful without love and give herself without enjoyment who is cruel then woman or man

scholars theologians and even poets have yet to be able to truly describe and touch upon the beauty romance and magic of a relationship built on  authenticity

hearts set about finding other hearts the moment they are born and between them they weave nets so frightfully strong and tight that you end up bound forever in hopeless knots even to the shadow of a beast you knew and loved long ago

they penguins then fall madly in love and live happily ever after

and so you ask yourself if a penguin can have a worthwhile stimulating relationship why the hell cant i

or maybe you ask yourself would i be happier if i started dating a penguin

surprises i feel now are primarily a form of violence

the aching in my chest

isnt because i miss you

its realizing that you have

become someone i no longer know

your fears your  am thoughts

your achievements

are things i no longer have an equivalent to

who we were and who we are

are four different people

and the me from now

doesnt relate to the me from then

let alone to the you from now

tanzy sayadi and jarod kintz

love me like a wrong turn on a bad road

i love you as the mother of my child the kiss of death

mother of his child demotion i am beginning to see this truism mothers are not always wives i have been stripped of a piece of self

he announces that lately he keeps losing things like your wife and child i want to say but don´t at fourty i´ve learned not to say everything clever not to score every point

i will never claim to know what you are thinking i only hope i am on your mind

a good place to meet a man is at the dry cleaner these men usually have jobs and bathe

death ends a life not a relationship

family friends and relationships are the blessings of the god they are the best way to access god

you could say that elphaba brought us together said boq softly im closer to her and so im closer to you

boq held his breath

but youre little she concluded youre a munchkin for gods sake

he kissed her he kissed her he kissed her little by little by little

do you know how it hurts to touch you

knowing that in the morning i’ll still wake up alone

that’s always seemed so ridiculous to me that people would want to be around someone because they’re pretty it’s like picking your breakfast cereals based on color instead of taste

watching him with one eye she wondered if men ever figured out that they were more appealing when they were pursuing their own work than when they were pursuing a woman

time made me stronger youre no longer on my mind

i have to go i have a finite amount of life left and i dont want to spend it arguing with you

you cant truly hate someone until youve cared about them until youve loved them

the foundation of adult trust is not you will never hurt me it is i trust myself with whatever you do

dont dont lets pretend when theres no one around

still she knows one thing for certain never judge a relationship unless you are the one wrapped up in its arms

youve got an awfully kissable mouth

sure am glad im not royalty i muttered i wouldnt want to have to bump uglies with someone i cant stand on a regular basis and no one else

ow i exclaimed trying to yank my fingers from trent but finding them caught then i colored realizing what id said oh… sorry i stammered meaning it that was insensitive

trents frown turned into a sly smirk bump uglies he said eyes on the table behind me you are a font of gutter slang rachel we must do this again

its as if every conversation with a woman was a test and men always failed it because they always lacked the key to the code and so they never quite understood what the conversation was really about

here was a boy who liked flaws who saw them not as failings but as strengths who knew such a person could exist or what would have happened if wed found each other under different circumstances maybe in a perfect world but not in this one

he needs space and time as if this were physics and not a human relationship

for you she learned to wear a short black slip

and red lipstick

how to order a glass of red wine

and finish it she learned to reach out

as if to touch your arm and then not

touch it changing the subject

didnt you think shed begin or

werent you sorry

to call your best friends

by their schoolboy names

and give them kisses goodbye

to look away when they say

your wife so your confidence grows

she doesnt ask what you want

because she knows

isnt that what you think

when actually she was only waiting

to be told take off your dress

to be stunned and then do this

never rehearsed but perfectly obvious

in one motion up over and gone

the x of her arms crossing and uncrossing

her face flashing away from you in the fabric

so that you couldnt say if she was

appearing or disappearing

alright good night he said his words a little slurred but before i pass out i want you to know that you’re the hottest biscuit this side of the gravy boat

living together is one move closer to living apart

everybody deserves love but nobody is entitled to it

you might think that a boy is just your friend but then if you find out that maybe he likes you in a boyfriend way everything changes instantly

thats one of the first things that comes out of young peoples mouths when theyre in love forever and thats cool its all gooduntil you get old enough to realize what forever is

you will be a great queen when you come back you know and someday youll love me the way you love your wolf

if you havent cried at least once while writing a chapter of your inspirational book then you have to ask yourself if yourre writing fiction

he was everything your mother warned you about when she told you not to walk alone in the dark

relationships are so much like the united states  they only really thrive when faced with an external threat

love and honesty don’t mix

just because you discover that you may like somebody after all it doesnt necessarily mean theres any attraction

i had a dream about you last night you were balancing ten tiny footballs on your nose while dancing with a turquoise unicorn

i had a dream about you last night you kept meowing at people and licking yourself it was not unlike you normally

one of the most difficult things hed ever done was turn away and leave her standing in the shadows

i knew it was over

when tonight you couldnt make the phone ring

when you used to make the sun rise

when trees used to throw themselves

in front of you

to be paper for love letters

that was how i knew i had to do it

swaddle the kids we never had

against januarys cold slice

bundle them in winter

clothes they never needed

so i could drop them off at my moms

even though she lives on the other side of the country

and at this late west coast hour is

her house was lit like a candle

the way homes should be

warm and golden

and home

and the kids ran in

and jumped at the bichon frise

that she never had

they hugged the dog

it wriggled

and the kids were happy

yours and mine

the ones we never had

and my mom was

grand maternal which is to say with style

that only comes when youve seen

enough to know grace

like when to pretend its christmas or

a birthday so

she lit her voice with tiny

lights and pretended

she didnt see me crying

as i drove away

to the hotel connected to the bar

where i ordered the cheapest whisky they had

just because it shares your first name

because they dont make a whisky

and i only thought what i got

was what

i toasted the hangover

inevitable as sun

that used to rise

in your name

i toasted the carnivals

we never went to

and the things you never won

for me

the ferris wheels we never

kissed on and all the dreams

between us

that sat there

like balloons on a carneys board

waiting to explode with passion

but slowly deflated

under the pin

heads down

when it doesnt

after too many cheap

too many sweet

too much

sick like the smell of cheap

like the smell of

the dead

like the cheap dead flowers

you never sent

that i never threw

out of the window

sometimes our walls exist just to see who has the strength to knock

them down

be careful whom you choose to love this decision will impact your future life and happiness in ways you cannot yet imagine

we cant be so desperate for love that we forget where we can always find it within

you know a relationship has deteriorated past the point of salvage when one person detests anothers gestures

it is the same way with dating the time you are most prepared for dating is when you dont need anyone to complete you fulfill you or instill in you a sense of worth or purpose

i loved you at your worst and you were always at your worst nothing could stop me not even you

just start off with the same goals in mind if you have the same values same goals then youll be on track for the same future

life had sure been simpler when i hadnt dated

who does ever get what they want it doesn’t seem to happen to many of us if any at all it’s always two people bumping against each other blindly acting out old ideas and dreams and mistaken understandings

my only complaints are two

that i didnt make myself ready

for you sooner in life that

i cant give you better

love you more

hating hurts the hater the most hating is not a salve for the wounded soul it is an abrasive that keeps the soul wounded and raw and oversensitive

why you are a man of heart

sometimes replied phileas fogg quietly when i have the time

how do you know how best to ensure his nervous breakdown i ask

keep going christian says just go on as if nothing has happened we all hate that

for the first time in his life he understood why the bible called sex knowing everything was different now he knew dante hed known dante and wonder of wonders dante had known him right back

the manlier you are the harder it is to understand what a woman wants there is not a hint of female brain in you

i am looking for the one i can’t fool

and you cant have two stars in one relationship somebody has to be willing to be the wagonat lease some of the time

i would be consumed by you she said and blinked her eyes furiously when she felt them fill with tears you would sap all the energy and all the joy from me you would put out all the fire of my vitality

give me a chance to fan the flames of that fire he said and to nurture your joy

insanity is everyone expecting you not to fall apart when you find out everything you believed in was a lie

the only real battle in life is between hanging on and letting go

dont be a fool dont give up something important to hold onto someone who cant even say they love you

shed never thought any of that would apply to her and jace what they had wasnt ordinary or subject to the ordinary rules of relationships and breakups they belonged to each other totally and always will and that was that

but maybe everyone felt that way until the moment they realized they were just like everyone else and everyone theyd thought was real shattered apart

once you embrace your value talents and strengths it neutralizes when others think less of you

to gaze into another persons face is to do two things to recognise their humanity and to assert your own

i suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears and we marry him

then i imagined a lifetime of having to cry to get him to be kind and i went back to no again

it seemed that we loved each other better when there were large swaths of two continents between us the daily work of love was often hard to perform at home

everyone has their first date and the object is to hide your flaws and then youre in a relationship and its all about hiding your disappointment and then once youre married its about hiding your sins

why then did i always feel as if his happiness was my responsibility it wasnt fair for him to burden me with that it had never been fair

you had to keep the blade up however and rewrap the hilt from time to time and doublecheck the weight

funnyall of that was well duh when it came to weapons why hadnt it dawned on him that matings were the same

from the thoughts of vishous

no i am never setting foot in this house again it scares me and makes me sad and i wish you could be a mom whose eyes worked but i dont think you can

and since i’m marrying into the quartet i have certain privileges and duties if you’re sleeping with laurel—

i’m not sleeping with laurel we’re dating

right and the two of you are just going to hold hands admire the moon and sing camp songs

for a while minus the singing

the best babysitters of course are the baby’s grandparents you feel completely comfortable entrusting your baby to them for long periods which is why most grandparents flee to florida

tina leans forward and asks quietly do you you know love her

squeezing nat’s knee again i reply she’s teachin’ me how

forgiveness is created by the restitution of the abuser of the wrongdoer it is not something to be squeeeeeezed out of the victim in a further act of consciencecorrupting abuse

whats the difference you ask me

the difference is a smile touches my lips

when i remember both the memory of you entering my life

and the memory of you leaving my life

maybe thats what love is having someone who guides you through different experiences coaxes you to try news things but still makes you feel safe

sometimes if she simply remained quiet and let the inadequacy of his excuses reverberate on the air he became ashamed and backtracked

never play cards with a man called doc never eat at a place called moms never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than your own

god is great and god is good lisa says but where are the apache attack helicopters when you need them

do you like him much

i told you i like him a little where is the use of caring for him so very much he is full of faults

is he

all boys are

more than girls

very likely wise people say it is folly to think anyboy perfect and as to likes and diskiles we should be friendly to all and worship none

our happiness is completely and utterly intertwined with other people family and friends and neighbors and the woman you hardly notice who cleans your office happiness is not a noun or verb its a conjunction connective tissue

unless i understand the cross i cannot understand why my commitment to what is right must be precedence over what i prefer

i barely know him i guess that is every relationship you start with nothing and maybe end with everything

i was flipping channels watching this cheerleading program on mtv they took a field hockey girl and transformed her into a cheerleader by the end of the show i was just wondering what if she liked field hockey better

you want the fairy tale

i want a chance at it

even if toxic people are right about what is good they are wrong if the approach is not healthy

i used to want you so bad im so through with that because honestly you turned out to be the best thing i never had

i loved you because there was no other place for me to go we were married because we did not know what else to do with each other you never knew me nothing about me what died inside me what lived invisibly

you lose yourself erica because with the right person who you become together is something so much greater more than you could even realize right now

in the realm of love and sex it’s girls who are in the position of working hard to adapt themselves to the needs and fantasies of the mercurial males whose approval and attention they seek

marriage a hopeful generous infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don’t know yet who they are or who the other might be binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully omitted to investigate

if somebody never gets enough of you they will always want more

i wanted to have a good relationship one thats romantic and dramatic like in the movies but i finally became a woman at  and learned that men arent really that simple

isnt everyone a part of everyone else

better not to invent her in her absence better to wait until shes actually here then he can make her up as she goes along

the best defense is a confusing offense

as i saw it

all my mothers life my father

held her down like

lead strapped to her ankles

she was

buoyant by nature

she wanted to travel

go to the theater go to museums

what he wanted

was to lie on the couch

with the times

over his face

so that death when it came

wouldnt seem a significant change

i didnt dream about you last night i woke up in fear

only love that continues to flow in the face of anger blame and indifference can be called love all else is simply a transaction

i had a dream about you last night we stopped telling each other about our dreams when we realized we were still inside them

god is even in a single parent household

if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide

by selfexample mayst thou be denied

there is something beautiful about watching two people lovingly act silly together behaving as though no one else existed

our lives were now worlds apart separated by time circumstance and the unbridgeable chasm of money

everything else has vanished so you take them now maybe if youre the one keeping them ill be the one feeling better

lovers are not snails they dont have to protrude from their shells and meet each other halfway meet me within your own self

you cannot connect with anyone except through reality

it is with the soul that we grasp the essence of another human being not with the mind nor even with the heart

when we replace a sense of service and gratitude with a sense of entitlement and expectation we quickly see the demise of our relationships society and economy

i believe that it is impossible for two individuals not committed to their own and each other’s well being to sustain a healthy and enduring relationship

she needed the chaos within her in order to discover the extraordinary no man could ever reach

and when all your faith is gone let it be me if its a friend you need let it be me

a break up is the closest thing to bereavement

there was a tacit understanding between them that liquor helped growing more miserable with every glass one hoped for the moment of relief

you never know whos waiting for you and you never know when love is coming your way or who it might be but let me just say a healthy relationship requires sacrifice and dedication

take me now god i shout to the inky sky i´m ready

you´re not ready you´re not even divorced yet bunny says you cannot die married to that man

it was a bitter moment for us we werent two mature parents we were just two kids playing grownup we still needed mommy and daddys permission blessings and money to survive

i wish i hadnt i wish id fought for you i was weak and stupid

there is nothing right or wrong in love where there is love then there is nothing but only love

aint no drama like bedroom drama

hereafter she is only my sister in name not because i disown her but because she has disowned me

failed relationships can be described as so much wasted makeup

why provide relationship benefits to someone who claims they dont want a relationship

i guess it can’t be too often that two people can laugh and make love too make love because they are laughing laugh because they’re making love the love and the laughter come from the same place but not many people go there

disagreement is not necessarily a reason to head for splitsville in fact a relationship without disagreement is probably too brittle to last some of the best human bonds are forged in the fire of disagreement

too many doubts grow in the cracks of silence and separation

in marriage each partner is to be an encourager rather than a critic a forgiver rather than a collector of hurts an enabler rather than a reformer

i dont want you to be young and beautiful i only want one thing i want you to be kindhearted  and not just towards cats and dogs

love is not the perfect match love is the connection between two people

a balanced inner calmness radiates from a peaceful centre it neither craves others approval nor rejects others presence it neither pulls towards nor pushes away it has a reverent attitude towards life and all its inhabitants

theres nothing more efficient than honesty and nothing more powerful than vulnerability because vulnerability reveals everyone in your life who will abuse power immediately and almost irrevocably

an honorable human relationship – that is one in which two people have the right to use the word love – is a process delicate violent often terrifying to both persons involved a process of refining the truths they can tell each other

it is important to do this because it breaks down human selfdelusion and isolation

it is important to do this because in doing so we do justice to our own complexity

it is important to do this because we can count on so few people to go that hard way with us

give a girl a boyfriend and she becomes a total expert on relationships

i dont even know her yetbut if she could see me right now id want her to know that i love her

two people with mental issues in a relationship does not work its like sitting in a boat and neither one has an oar to row the other to shore you can meet your mirror image in life but that doesnt mean you should marry him

from someone who doesnt want to share your destiny you should neither accept a cigarette

when a girl uses six derogatory adjectives in her attempt to paint the portrait of the loved one it means something one may indicate a merely temporary tiff six is big stuff

its dark and i’m reading my scars because our moments remind me of where i should be

it is the mind which creates the world around us and even though we stand side by side in the same meadow my eyes will never see what is beheld by yours my heart will never stir to the emotions with which yours is touched

understand the nature and influence of repeating patterns from childhood experiences or even from past lives wthout understanding patterns tend to repeat unnecessarily damaging the relationship

just remember that the only question in a house is who is to rule the rest is only dancing around that trying not to look it in the eye

love is beyond reason love is not measurable in words love cannot be partial it cannot have owners love is essentially beyond definition or concept

undeniable chemistry and horrific timing they love each other

mismatches destroy us all even the most tender ones and most never have the courage to break someone elses heart to follow their own

in relationships there are no beginning and no end

i had a dream about you last night you were there

if i have to catch a man to get a husband i dont want one

better guilt than the terrible burden of freedom and responsibility

you arent alive if you arent in need

sacrifices made for love are fine unless the sacrifice is you

young love is so ridiculous as is middleaged and old love and it’s also hilarious when have you ever felt so vulnerable and wonderful and terrible at the same time

connecting with someone is not necessarily a bond with a significant other or even a friend but can be the indefinable  perhaps the rarest and most precious thing in life to find at all

the best relationships are between two people who care more about each others good than their own momentary pleasure

just because lips have met doesnt mean hearts have joined and just because two bodies are drawn to each other doesnt mean two people are right for each other a physical relationship does not equal love

i had a dream about you last night we were plug sockets in the bedroom we saw only a short part of their day but we knew everything of it

a wedding is and event but marriage is a life

a pure heart is superlatively rare and even more attractive

look for the heart in a man before you look at what he has

when a man has seen the woman whom he would have chosen if he had intended to marry speedily his remaining a bachelor will usually depend on her resolution rather than on his

its always seemed to me that flirtation is a mans device for avoiding responsibility he can say whatever he wants and knows he wont be taken seriously

its not other people that hurt us but what we feel about them

novan bassists are very good with their fingers

novan and some of us sing backup vocals so that means were good with our mouths too

im chat with novan chang  bassist

youre only responsible for being honest not for someone elses reaction to your honesty

when you walk a life of honesty you live a life of truth

theres something i have to say i said seriously looking her in the eye

she smiled oookay she was mocking memocking my tonebut i didnt care

alley stared at me

and im sorry that i did it again with the chloe thing which was stupid like really really stupid and i

can you just stop for a second ally said holding up a hand

what i said

can you say the first part again she asked rolling her fingers around for a rewind

i racked my brain

umi love you i said

thats the part cuz i love you too

i dont talk with everybody because i am not everybody i am single

it is in our relations with other people that we gain a sense of ourselves its that pretty much that makes relations with other people unbearable

faithfulness in small things leads to faithfulness in great things and never the other way around

women were excited after sex wired becasue in their minds the relationship was on beginning men went to sleep m the because for the orgasm had arrived and the relationship was done

i spend the rest of the afternoon trying to explain to zoe one of the very saddest notions in love and life sometimes the timing is wrongand sometimes you realize the heart of the matter way to late in the game

there is no formula to relationships they have to be negotiated in loving ways with room for both parties what they want and what they need what they can do and what their life is like

for someone who is supposed to be a knight in shining armor youre acting like an ass in aluminum foil

i think she cared more for that bloody dog than for me for us and maybe thats not so stupid looking back maybe it is easier living on your own looking after some stupid mutt than sharing your life with other actual human beings

emotions don’t interfere in my acting nor in my life

i realize the thing about a guy youve spent your whole life loving from afar is that even though hes real youve really made most of him up

i had a dream about you last night you thought you were a candy vampire you were standing in the sun screaming im melting

i had a dream about you last night i was a brick and you were a blanket damn that improbability drive

love doesnt make the world go round love is what makes the ride worthwhile

each piece of glass is another piece of myself i gave to him

its too bad i didnt keep any pieces for myself

people are meant to go through life two by two ’tain’t natural to be lonesome

i celebrate it and relish the electricity of it with every fibre of my being

i can see no better reason for being alive

there remained a strange formality between them and her pleasure in his presence felt too much like missing him had felt during the last week

a woman may be beautiful but have poor character a man may be a business genius making money left and right but lack common courtesy sensitivity and compassion

i love you he said his voice catching when i thought you were going to die i wanted to die

a plan b life can be just as good or better than a plan a life you just have to let go of that first dream and realize that god has already written the first chapter of the new life that awaits you all you have to do is start reading

i always watch you you consume my every thought

if the sound of happy children is grating on your ears i dont think its the children who need to be adjusted

at the end of the day i went to this place where your memories left footsteps on my skin and the breath of your touch stained my desire yea it was one of those nights where i needed you the most

there are only two ways to live your life one as if all that matters is to have someone love and accept you the other is as though loving and accepting another person is all that matters often when you choose the second you get the first

no i dont think i could fall in love with him handsome though he is because i dont accept any of that huff he gives me about my great beauty and all that id have to trust a mans words before i could love him i think

you wouldnt believe that so much could change just because a relationship ended

the day he moved out was terrible –

that evening she went through hell

his absence wasn’t a problem

but the corkscrew had gone as well

it’s the people we hardly know and not our closest friends who will improve our lives most dramatically

among the many answers i have found i believe love is the most beautiful and simple art that reflects the beauty of life

love tames the benumbed beast a man is put to use regarding a womans physical safety but a woman is put to use regarding a mans mental safety

dumped doesnt even begin to describe it if youre going to use a trash metaphor incinerated is more like it

i was going to say the beginning is the good part when its all sparks and sparkles before they are inevitably unmasked as assholes

there is no key to open the heart of another  except curiosity

i had a dream about you last night you turned red then green and then blue you told me you were trying to fit in with the mms

dont show a friend your gift or your bag of money if you still want to maintain your relationship but if nay go on and all youll see is hate and jealousy and youll fight with him in the street like a dog and all youll feel is regret

relationships unlock certain parts of who we are supposed to be

i had a dream about you last night you tried to propose with a digital ceramic heater

i had a dream about you last night you were in the amazon rain forest yipping like a dog

dealing with any man means dealing with multiple personalities

love is supposed to be based on trust and trust on love its something rare and beautiful when people can confide in each other without fearing what the other person will think

with all honesty somewhere between the hello and the dreams i saw you in i fell in love

faith doesnt get you around problems in life and relationships it gets you through it

dont feed your ego with my soul

then we’re just sitting there staring at each other which has been happening a lot lately it’s like

whatever wall there was between us however she was holding herself back from me    all of that

and when you find a soul mate sara says it’s undeniable you have to be together

that’s my philosophy i look back at her you have to go with the flow

exactly i think the universe guides you to make the right choices

do you believe in fate

i guess but    it’s more about creating the life you want so you can make that fate a reality you

she wasnt broken she was just bent over the chance of being ignored by the one she loved

at your absolute best you still wont be good enough for the wrong person at your worst youll still be worth it to the right person

people dont get to our ages without having pasts im more interested in the future

wearing a condom is like eating an icecream cone with a sock on your tongue

but some relationships arent meant to last

they are worthy only till the time the two persons involved have time for each other

they do not know eternity they live for the present the now and when distance plays it part or life turns out to be busy they fall apart

and may be thats why theyre never termed love they simply remain what they were  mere relationships

all the black leather

she needs

is the ez boy recliner

where her love is parked

with one of his hands wrapped around a remote

the other a bottle of beer

shes right its kinky

the way he doesnt look away

from the tv

as her head bobs

like a fishermans float

with the pace

his breath sets

his crotch swells

under her mouths

prowess hes such

he waits

until the

to come

she seemed to think that one of the perks of marriage was that it gave you rights of comment and intrusion over single peoples love lives

i had a dream about you last night we went to the store cupboard to make out but we ended up sharing our pain and then crying together we wasnt prepared for this level of intimacy

proclaim your pride and bitterness loudly to the world but to me speak softly and tell me simply that she doesnt love you

you do not have too many boogeymen for me you have just the right number

frida kahlo to marty mcconnell

leaving is not enough you must

stay gone train your heart

like a dog change the locks

even on the house he’s never

visited you lucky lucky girl

you have an apartment

just your size a bathtub

full of tea a heart the size

of arizona but not nearly

so arid don’t wish away

your cracked past your

crooked toes your problems

are papier mache puppets

you made or bought because the vendor

at the market was so compelling you just

had to have them you had to have him

and you did and now you pull down

the bridge between your houses

you make him call before

he visits you take a lover

for granted you take

a lover who looks at you

like maybe you are magic make

the first bottle you consume

in this place a relic place it

on whatever altar you fashion

with a knife and five cranberries

don’t lose too much weight

stupid girls are always trying

to disappear as revenge and you

are not stupid you loved a man

with more hands than a parade

of beggars and here you stand heart

heart leaking something so strong

they can smell it in the street

there is such a shelter in each other

i had a dream about you last night unfortunately it wasnt a dream

i had a dream about you last night you kept screaming at ted danson to pour you a drink

i had a dream about you last night well i say dream i mean nightmare you were a yankee fan

i had a dream about you you were being hung i had a sword in one hand and a stool in the other i couldn’t decide which one to use so i stood on the stool and threw myself on the sword it was the least i could do to protest capital punishment

the greatest love stories are not those in which love is only spoken but those in which it is acted upon

when you can’t reach the standards of another’s heart you must ask yourself

what value do i put on my soul that i would subject myself to such rejection

when a man plays with your heart it is for one of two reasons he knows he can or he is undecided

first of all never buy a man a plasma tv until youre married a lot of men once they have a plasma tv they dont need a girlfriend

if you do not respect your own wishes no one else will you will simply attract people who disrespect you as much as you do

that was the day that i promised id never sing of love that does not exist but darling you are the only exception

you can only trust your emotions as you can lie to yourself with your brain but not your heart

if i knew how a lot of my relationships would have turned out i never would have gotten involved in them and i would have missed out on some of the best times in my life

some people are oil and water

bones i sighed know something i’m not afraid of you but you scare

me… his outline blurred again

you scare me too kitten he might have replied but i couldn’t be sure

it gets to be a habit most of us manage to keep our body count quite low its the neighborly way to live

suddenly i remembered that laugh it told a different story our story

just because he likes the same bizzaro crap as you doesnt mean hes your soul mate

there is a souljealousy that can be as frantic as any bodyjealousy

every time you mistreat someone you reveal the part of you that lacks love and needs to heal

parker she believed absolutely that each person each heart had a counterpart—had a mate a rightness she’d always believed it and understood that unshakable belief was a reason she was good at what she did

i decided that giving a girl a ring when youre not in a serious relationship is sort of like giving a guy a blow job when you have no real feelings for him it makes everything feel a little cheapit cheapens the giver and the recipient

how can i grieve what is still in motion i ask her shoes are still dropping all over the place i´m not kidding i say it´s normandy out there

she realized when relationships failed to last it was not because love was no longer present but because people had stopped believing in themselves and in their partners

the palate of the hate departs

if any would avenge

let him be quick  the viand flits

it is a faded meat

anger as soon as fed is dead

tis starving makes it fat

a horrible end is better than endless horror

he had known so much about her once what she thought how she felt the reasons for her actions and now he only knew that he loved her and all the other knowledge seemed passing from him just as he needed it most

when all one person do is complain people dont want to talk or listen to them

to make him important in one’s life requires an overactive imagination unfortunately mine never knows when to quit

i had a dream about you we couldnt decide on a sunrise you wanted a tan i only cared about the view then world war iii fulfilled both our desires

every configuration of people is an entirely new universe unto itself

i missed you so much she breathed

i tilted my head back and put my hands on her shoulders i could hardly believe this was happening i was finally getting to touch her to kiss her it was all happening i missed you too

you never walk alone even the devil is the lord of flies

i know you think im crazy maybe thats because i am about life about this moment about you

lovers do things together they rent videos they ride ferris wheels they go out for pizza they play scrabble they    they talk

talk he lifted his head and frowned his eyes puzzled we talk all the time raine ive never had such talkative sex

thats just it she wiggled flailed but couldnt budge him two minutes alone with you and im flat on my back every single time

a slow knowing grin spread over his face is this your way of telling me you want to be on top

too often in my life love has been defined as humiliation with occasional roses

all human males were as fascinated with cars as they were with breasts

the important people in our lives leave imprints they may die or go in the physical realm but they are always there in your heart because they helped form your heart

the fights are always the same

maybe what this is what we have is something that will save us from ourselves

the protagonist amanda discusses her sex relationship with her husband john paul

a relationship needs constant attention it’s a living thing not just a habit you’ve got to keep on top of it

every broken heart has screamed at one time or another i want to know why

we are lovable

even if the most important person in your world rejects you you are still real and you are still okay

this is where men and women are different we can put aside petty competition for relationships  they cant it interferes

to save face its better not to ask sex from the ex but to give everything the axe

the greater the gap between self perception and reality the more aggression is unleashed on those who point out the discrepancy

i could now see her the way she actually is and not in the distorted way my mind presented her to me when i was trying to find a reason to reject her and move on

if she does not respect you she will replace you

ive decided that there isnt much difference in the way we treat our siblings and the way we treat our special someones but at the end of it all we know our siblings have to forgive usor theyll never be able to borrow our car

she was very beautiful and he felt he loved her she was not beautiful as a state or a picture is beautiful she was beautiful as a meadow across which the wind blows it was life that pulsed in her and that had formed her into what she was

i had a dream about you you suggested to split the profits so i did i threw one half in the furnace to power the steam engine and the other half in the air to distract our pursuers

this is what our love is––a sacred pattern of unbroken unity sewn flawlessly invisible inside all other images thoughts smells and sounds

no people find each other more absurd than lovers

even before we met and long after were both gone my heart lives inside of yours im forever and ever in love with you

i am replete with stamina in finding out every single fact i can about this whole affair

it took hours to turn the clock back  seconds

it made me realize how i needed to stop punishing her for something she couldnt help  because sometimes things happen to people and theyre not equipped to deal with them

so i put up with bad behavior in the name of loving the way i thought you were supposed to love

it seemed that everyone else could mate could fit their parts together in pleasant and productive ways but that some almost indistinguishable difference in my anatomy and psyche set me slightly yet irrevocably apart

this is what it is to love an artist the moon is always rising above your house the houses of your neighbors look dull and lacking in moonlight but he is always going away from you inside his head there is always something more beautiful

… she gave me a look that deftly combined tenderness with revulsion to this day the memory of that look still visits me like a jehovah’s witness uninvited and tireless

maybe if you cant get someone out of your head they were never meant to leave perhaps they were meant to help change you into the person you have been waiting to become

they ought to find out how to vaccinate for love like smallpox

close cycles not because of pride or arrogance but because that no longer fits your life

his arms wrapped around my waist from behind and he kissed my neck again closer to the wound this time my pulse accelerated i wanted him to bite me i wanted to be his

nodding parker ate he’s an exceptional kisser

he really is he    how do you know when parker just smiled emma’s jaw dropped you you and jack when how

i think it’s disgusting mac muttered yet another best pal moving on my imaginary ex

if you dont feel the same way about him if youre just leading him on you need to tell him that ive seen too many nice guys get shafted because a girl cant get over some jerk

why she asked in a confused whisper out of all the women in the world why did you choose this mortal

because fate drove me to you

it sometimes seemed to him that for love to work it had to be fair that he should tell only half the joke and she the other half otherwise it would not be love but something completely else–pity or entertainment or standup comedy

we can help pave the roads of those around us but we cant choose their direction

i wear a necklace of hope with pearly beads when i met you it broke and the beads spilled all over the floor into the gutters

i had a dream about you last night

we moved into a cabin in the countryside

i couldnt handle the spiders

you couldnt handle my drama

i moved back to the city

i had a dream about you last night it wasnt until after you sold me the talking car i realized you were the world’s best ventriloquist

every relationship that has hit a crossroads has asked what is it that you want from me

how could you do that to me i repeat i don´t have to itemize he knows what i speak of

eventually n produces three answers in this order

because i am a complete rotter i silently agree but it´s a copout i have maggots therefore i am dead

i was stressed at work and unhappy and we were always fightingand you know i was just crazy

i cut him off saying you don´t get to be crazy you did exactly what you chose to do

which is true he did it is what he has always done he therefore seems slightly puzzled at the need for further diagnosis which may explain his third response

i don´t know

this i feel instinctively is the correct answer how can i stay angry with him for being what he is i was after all his wife and i chose him no coincidences that´s what freud said none ever

i wipe my eyes on my sleeve and walk toward the truck saying to his general direction fine at least now i know you don´t know

i stop and turn around and fire one more question a bullet demanding attention in the moment it enters the skin and spreads outward an important bullet that must be acknowledged

what did you feel

after a lengthy pause he answers i felt nothing

and that i realize too late was not the whole truth but was a valid part of the truth

oh and welcome to the serengeti that too

the toxic behaviors were there before you decided to enter into relationships with them the signs were there you may have chosen to look the other way but the signs were there—psychotherapist from type  sociopath

yes thank you and say hello to judas iscariot

unfortunately he still hadn’t asked for my number or a date or my hand in marriage and my drink was getting low

somewhere underneath it all i know he doesnt deserve to take up space in my brain

because thats what unfaithfulness is isnt it a cancer thats always there in the back of your mind eating away at the foundations of the relationship

i kept loving and loving and loving every waking hour i marveled on how these moments would make made me feel i wanted to love the world and be the change it so deliciously craved

it’s funny how many ways there are to hurt people as many ways to hurt as there are species of flower whole bouquets of hurt

we might have coupled

in the bedridden monopoly of a moment

or broken flesh with one another

at the profane communion table

where wine is spilld on promiscuous lips

we might have given birth to a butterfly

with the dailynews

printed in blood on its wings

i had a dream about you last night eons ago we created a universe then sat back and watched miniature versions of ourselves try to make all the same mistakes we did

we returned to the hotel and had intercourse i like that word intercourse it poses only a limited range of possibilities

i didn’t answer we were not buddies we could not chat about the proximity of our offices or football or forgiveness

use the darkness of your past to propel you to a brighter future

i’ve loved him since i’ve known him mrs daniels he just finally stopped fighting

men want a girl who looks like a boy they want to protect her but she must be a survivor and she must comelike a trainbut withelegance

i had a dream about you last night you replaced all the people in your life with kittens it felt more like a prediction of the future

its the opposite of the collapse of the fantasy

its what happens when the illusion pales in comparison to the truth im seeing her for the first time not ava garden wilder the ragstoriches granddaughter of clyde jones not a tragic romantic heroine

just ava

and i am utterly in love

young girls often feel strong courageous highly creative and powerful until they begin to receive undermining sexist messages that encourage them to conform to conventional notions of femininity to conform they have to give up power

i had a dream about you last night you sat in a cardboard box and said you were a tree

i had a dream about you last night you were crying over spilt ink screaming the words the what could have been beautiful words

the girls burst out laughing

frankie slapped it without a single spark

my life was dark torture and empty before you found me you brought the light red i love you

our actions are guaranteed to affect others because we are not alone in this world much of our learning about ourselves comes from our interaction with others our relationships are our teachers we learn from each other

but everything i have to give ill give to you

the person who wants out of the relationship always gets her way

i just wouldn’t want to hook up with a guy unless i really really like him and in my

experience all boys can be classified as either assholes or bores unless they’re both

maybe it’s a blessing because the last thing i need is relationship drama to sidetrack me from my grades

love doesnt always curl your toes sometimes it takes a bite right out of your soul

because a quiet night is not the same as a silent one a firm man is not the same as a steady one and a bright light is not the same as a brilliant one

real relationships  the kind that were supposed to last but never did  were more trouble than they were worth

fletcher was always going to be your exboyfriend from the moment you met him hes just finally caught up with where hes supposed to be

broken hearts you can run you can hide and perhaps the earth is big enough to believe you’re safe so maybe for a moment you have escaped but hear me hear me well love will find you and it will leave nothing behind

the greatest adventure is to have no fear for the blaze that lies ahead

there is a correlation between the number of days since a man last had sex and the number of things that he is willing to do for a woman

it is assured that men of all ages imagine a woman naked when they first meet

he opened his mouth to say that she looked extremely beautiful and deserved armfuls of roses but the words were lost in committee somewhere shuffled aside by the parts of his head that worked fulltime at avoiding ridicule

and here i was assuming you didnt care about her

stabbing his fingers through his hair he groaned i dont

im always looking for meaningful onenight stands

north is a powerful man and youre still connected to him flo frowned probably sexual memory those capricorns are insatiable well you know sea goat and of course youre a fish youll end up back in bed with him

then whenever i feel the sun on my face i will think of you  i told him you will always be with me bill because of all i have felt for you and all i have learned from you

you know it’s a bad sign when the theme song from titanic describes your relationship

a man to whom a woman cannot look up she cannot love yet it is marvelous how a woman contrives to find something to look up to in a man

but the fact was i suppose there were powerful tides tugging us apart by then and it only needed something like that to finish the task if we’d understood that back then—who knows—maybe we’d have kept a tighter hold of one another

as i walked inside she turned around and headed for the end of the bed then she paused and turned to face me she was wearing her orchard hill basketball tshirt and sweatpants and she looked tired but beautiful

she understands suddenly that the stuff that fills her up is not the love or attention she might get from other people it is the love she herself has for other people we are portia decides the people we love

ah sweetie if the poets couldn’t unriddle them then you certainly can’t be kind and keep your ears on offer if she wants to talk but you can’t draw out the strangeness edgar it’s not a poison

uses religious guilt to control you while they are doing unreligious things

doesnt believe their actions have long lasting repercussions that could affect other people negatively

reminds you of your faults but justifies their own

they humiliate you online and in their inner circle they let their friends family and world know your transgressions

they tell you no marriage is perfect and you are not trying yet they are the one that has stirred up more drama through their insecurities

they say they are sorry but they don’t show proof through restoring what they have done

they don’t make you a better person because you are miserable they have only made you a victim or a bitter survivor because of their need for control over you

their version of success comes at the cost of stepping on others

they make your marriage a public event in order for you to prove your love online for them

they lie but their lies are often justified

you constantly have to start over and over and over with them as if a connection could be grown and love restored through a honeymoon phase or constant parental supervision of one another’s down falls

they brought you to a point of improvement but no longer have your respect

they dont make you feel anything but regret you know in your heart you settled

real relationships are the product of time spent which is why so many of us have so few of them

not every marital union is going to be a meaningful and fulfilling experience

most of marriages today are nothing more than poorly or well managed coexistence

bravery is the choice to show up and listen to another person be it a loved one or perceived foe even when it is uncomfortable painful or the last thing you want to do

is disinterest not the essence of every human relationship

the thing women tell you what they want but secretly they really want you to tell them why you don’t want them again so they can try one last time to convince you that you were wrong

the warped mentality that having someone tell you honestly why they don’t want you is going to somehow make you feel peace so you can move on

the neat packaging of finishing conversations because you have been stewing over it insecurely about the length of what a stalker does

the one thing women don’t give themselves because if they didn’t care about the jerk they wouldn’t still be hanging onto another conversation that tells them what they already know he just isn’t that interested in you

the anal retentive art of perfecting every ending with meaning rather than just excepting you went through something rather sucky and he doesn’t care

the act of closing something with someone when in reality you should slam the door

that cake tasted good but the cake in the garbage tasted better it was the best cake i ever ate

i arrived i saw humans and i saw through their faces nothing ever changes but the light in their eyes for i too have buried my demons today without knowing what might remain beneath the face of tomorrow

kate lost a mother i said but i lost a nothing

kate doesnt feel that way jack assured me

but what about everybody else besides kate how can i ever explain to anyone what she was when she and i had no name people need names for everything i wasnt a relative or a friend i was just an object of her kindness

he wiped my cheeks saying ssshh i buried my face in his shoulder

youre the one now jack said definitively thats why you met her she had something she had to pass on p

there is tremendous trauma in the betrayal caused by a perpetual liar as they repeatedly commit psychological abuse

you want him praising the lord in the morning you put a smile on his face tonight

a girl should set her sights on a man who has money or if not who can expect to come into money or if not who has moneyed connections

youre still in it youll always be in it no not literally but in your heart nothing ever ends not if its gone that deep youll always be walking wounded thats the only choice after a while walking wounded or dead dont you agree

excessive praise arises from the same bigotry matrix as excessive criticism

breaking the circle

my eyes darken when i see my new lover fresh prey

my body doesn’t really react in a sexual way

it’s the devil inside me that celebrates next conquest

we exchange meaningless sweet words

his hungry gaze penetrates my breasts and ass

another drink and laughter

and then another one

sometimes i get very drunk or high

and then i don’t feel him between my legs

i don’t see his sweating face

i don’t hear his moans and questions if i came

i can’t stay sober when i cheat on you

i’m such a coward that i can’t even face this inner monster

it consumes me it takes away my dignity

it makes me do horrible things

it hurts you the only one who ever loved me

who knows what i really am

no it’s not the monster it’s me i am the whore

i dig my nails into your soft flesh until it bleeds

i am the one pushing you away feasting on your kindness

i blame those hard punches of my past for my infidelity

those cruel hands those hateful words

i try not to i really do

i try to be a better person

but how can i if i am just nobody

you know why i leave yet you stay you’re there when i’m back

with your sorrow and cry and resentment and wrath

why

if i’m broken because of my pain what’s your excuse

why do you keep letting me treat you like a stray dog

don’t you have any respect for yourself

what the fuck is wrong with you

and just when i think i have my own slave for life you break the circle

you shut the door with a grimace of relief

you can’t look at me anymore

see you’re finally free

my inner innocent girl is happy for you

but the monster inside kicks and laughs at me

i’m left alone

i dress up and go hunting

peter if you dont share the lows it seems you might stop sharing the highs as well

robots are like mars they need

boys wont do

the memesoup is all wrong they stomp

when they should kiss

and theyre none too keen

on having things shoved inside them

its not a robot

until you put a girl inside sometimes

i feel like that

the company forgot to put a girl in

when clouds of pain loom in the sky

when a shadow of sadness flickers by

when a tear finds its way to the eye

when fear keeps the loneliness alive

i try and console my heart

why is it that you cry i ask

this is only what life imparts

these deep silences within

have been handed out to all by time

everyone’s story has a little sorrow

everyone’s share has a little sunshine

no need for water in your eyes

every moment can be a new life

why do you let them pass you by

oh heart why is it that you cry

men are not dogs we merely think we are and on occasion act as if we are but by believing in our nobler nature women have the amazing power to inspire us to live up to it

my god these folks dont know how to love  thats why they love so easily

women rescue men just as much as if not more than men rescue women

if you expect honesty be honest if you expect forgiveness forgive if you expect a whole person you have to be a whole person

it hurts to let go sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away you feel like some kind of criminal for having felt for having wanted for having wanted to be wanted

people have character strength but they lack communication skills and that undoubtedly affects the quality of relationships as well

perhaps the depth of love can be calibrated by the number of different selves that are actively involved in a given relationship

what did we end up hating each other did we end up the way we thought we always knew would did i end up wearing khakis because of that fucking ad

our moments are music and sometimes – just sometimes – we can catch them and put them into some lasting form if we didn’t have music i don’t think we could ever be truly happy and if we didn’t have special moments we would never find music

these guys may not talk too much about relationships but they sure do blush at telling moments don’t they maybe that’s the key to understanding the opposite sex i could invent a science call it blushology

we spend so much time on the whole world instead of on those who really need us in a world where rumours are a trend and truth is an afterthought

i know my vision is impaired and cannot be trusted with even the simplest tasks much less dating not that i´ve come within talon distance of a man

it all comes down to that one person you always think about before you fall asleep at night and text good morning as soon as you wake up

he is not the same person as when we

met but    neither am i time has refined us but instead of pushing us apart we’re closer than ever

never give a lousy person the opportunity to create lousy babies

regardless of whether a relationship brings us joy or sorrow each relationship gives us the opportunity to grow stronger nobler and more compassionate with ourselves and others

an apple tree is just like a person in order to thrive it needs companionship thats similar to it in some ways but quite different than others

love is more about being the right person than finding the right person

when i am lonely for boys what i miss is their bodies the smell of their skin its saltiness the rough whisper of stubble against my cheek the strong firm hands the way they rest on the curve of my back

i´ve blown it the whole grisly charade

you can never recover from losing a person you love but you can find a way to let it be part of your life rather than letting it take over every part of you

your relationships will take you beyond the boundaries of your normal strength encouragement gives struggling people eyes to see the unseen christ

i help others because i can not because i expect something in return

the thing that binds us together is that we have both lowered our expectations of life

relationships are never static they have to evolve over time as the individuals in them change

when women are secret they are secret indeed and more often then not they only begin to be secret with the advent of a second lover

walk together feel the heart beats experience the presence this is how to be thankful

emancipation of women has made them lose their mystery

when a man cheats it is said it is because he is a dog when a woman cheats it is said it is because her man is a dog

how much do you love me

she drew in a breath and let it out too much

too much is just enough for this man

and do you love me she whispered

i have always loved you always you know that

beauty is in the heart of the beholder

its early days a few skeletons are bound to keep jumping out of the closet

all positive interactions with other human beings involve to some degree the experience of visibility that is the experience of being seen and understood

do you know where your breakthrough begins your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends

there is no one so cruel as those closest to you

the moment you put someone on a pedestal they will look down upon you the trick is respecting each other equally

we imagined we knew everything the other thought even when we did not necessarily want to know it but in fact i have come to see we knew not the smallest fraction of what there was to know

pubic hair is proof of sexual maturity and if your partner finds that a turnoff you should probably reconsider that partner

i had a day when i was busy in the world where the activity created a turmoil on the surface of my consciousness like waves on the surface of the ocean which made it difficult to see through the waves to the inner silence

it reminded me that we need to develop both the capacity to use the mind when engaged in activity and social relations and to be able to let go of the activity and to come in contact with the deep inner silence

the relationship between being active in the world and in social relations and the inner silence is like the relationship between the waves on the surface of the ocean and the deep inner silence on the bottom of the ocean

how do people know they are sane can a person be gripped by lunacy only to be released a short time later never to relive the episode again

or maybe i like cuddle raped him or something

the greatest testament of a life lived is to be missed when you are gone it is not something you can plan for or buy ahead of time it is a sentiment that comes freely from the lives you touch in positive ways

you and george didnt go back on your promises

but people change he said quietly

i feel incendiary a wildfire my spirit licks at the gates of a very elaborate customized and distracting emotional hades

playing roles in any relationship is false and will inevitably lead to the relationships collapse noone can be any one thing all the time

you get what you give we will tell his sorry selfish ass the betty lady has spoken i detect a bronx accent

but i demur it will make the other woman say ´see she is a jealous and paranoid and pushy wife´

ostensibly yours my sweet

i see  rather like my life since i met you

sand castles just arent made to last

oh you want me to lie still while you check me out damn red if id have known that earlier i wouldve been horizontal already

you have to shrink yourself to fit into this little life with him

this was one of those moments when i realized that my emotional baggage once a few neatly packed pieces was now like the joads truck stacked high with old clothes half a rocking chair a mule all barely secured with twine

to be honest going out with ed after josh is like moving on to duchy originals supertasty seeded loaf after plastic white bread i dont mean to be rude about josh and i didnt realize it at the time but it is he is plastic white bread

to know other people thought hed made a mistake vindicated me i wasnt a bad girlfriend he was simply going through a period of temporary insanity and hed come to his senses soon

the kiss intimately relates to the most primitive kind of human contact which can satisfy all of our needs like feeding enjoying pleasure tasting wanting rejecting everything we associate with love

for better or for worse but not for lunch

people frequently point to communication as a problem because its easy to notice but usually it is a symptom of an underlying problem with a relationship posture

relationships that are merely based on practicality or utility will ultimately make us feel lonely

it was masturbation not willpower that made it possible for gazillions of women to walk down the aisle with their reputation and their hymen still intact

some women have been faking orgasms for so long that they sometimes fake one when they are masturbating

her husbands departure  had picked mildred up by the hair and dropped her down at the doorstep of insanity

a while back when dick and barry and i agreed that what really matters is what you like not what you are like barry proposed the idea of a questionnaire for prospective partners

i look forward to the day that i can feel nothing but indifference for you just like you were able to do from the moment that you walked away

and she realized everything one does is just another effort to be understood by someone a little bit more

i went back to my room and spent all night contemplating whether it was possible in life not to be constantly let down if it could ever be worth pinning your happiness to another person when all other people ever seemed to do was disappear

your ability to make me feel like i was less than i was took awhile to recover from but after ripping my own self worth to shreds for so long i realized that i wasnt less just because i was more than your inexperienced hands could handle

when we don’t tell those we love about what’s really going on or listen carefully to what they have to say we tend to fill in the blanks with stories

true confidence is not about what you take from someone to restore yourself but what you give back to your critics because they need it more than you do

you wait for about a year

and as soon as one approaches your stop

two or three others appear

you look at them flashing their indicators

offering you a ride

you’re trying to read the destinations

you haven’t much time to decide

if you make a mistake there is no turning back

jump off and you’ll stand there and gaze

you can he urged pulling back and grinding my hips against his heat quickly rushed to my cheeks i have you i found you and i’m not letting you go

they will declare every journey has been taken

you shall respond i have not been to see myself

they will insist everything has been spoken

you shall reply i have not had my say

you shall reply my way is not complete

you are warned any way is long any way is hard

through love tribes have been intermixing colors to reveal a new rainbow world and as more time passes this racial and cultural blending will make it harder for humans to side with one race nation or religion over another

love is being able to view a situation without adding duality to it

your body would not get sick if you held no thought of resentment it is neither good nor bad of itself if we hold anything against anyone we will suffer ourselves

there is the purity of love harmonious in every way but not meant for a lifetime and then there is the steady love of commitment  no less real but completely different she had both

some women marry houses

it was the impatience of the way he tore my panties from my body that really turned me on i was all he could think of as his lust got the better of him

i glanced back and saw the underwear torn and discarded a little strip of thin black material on the floor and thought yes this is the kind of impatient sex i’m looking for

all i know is that the closer i get to god the deeper i get into the bible and the heavier the burden seems on my shoulders

i had a dream about you we were ice fishing in my freezer i caught a few cold beers and you wondered if we should drink them or throw them back because they were babies

relationships should be like glass  no matter who sees from what angel  it should be transparent

you know what shes made of

yeah good stock good breeding a hard head and a hunger to win she flashed him a smile as they approached the kitchen door ive been told that describes me im half irish brian i was born stubborn

schools for love do not exist everyone assumes that we will know how to love instinctively

we have already said more goodbyes than are necessary those were goodbyes that brought about the end of partings we taught each other that no parting is possible

tell them there are no holes for your fingers in the masks of

men tell them how could you ever even hope to love what you cant

more than nakedness

for there is no cover to take

by now the powders were completely mixed together indistinguishable from each other

our best friends the ones we love the most are the ones who can hurt us the most because look she pointed down to the powders

to you what is it that keeps us together

fingertip to fingertip from santa fe

i feel bloated with what i should say

and what i dont we drift and drift with

few storms of heat inbetween the motions

and anesthesia death we are caught between

clouds and wet earth

it is that you like the way i want you and you don’t want that feeling to go to someone else

next time before you decide it is love

first ask yourself

am i safe here

is there room for growth

when i say no does he listen

forgetting friends to lose myself in lovers

remembering them only when love is lost again

knowing that real love does not need convincing but trying anyway

building castles of projections making pedestals out of dreams

the war began after i had placed him on a pedestal

my expectations were only leading me to more disappointments

first i tried to fight it with denial then i tried to fight him with my words

i did everything but accept that he was not the man i thought he was

my heart was longing for you suddenly

and i became short of breath

the kind you took away so long ago

and only gave back what little i have left

you mistake love you think it has to have a future in order to matter but it doesnt its the only thing that does not need to become at all it matters only insofar as it exists here now love doesnt require a future

when we consider our rich inner communities we will find it is quite possible that more than one pattern of attachment can arise at the same time sometimes in support of the others and sometimes in conflict

consistency is the mark of truth

james coan says in truth because so many neural structures are involved in one way or another in attachment behavior it is possible to think of the entire human brain as a neural attachment system

emotional hurts are like cancers of the soul if we don’t get them out they can poison the whole soul and body

if you cant keep it dont wish for it

one may have said this or the other may have thought it but it hung invisibly between them like a spider web between trees

some things between those who are close do not need to be spoken to be understood

who wants to go drinking and fall in love

i must be at the command of the lord not the dictates of people pressures or my own issues

fighting doesn’t feel good anymore it feels like breaking something because you don’t know how to fix it

it’s hard to let go especially after you’ve invested a few years it’s hard to let go of who we imagined someone else was too you loved him so you overlooked all the thing that were obvious to everyone around you we all do it

sometimes when we least expect it love gives us a second chance

if you had a strong chemistry with the person—then it would be difficult to forget them into your life

there was magic some kind of alchemy i dont remember the moment you transformed from a prop into a main character no thats not what happened i dont remember when you shape

for my beloved

as i hold your hands in mine

know that i hold your heart as well

as i gaze into your eyes

know that i see into our shared future

as i feel your heart beat

know that mine dances along to its rhythm

as i hear the words you speak

know that they are melody and harmony playing in my ears

as i sit in amazement that you are in my life

i recognize what a gift you are

we must be compassionate but not enable people to blame or shame us out of god’s blessings

love with abandon without fear of being abandoned

i know you by heart

from the words you whisper in my ear

to the glow in your eyes when you look into mine

from the late night talks we share

to the little things you do to brighten my day

from the way you take care of me when you sense i am in need of a little tlc

to the way you share secrets with me that you have never told another living soul

thank you for letting me into your heart

i love you with all of mine

you can never do for someone what they are not willing to do for themselves

you are not someone’s answer you are an example of what the answer can do in someone’s life and you are compelled to share how you did it by god’s word and his grace but only their yielding in obedience to god is their answer

being able to hold a real live woman in my arms regularly brought me a certain level of calm

find someone who will teach you the variance of doubt comfort and preference and sometimes its your skin and at times its those who embrace it fearlessly

if its meant to be it will happen naturally

people arrived and there was eating drinking dancing and misunderstandings between all the couples married and unmarried frank

we may not be able to make people’s decisions but we can choose to forgive and be made whole in him

you were never created to please people you were created to please god

if you let sharks call the shots control and manipulate you it will lead you down a road of burnout hopelessness and even depression

people may betray you but you don’t need to take it personally

satan wants to use sharks to move you from your purpose don’t let him

we don’t need to be fearful of sharks but we do need to have an awareness of them

god has called us to love people to be an example and to be kind but we have to take courage and be wise because there are sharks out there

everything is sex but sex isnt everything

relationships arent two incomplete halves coming together to make a whole rather its two complete wholes coming together to create something greater than their sum

like a tent she had an open slit and she was sick of men trying to build lamps inside her if a lamp was to be built no one could see the naked wick

even though we know well get hurt by thorns we still go for flowers

it took the city of new york to break them up if thats not romantic the word mustve changed meanings while i wasnt looking

were all a little broken inside

but we can help fix each other

when being in a toxic relationship in life at times you may have to step outside yourself to see yourself so you can find yourself and love yourself again

sometimes love can be a simple thing but a difficult decision between holding on or letting go

this is not a race to get to a closing this is an experience that begins with understanding the needs of every client and developing the individualized steps for each situation

conquering can give you courage

it burns

it burns

now

now that

the story is over

now that

the daybreak is liquid

now that

my knees dont creak anymore

and the leaves are blowing

and the highway is humming

and a few extra pounds is not

it burns

in me too

but the ache is not for you

its for my passion

that used to be your name

and its sad really

the sting of

too little

too late

i came to the conclusion that women are not bad they only learned to play dirty like men and now men learned to be dramatic like women

to be in love with life is to be in touch with our spiritual essence it is to see beauty and loveliness wherever we go it is to see the glow of divinity in all those around us

we must have heart and overcome if we are to thrive in life and not merely survive

if we are living for the approval of others we aren’t living for the approval of god

you only need one approval and that’s god’s

if you have to perform for people’s approval trust me it’s not worth having

trust god and follow his will for your life his love is unconditional

fear and intimidation is the most common and easy shark attack to fall prey to

be bold be courageous god’s grace is backing you

why do we try to look for sharks why do we try to please the sharks that hurt us hold us back and keep us from our destinies

if you allow sharks to dictate your decisions they will try to exert their will on you more and more

the greatest loss is the loss of one’s calling because we were listening to the wrong voices

that sense of inferiority is just another word for fear and fear is simply the selfdeception that you are about to be separated from the thing you most value

the decisions you make every day are either building up or tearing down your life what you meditate on what you think about and how you use your time set the course for your future

you risk failure no matter what you do so why not do what you love

you can always find a reason to hesitate to quit or to delay jumping headfirst into your dreams but you’ll never step into the call on your life until you do

if we live in a place of hurt how can we be effective in our own lives or in impacting others

hurt feelings destroy so many relationships not only that but they can take us off course from our destinies if we let them

we’re all looking for others to make us feel special valued and even exceptional and when others fail to do what we need we get our feelings hurt

the culture is out of control and we can’t afford to fail into their divisive worldly attitudes which lead to rebellious ways

jesus is not a way to truth he is the way

you and i are called to speak truth even when the culture tries to pressure us into silence

we must be careful to say the truth with the least offense but it has to be the truth nonetheless

we must make sure our ways mirror the word of god if we are going to live free and inherit the blessings of god for our lives this is not the hour to compromise to keep from getting our feelings hurt

our goal should be to represent jesus in every situation when i was dealing with sharks i didn’t have the answers but god did

if you keep your eyes on jesus and prioritize your walk with him you’ll build your life on the right foundation

i want to encourage you don’t settle build the dream god has given you

the feeling of obligation can cause you to make bad decisions for your time family and destiny

it’s not always destruction that keeps us from our destiny it’s distraction

sharks will try to steal your time and intention but you have to protect your focus keep your eyes on jesus he will carry you through persecution to victory

we have to fight the battle for our destinies not the battle for approval

we can’t sacrifice the will of god for the approval of people

people will criticize the very thing god has called you to do saying it seems impossible to them or too hard for them but that’s why god called you to do it not them

the difference between world changers and stagnant drifters comes down to the ability to focus on opportunities and then seize them

god can show you where to capture the fish but you have to cast the net

intimidation isn’t pretty it compels you to compare yourself to everything and everyone else

god wants us to get out of the boat get into the water and learn as we go

intimidation keeps your eye on you and conveys that image to others

when a shark has influence in your life it makes you want to stay in the boat

if you get out of the boat you’re going to have to learn how to swim you’re going to have to learn to adapt think new thoughts and learn new skill sets you’re going to have to change and that’s what god wants

boys can break your heart and betray you but not in the same stinging way girls can

sharks don’t eat fish because of anything the fish do they don’t eat fish because those fish aren’t good enough fish or because those fish aren’t nice enough to the sharks sharks eat fish because they are sharks

night eyes had risen and stretched stiffly now he came to lie down beside me he set his head on my knee i dont understand you are ill

no just stupid

ah nothing new there well you havent died from that so far

they knew they must not hope but still they hoped for the reason alone that hope goes with man to the foot of the gallows

if you are looking for a pathway to your dreams that won’t require you to have courage you’ll be looking for the rest of your life

in all seasons of the unknown we have a choice to either be a victim in the tension or enter into a deeper dependency upon god

desire is much like fire it is beautiful and mesmerising but if unguarded can cause great destruction and loss

relationships are all about finding that moment of balance and equilibrium so you don’t fall over in life

unlike a precious diamond whose form luster and beauty never change over decades relationships are altered by the evolution of traversing life

if there’s one thing i’ve learned after a lifetime of facing fears it’s that there’s no reward without some risk

its not the first kiss that matters its the last

your dreams are on the other side of your fears

there are no shortcuts to your destiny just one single choice am i going to jump in the water

it’s time to let go of everything that’s held you back intimidated or discouraged you in the past it’s time to be fearless

if you’re waiting for the perfect opportunity the perfect training or the perfect tools before you step out in obedience to god you’ll be waiting forever

the one thing every successful person has in common is that they started where they were with what they had that’s all they could do and that’s all you can do too

nothing equips you for success like noble failure

we wanted to help people but because we gave so much of an allowance to negative people in our lives we lost sight of the big picture we wasted our time on people who couldn’t be pleased and we felt like we had failed

we were somewhere in between somewhere i could see the light and the dark somewhere i could see the world when all i saw was you

if you always take responsibility for the people who wrong you or don’t like you you will be bound by a spirit of people pleasing and ultimately miss your destiny

great leaders don’t allow failure to redefine their purpose they use failure to refine their purpose

whether you fail or succeed doesn’t alter the identify or purpose god has placed in you

giving up on god’s assignment on your life because of naysayers manipulators fear or setbacks is the biggest mistake we can make

you have to learn how to deal with difficult situations and difficult people they are never going away

you live in sharkinfested waters you can either be afraid and intimidated or you can learn to deal with them

every breath every moment possessed with an illusion of glamor of filthy decadence purely because it was ours we two our own radical world a star collapsing inward and bursting gorgeous in the dark

if one person changes in a relationship the dynamics shift so even if you’re the only person who’s willing to make some changes—for now—that’s enough

a boundary is not a plea demand or rule that your partner must follow or else a boundary is a decision that you make about how you’re going to lead your own life

ask your partner for acceptance not obedience

what if every moment of conflict is a chance to make your relationship even stronger

do you want real intimacy real fulfillment or do you want an emotionally charged relationship that swings up and down over and over

remember as adults we don’t need to always get our way but we do need to feel heard and genuinely considered

were always drawn to the clearest articulation of what we think we lack

while she was away hed forgotten how powerfully she broadcast her feelings filling the house like a kind of nerve gas

when being in a relationship with a great man focus on being an asset to your king and not a liability

there for me im so tired of that phrase where is there

the fate of some women she was beyond gorgeous and damaged as hell why did those two always seem to go together

to love is to open oneself up for vulnerabilities

to love is to open oneself up for uncertainties

never try to make excuses for people sometimes a person might be good but not be good for you

avoiding the truth is the same as telling a lie

starting all over again with your exlover is like watching a new movie on an old blackandwhite tv  nkwachukwu ogbuagu

there are people and things we cherish that others do not themselves that others may even ridicule us for but this is precisely why we must

in nature yin feminine and yang masculine are balanced and equal ust as in nature if society values one over the other it weakens both and creates an unnatural state where harmony is lost and turbulence is created

this is a crisis in our culture because we have stopped raising men and wee are raising p u s i l l a n i m o u s males at epidemic proportions

when being in a relationship focus on being an asset to your significant other and not a liability

theirs was a private language not shared with the rest of the world and so exempt from censure sheer burlesque

there was mystery at the heart of any of marriage secrets even people close to it would never know

i would wack off a lot and hug my pillow imagining my ex

you entered the picture and lit my world with laughter and light and wonder welcome and warm you ran by me a dart of the eyes a quick glance flicking of sweat off your fingertips and i wanted to take a shower wash off dad and bathe in you

so much of what i am he made forged it in me i know that but dad used pain to rid me of pain leaving me empty and hurting you poured in you and filled me up for the first time i felt no pain

you gave me the one thing he never did love absent a stopwatch

to live is to grieve

as parents we have been entrusted with such a precious prize the lives of eternal souls

the art of letting you go hasn’t been a graceful one

i no longer wait for the sea

to whisper your waves back to me

when i miss the good times

i must remember that

no matter how hard i tried

i could never wash the taste

of doubt off my lips

that every flavor of your kiss

hit me with pungent loneliness

even when the touch of your

and that this safe space

i worshiped through my poems

was a product of my imagination

more than your words or actions

there is no such thing as failure in love relationships end but they don’t fail love is only a failure when you don’t learn and you don’t try

you can’t lose what’s real

those who dont matter dont matter those who matter respects you and those who respect you are all that matters

you used to find refuge in me but now you’re swimming against the current of us

my desperation grows more teeth

trying to make you stay

and ripping the sinews of my heart

with the utmost love as our motivation we somethings think we are doing what is best for our children by protecting them from unpleasantness or cruelty all we are really doing is shielding ourselves from owning up to misfortune or bad judgment

c dick helped me discover that i was no longer interested in redefining myself just to please a man and i found out i could end a relationship simply because it wasnt meeting my needs

id love to date someone who is a bit distance away from me someone who is cool loving and respect me

many christian women desire to be happily married to a godly loving husband but what they dont know is holding them back

those who consider people bridges will use them

those who view people as humans will try to befriend them

those who see their partners as persons they can dump are bound to attract dumpsters and doomed they are to attract but the trash bins

i think we fear that if we give ourselves away we are certain to lose ourselves in the giving and i would suggest that you cannot lose yourself in ‘giving yourself away’ rather you lose yourself when you ‘squander’ yourself away

if someone awakens in us a desire wed rather not have we try not to like that person however if that fails we then seek something likeable in him something good enough to make the desire for him less bothersome more endurable

its not worth it to remain in a relationship that has grown too old to make you feel too young at heart  nkwachukwu ogbuagu

unless you have a plan a list of your priorities to do you’re planning to fail

divorcing the act of getting from the act of offering opens up the door to building stronger relationships stronger trust and more respect with the people we serve

and sometimes thats just what happens people grow apart

relationships are tested by distance love is put to the test by closeness

love can lie too

after all the only thing harder than allowing yourself to care is pretending that you dont

i might one day risk falling in love again but i was not going to lose my heart to the cardiologist

i can see now that its the little things the small efforts that keep a relationship going and i know now that too in some small measure i have the power to hurt him and also the power to make it better

sometimes when we feel broken inside we try to look for other things to fix and to fill ourselves to fill our identity and to make ourselves feel good but when youre broken you’ll often be attracted to people who are broken too

social media is a hotbed for insecurities in my practice i’ve actually seen people break up relationships over fights about social media this is kind of a new era of marital and relationship conflict it all comes down to intention

toxic drama has no part in real love lying to protect you is still lying

the love is murdered by lies it cannot be resurrected by excuses

what doesnt kill you makes you stronger and gives you a dark and twisted sense of humor

any relationship which could be ruined by talking about your feelings standards or expectations  wasnt a healthy relationship to begin with darlin

our greatest lesson in this lifetime is to practice opening our hearts even when it hurts

he unrequitedly loved anna anna unrequitedly loved marco marco probably unrequitedly loved some rando none of them had ever met the world was pitiless nobody had any power over anyone else

i cant believe you called me anna said nobody else from home has called me in forever its like they forgot about me you think youre so close to people but when it comes down to it they just forget

anna are you asleep

he imagined anna lying awake eyes wide staring at the ceiling her heart full of yearning but there was only silence

its really easy to be patient and sympathetic with someone when its theoretical or only for a little while its a lot harder to deal with someones craziness when its constant

did he even exist in her mind as a living breathing thinking person he spent so much time trying to figure out what she was thinking but what kind of a consciousness did she imagine lived behind the mask of his face

for the first time ted imagined fucking anna the way he almost fucked rachel cruelly without concern for her comfort fully acknowledging that as much as he loved her he hated her too

and you—you—have to deal with it all measure the puzzle pieces and see if somehow they might fit within the gaps and cracks left by your own experiences

do not be afraid of love or the course it will take there is no certainty in life choose love first and choose love last and it will give you more than you ever give it

it was so easy in high school when all it took was the same taste in music and cool trainers we just took it from there easily naturally like a stroll

going to go on and off like the grand slam anyway

the world was soon coming to a brokenhearted zombie apocalypse with the

all these  yearold women should be married by now i would marry all of them hmm that doesnt sound quite right

the most important relationship throughout your entire life is the one within cherish it

we dont have to stay in a repeating bad story we can pick up a new book which is better and happier just by putting the other book down

relationships are a gift from god one cannot arrange what is not written in heaven both people must feel the spark of god which ignites the love and says come this way i have a good story for you

what i lack in the looks department i make up for in the everything else department

never win at the expense of the relationship

watching you

stare into space in the tidy

rows of the vegetable garden ostensibly

working hard while actually

doing the worst job possible i think

you are a small irritating purple thing

and i would like to see you walk off the face of the earth

because you are all thats wrong with my life

and i need you and i claim you

what is a woman

her brothers sister her fathers daughter

her husbands wife her childrens mother

on my way i was learning was the product of baracks eternal optimism an indication of his eagerness to be home that did nothing to signify when he would actually arrive almost home was not a geolocator but rather a state of mind

you cant support longterm relationships there are times when people are no longer interested in me

you can master relationships only if you are able to differentiate between who is praying for you and who is playing with you

writing poems is the best revenge

being a sugar baby was like being a groupie but for any guy who was rich

death distance and time shall each one of them dig graves for your affections but this you do not know nor can know until the story of your life is ended

be wise and break the silent treatment before it break down your relationship beyond repair pride repels love ask the devil he will tell you

one gets away with a lot when one is in an unchallenging relationship or is too busy to invest in one at all mostly one gets away from oneself

if you want to know how easy it is to love someone without holding back forgive that person genuinely and try loving that person again you will experience love in d and in high definition

if you do not have a forgiving heart stay far away from love otherwise you will spoil the beauty of love

love is not enough you also need hope and faith for your marriage to stand firm

she gives me meals that stick to my ribs she dont forget to put salt in the porridge she never slams doors and when she has nothing to say she dont talk thats uncanny in a woman you know mister

as your walk with christ grows your relationship with your spouse grows

everything i teach now i learned from my relationship with mimi being deeply in relationship changes the world i didn’t know then that my life would pivot to teaching others and to being with many many mimis

she loved harry and so when he disappeared when he withdrew into vagueness and alcohol she had despised him passionately

relationships that help us change negative characteristics are relationships worth building and maintaining for life because the other person is looking out for our best interests and wants us to progress spiritually

the man who lets himself be dominated will never have consistency in his relationships

both the challenge and the spice of relationships is in peoples differences occasional frustration is the price of admission

do not get married if you are not ready to be faithful

love is the reason so we must listen to love before we reason

on the origin and purpose of life

any activity such as dancing which involves frequent longterm interaction with another person creates a great deal of mental emotional and physical memory in our being

the idea of dating anyone for money wasnt considered respectable even though that was something practiced since the beginning of time

and with our arrangement i realized he wasn’t paying for sex he was paying for me to be uncomplicated and i accepted the money to hide who i really was

she looked at him with clear disgust and said

you realize of course you are rife with multiple addictions he replied well perhaps

but i like to think of myself well rounded in that regard and btw i’d appreciate if you would lay off my hobbies

women are looking for a man that currently does not exist and men are looking for a woman that no longer exist

the constant vigilance and my heightened anxiety that id screw it up anyway exhausted me but i persevered

to love pleasure takes little to love truly takes a hero who can manage his own fear

people will reveal who they are if you just pay attention

you will never be lost in your lives if you rely on the love you have embraced and the love which embraced you

it’s not that love lacks power rather it’s that we’re too frightened to submit to a power that will demand vulnerability when we’ve invested the whole of our lives building walls

you really love him huh not just the sweet ‘oh we met in high school and just couldn’t seem to find someone else’ sort of love but the epic desperate ‘move mountains and cross oceans’ sort of love

too mushy i asked

i’ll survive

to look for solace is to learn to ask fiercer and more exquisitely pointed questions questions that reshape our identities and our bodies and our relation to others

she will not tell you all her thoughts feelings and emotions you have to understand her unsaid words

repay kindnesses and generosity bestowed upon you by continuing the giving extend yourself freely to others to sustain the positive cycle of giving

one of the most boring things about being in a relationship is that your partner usually makes their boredom your problem

time and shared experiences are key ingredients to creating bonds that last

even if you are just starting out in your career you have valuable perspectives and advice to share

the relationships you genuinely care about are the ones that will form the strongest network you can build

everything i have described so far seems to have happened to somebody else—to somebody else’s father but the death of a parent happens to you and once it starts it never stops it dislodges everything

you are me and i am you i dont feel you are separate from me

relationships develop best in the absence of a previously stated goal and a strict timetable but relationship management means setting goals and creating a plan

why does my heart desire you all the time

minutes may pass into hours and hours may pass into days and days may pass into months and months may pass into years but my heart will keep on falling in love with you every moment

that will always give me hope

i think when we love people we offer them the opportunity to break the barriers that prevent them from finding the love they deserve

why does my heart refuse to accept that it cant be near you all the time

you have to love her more when she does not have time to love herself

see the passion kiss the lips dont let this person slip by theyve given you a lustful heart an emotional gift

when they werent on the beach or sailing alicia and jack were indoors usually in the basement watching movies alicia missed so many important films during those frightening years

look at someone every day for long enough and you stop seeing what everyone else sees you start to see what no one else sees what is kept hidden from most people

when the right person hugs you its like medicine im so grateful for those few people in my life who are good for my soul

our moods meet in the wrong places

he picked up the pieces keeping his favorite parts away from my hammer

after truly knowing ryke i cant fathom shutting the door on a sibling its a bind thats different than a friendship its one that hurts more if it breaks but when its whole it means everything

spend all your time burning bridges and you’ll end up all wet when you have to swim to shore on the return

trust is a present deposit of a future assurance

and you like doing all this analyzing

i used to but the thrill is gone been gone its okay though its a living

and you studied many years to learn to do this

yep new york university bachelors and masters i dont even want to mention my mfa

of course i do winston but sometimes your attitude changes your needs and values change as you get older and what used to excite you doesnt anymore

so do you have this same attitude toward people when your attitude changes

what do you mean

i mean when you get bored or someone wears out their welcome do you treat them like you would your job do you just kind of settle in or do you look for a new one

sex is often had by someone to whom it means everything with someone to whom it means nothing

you cant be with someone when there are secrets relationships like that dont survive they sink

and thriving in my body

the energy you bring out in me

my power is overflowing

my lips are soft and welcoming

to the exhale

the new braille

the silence that persists

after our moans die away

i look at myself and say

root down so you can burn

beautiful girl its your turn

to create magic within yourself

this time without his help

find your roots and find your fire

be mindful of what you desire

persist in what you know is true

stay focused on the endless route

toward your own potential

allow the existential

void to swallow you whole

take on your old role

the lone seeker

become the beauty that you seek

embody strength if you feel weak

find love within the walls

of this sacred temple

let yourself shake and tremble

but keep your eyes ever fixed

on the horizon

where its rising

no revising

as you sail sail sail

toward the wail

of your siren spirit

beckoning you to bloom

the flower in your womb

the seed of creativity

your triumphant legacy

these words i will carry

within me as i bury

in the whispers of the wind

and when i arrive

to the altar of our origin

ill be dressed in white and black

and ill cradle that exact

feeling left on our sheets

and youll be on your knees

ready to receive

the wholeness of my broken mind

pried open by

the sparkle gleaming in your eyes

and your hands will be full

of supple fruit and youll

smile at me and i will see

that you have fed your hunger

youll ooze with courage and wonder

and then we will know

that weve already lost each other

a thousand times before

and i have found you

as clear water after mud settles

and you have found me

as a bee deep in a flowers petals

we have danced before

pulled art out of each others spines

we have died and birthed and died

weve already kissed a million times

this wasnt our first five act play

and it will not be the last

so when i thirst for your hands

i will sit and chant

we will meet again

we will meet again

the irony of lost love is that a person discovers wisps of wisdom when addressing their bundle of pain and frayed emotions relationships that fan out in flames contain learning rubrics in the dying embers

some relationships are like french fries they look good taste good but they are bad for your health  heart

while waiting for her to phone me at school id feel seconds bursting inside me and leaving clouds that wont come again—it cant ill never have that with anyone else ill never even come close

if my husband is working for rose he should not come to mary for salary at the end of the month

you also have to work with the love you are given with all of the complications clanging behind it like tin cans to a bridal sedan

the sooner we heal our traumas the sooner we liberate ourselves from the people who hurt us by hating them we hold onto them we cannot heal

when you feel something isn’t right you’re probably right listen to your gut instinct it’s sometimes smarter than your heart

we sometimes fall in love at last sight

where his skin touched hers it felt like there was a current of pure magic between them it was enough to boil her veins

women deformed by the pornographic sexual template

perceive other women as masturbatory objects

anne declared that if sarah abandoned her i swear to you i would shut myself up and never see a creature

people may say    that all is made up and well again but such breaches between great people are seldom or never so

so ended    a royal friendship which once could not be contained within the common bounds of love

it was never about saying the words to her it was about watching her react once i had said them

love is inconvenient love is untidy love is relentless ruthless and rapacious done well it’s hilarious playful and redemptive

it’s always her that turns a bad day into a great week by simply saying hello

with one touch of her hand all my fears are hidden its almost like a vivid dream that cant go wrong

birth of a baby not only creates a bond between

a baby and its parents but it also gives birth to

take what people give you and let that be enough because people usually give all theyre capable of giving the way theyre capable of giving it and expecting more than that is just setting the relationship up to fail

one of the most puzzling aspects of love is its lack of justice it’s unfair love can elude people who seem to deserve it while it’s heaped on those who appear to ignore it run from it or slough it off as too restrictive

maturity in any relationship makes the practice of love comfortable

its better to be with someone who has the same sleep patterns

the law of giving give first

sex has through being photographed become a thing to be

observed to be performed rather than experienced so deeply

that it is unnecessary even to open one’s eyes

it is unnatural and provocative and precarious and challenging it demands forbearance and stamina and abnormal powers of empathy and perception

it is also and yes it is also all those other things the opposite the converse the place you want to be

she was such a solitary woman a solitary woman who longed for one person to know her i think i do know her now but it is too late

she was her own enigma code and me and my dad were not bletchley park

the heart is not a small place

many can reside there

as long as the rooms are all decided

there’s a difference between extending grace and receiving abuse

her face was an open book and yet he was still confounded by her

surely our greatest and most longlasting relationship is with ourselves

how much i’d been thwarted into a carefully constructed nothingness by that man

if we were in a proper relationship and i did live with him and was officially committed to him first thing i would have to do would be to leave

also found the situation unworkable not just unworkable – ridiculous not just ridiculous – perturbing

maybe you will kiss the modern bride

lets agree to disagree babe

just duct tape my heart to yours babe

there are people who help you and people who hurt you you keep the former you keep the former until they become the latter and hope that you never hurt the former

sometimes letting go is simply allowing yourself to come to terms with the truth that you have been watering dead plants

there were three sides to a marriage public and private and whofuckingknows one lived and one performed and one a thundering mystery

i firmly believe that relationships dont end because new people come along to break them up people come along to break them up because something else in the relationship is already off

you see the separation of life as very arbitrary at this time

you are not alone in this assumption

you have far more connection than you are even vaguely aware of

you will not lose the love that is yours

even though it was weird to talk on the telephone only eight times seven maybe six ever had i done so

the connections we create in our lives are the ones that will carry us through even the darkest of days

pauline believed that marriage was an interweaving of souls while michael viewed it as two people traveling side by side but separately what are you thinking about she liked to say and tell me what you honestly feel

youre still the same people underneath

why is it that i feel so alive when i keep talking or chatting with you

it’s an amusing world it’s easier to maintain distance than to maintain relationships

givers are never greedy greedy ones never give

the person who doesnt have patience for your imperfections is usually sitting on a mountain of their own

its marvelous to know another persons entire literary canon by heart its like knowing their secret personal language

hope can have sharp edges as it leaves you

help someone smile and laugh today

one thing i was absolutely sure of was his love love made any problem solvable

the only things you take to heaven with you are the relationships you build here on earth

sometimes the beginnings of relationships are the hardest people always say the beginning is the easiest but two people trying to let their guards down and be open to intimacy can be hard too

in big cities in the summertime people of long since lost track of each other or who don’t even know each other meet one evening on the terrace and lose each other again and none of it really matters

the best friendships do not require that anyone keep the upper hand

working briefly on your marriage every day will do more for your health and longevity than working out at a health club

invest your time and money in connecting yourself and others

seek to build relationships that are in alignment with your dreams relationships thatll challenge and inspire you to grow

who you meet is more important than where you go adventures are best remembered by the depth of connections with friends not countries visited

i firmly believe strangers are just friends i haven’t met yet

let’s do life together – it’s far better

he couldnt give me what i wanted because he didnt have it to give i saw an ideal of him and kept trying to get him to fit that mold because i didnt want to let go of the illusion of who he was

if you want to shine like a precious gold

focus always on yourself both inside and out

you can always end an argument it starts with shutting your mouth

just because youre in pain it doesnt mean you have to drag everyone down to your level of hurt no one can help if everyone around youis in pain

we got the message that day we could be friends at home but out in the world we didn’t know each other

every time you decide not to compromise your honesty in any form of a relationship you become a copartner with the universe in creating truthful meaning for any existence

the real rich all live with the motto that ‘there is no free lunch’ and they know how to cultivate and invest in good relationships with guiin

the belief that someone loves us or should or can love us as much as we love ourselves is one of the most common signs of intellectual immaturity

don’t underestimate your ability to bring

value to someone else

i am’ he whispers the monster i warned you against’

you are’ i say hoarsely the monster i claim

sin is not about the personal imperfection of the self rather sin is any act that breaks any of the relationships god declared very good in the beginning

when it’s the wrong person anything you ask is too much

god is not separate from us the essence of god is in our hearts though we have veils between god and us on the physical level on the level of the human body that does not mean god is separate from us

everyone knows that sadness and grief are the price of admission for the experiences of joy and connection

painful indeed is the panegyric of those we contemn

whoever taught you that love hurts lied it’s lack of true sensuality that hurts

you may search my countenance but you cannot read it

when someone goes away from you suddenly without warning thats what its like a rip a torn edge inside you i have a torn edge in me and dad has a torn edge in him im not sure if those edges will still fit together by the time i find him

i’m glad you told me thank you for trusting me with the truth

i looked up and smiled i trust you with my heart giving you the truth was easy

i see the universe in your eyes

i’m living life in color i’m not compromising that

some people get lucky and partner up with someone the same age they know the same songs have the same references and all that good for them but for the rest of us it’s catchascatchcan

the art of working with people is found in meeting them where they’re at which means i must be willing to go where i am not

it is in imposing my expectations on others that i birth my greatest frustrations

i used to think love was elusive until i realized i was just getting in my own way i had to learn to let go and make room for someone to show me love instead of holding on to someone i wish would

your life and relationships are only as great as your sensuality

tell the ones you love that you do love them before it is too late

but now he knew you always sacrificed something the question was what you sacrificed

in the contorted bookkeeping of the broken the distance you hold yourself away from them is your only value

givers are never greedy the greedy never give

the search for security might translate into ways that you choose to guard your heart and emotions in romantic relationships

kunyaza empowers women who frequently ejaculate awakens hidden sensations of women who rarely ejaculate and introduces a new possibility of sexual pleasure to women who did not know that they could ejaculate

if you didnt yearn for something you wouldnt be disappointed and anyway relationships were a waste of time

good relationships dont just happen they take time patience and two people getting through all the hard times together

hearts are broken if we are not prepared to heal ourselves

you are the flame not the moth and your job is to burn with conviction

dont let your life goals fall victim to the allure of comfortable routines

who else well deal with her we say meanwhile neither of you moves towards spiritual growth she continues toxic patterns and you spiral in frustration resentment and fatigue

she is unmastered

we read not only because we cannot know enough people but because friendship is so vulnerable so likely to diminish or disappear overcome by space time imperfect sympathies and all the sorrows of familial and passional life

our hearts are channels from which we experience and are connected to the divine flow of creation it’s the channel in which we transcend our emotions and come to know love in this space we exist without constructs

who cares if the people in your life dont like the boundaries you set for yourself their happiness is not your responsibility

it is possible for you to be the wrong one in an argument about you

all i wanted was to merge with the same person who had broken me thinking that he was the only one who could fill in all the little crevices making me feel whole again

you didnt lose me laurel im still yours ill always be yours

well thats not strictly true is it

he sighs again

hearts dont reject love

fear of rejection slaughters the voice from our heart

but time is short

and life is to be lived

so dont fear to speak your hearts truth

what you feel matters more than the thoughts or opinions of others

and rejection is an impeding sinister state of mind

remember hearts dont reject love only minds do that

the existential truth is that we are all exposed

we are all vulnerable

whether we are fierce enough to admit it…or not

resentment has a way of metastasizing into bitterness and bitterness has a way of curdling into the kind of anger that can doom a relationship

it’s quite rare to find someone who sees the same world you see

i think sometimes we fall in love just because it feels so good to love someone to desire them to yearn for another human being to cross the boundary of aloneness that is part of human existence

it was better to be alone than to be stuck with people who were supposed to love you yet couldn’t

a photon or an electron is not a thing it is a description of a relationship

what else is left

and you got two good stories

that are getting stale

as well as we know our grown children and relatives we dont know how much energy they have to put into simply keeping their lives together at all

ignoring her is only teaching her to live without you guys be thinking she is suffering the whole time shes adjusting⌛

learning to eat greet learn and lead are indispensable for growth and impact

the signs you ignore in the beginning end up being the reasons you leave later

—trust yourself—

as i observed him sitting there a heavy look in his eyes i longed to reach behind that barrier and pull out the warm sensitive passionate man i knew was trapped inside

there was nothing worse than feeling someone’s potential

they were all just sitting here waiting what were they meant to be doing the desire to interact was an irresistible itch

we bother people with our problem whenever we tell them that we miss them

the other thing about falling in love the harder you fell the easier it was to get hurt maybe that’s why it was called falling in love at some point there was a crash at the bottom that could shatter someone into a million pieces

isnt this all we request from love

a brave vulnerable and sincere exposure

to be candidly seen in all our faults

blemishes quirks and flaws

yet still be so implicitly loved

and most of all

there were many things she could have said but we forget to forge armor against the knifethrusts of our loved ones

when we live in alignment with who we are and how we want to live we will attract and find likeminded individuals

dad she said

do you want some coffee he asked are you okay

she shook her head no

she knew all this but logic is fallacy when it spars with instinct so she fell anyway

if you want to make others feel good start by feeling good yourself

when you enter your next relationship you become the person you split up with

people are more apt to remember how you made them feel than what you said

you have to believe me without proof thats what faith is — believing without proof

realizing you wasted time with a boy who had no intention of growing with you feels much like selling yourself for a dime bag of weed

sometimes it is necessary to distance ourselves emotionally in some relationships

the people you meet in your life you meet them for a specific purpose to help them and to be helped by them so try to spot the treasure in your everyday life because one day you may realize you had the treasure and you lost it

a lifechanging moment for me was the realization that sometimes the healthiest relationship you can have with someone or something is none at all

if it didnt make you cry it wasnt real

she is now dancing with someone else to the song that reminded me of us

maybe snow white never wakes up more likely than anything else really you can’t kiss a girl into anything

us over time passing by

thats pretty good lexi took a sip of the coffee desperate for caffeine what are your views on relationships

sahar smiled dont settle until you find the one who makes you want to say yaaburnee

what

its arabic for you bury me the hope that the person you love will outlive you so that you will be spared the pain of living without them

love is kind not rude love brings heartbreak love brings life love brings healthy relationships love never forces

i lack experience in so many ways

i think we could be good friends if you just saw me for the person i am not the person you think i am

he who believes in soul mates never ceases to doubt if his current partner is truly the one as a result the great irony emerges those who believe in soul mates are much less likely to actually find one

major turnoff… when someone’s sense of entitlement is greatly disproportionate to their sense of gratitude

most of the conversation was said with our eyes our eyes told truths neither of us could understand her a goddess and me her pew it was spent with me looking at her and her looking elsewhere perpendicular

you look like someone

who has gone to war

and came back

with a thousand deaths burned in his eyes

you look like someone

who has been told a dozen promises –

promises that broke his heart

when he realized

he didnt matter enough

for them to be kept

you look like someone

whose edges started to chip away

you look like someone i could love

someone whose darkness i could light up

but goddamn it darling

i promised myself

i would never fall in love with a broken man

i have loved so many broken people

and i have fixed them all up

i kept giving all i had

until i had nothing left to give

you look like someone i could love

someone i want to fall in love with

but you‘re in pieces

i know you‘ll just wound me

we ended the way all good things in my life had a way of being put to rest – abrupt and without my permission

im so sorry no one cared enough to tell you that you can never win against a ghost

i want to ruin you in the ugliest way imaginable so that someday when you have to tell your children about me it will take every breath you have to hide the catch in your throat

i don‘t know if you noticed but i have been trying too hard to be myself since the day i lost you

dont fall in love with me i am dissonance i am always at war with myself – confusing my head with my heart always retreating into my mind because i don‘t want to lose

he was broken in the best way – in a way that made me stop and stare and want to love him

people prefer talking about each other rather than talking to each other

the women i write about have to fight for what they want sometimes against forceful odds its a kinetic experience an intense ride

our outlines feel the same i think i can hide inside you

i color my nails black

and dye my hair red

to wear in metaphors

what my heart wants

the things i don‘t wish to remember

leaking from the tips of my fingers

the things i wish i won‘t forget

clinging to the roots of my hair

women who play hard to get make life seem shorter

it is never just a kiss

it is the marriage

that have decided

they can stand

each other‘s arrogance

relationships take time but we don’t want to take the time in reality too busy is a myth people make time for the things that are really important to them

i’ll listen to your words as long as your actions don’t speak louder

heaven has never been a place heaven is just a feeling

and us—we already changed—the two of us and both together—and now we gotta change some more

must we he asked and she felt him put his cheek against her hair

i can’t see any way out of it if we’re gonna do what we said we’d do right up front we’re gonna hafta stop thinking that surviving ’til lunchtime is a longterm plan

he laughed softly until dinner then

it’s a start she said

of course i will like forever any woman who has gone to bed with me as long as we don’t become a couple and hate each other forever

people will tell you not to give up but theyre always tired of you

love yourself enough to leave behind anything or anyone that no longer serves your best interest

love which is a kind of permission to come closer than ordinary norms of good behavior might usually sanction

which enables us to see each other without clothes on for example in lust and shame

which allows us to say wounding things to each other which would not be kosher under the ordinary rules of civilized discourse

the biggest lie i ever told anyone was that i would not leave

two insane idiots with the same idea that is what love is

i think men that read books are the most attractive kind

effective listening is the single most powerful thing you can do to build and maintain a climate of trust and collaboration strong listening skills are the foundation for all solid relationships

people like people who are like them

this is the foundation of the law of listening you have to listen to understand

keep your memories and i will keep mine and maybe one day they will fit together like our hands once did

genuine curiosity can lead to more authentic engaging conversations which lay the foundation for sustained relationships

no matter what they say how they treat you is how they feel about you

some silences are more meaningful than thousands of long sentences

happiness can be found inside our own hearts and not in some shallow relationships people with integrity know how precious time is and they refuse to waste it on people who dont bother to respect it

listening is a powerful building block continue improving your listening skills and your likability will naturally increase

you haven’t yet learned that your worth isn’t found in him or in the man before him or in any man at all

once in a blue moon life will blow you a rarity and it will leave you with astonishment

avoiding others because they don’t suit my way of life is tragic

when someone elses happiness becomes the prerequisite of your happiness you know that you are in love

take a break from relationships and dedicate yourself to selfcare and personal healing you need to stop bleeding on people who didn’t cut you

there are two kinds of relationships

there’s no love this is not love

the space between us

mind the space so long endured

it’s best for our protection

i hope it’s true for if it’s not

a thousand loves have i betrayed

a voice it sings as if it was a lullaby

but if i heed it may become

the lure of my demise

in fear we come together

in fear we keep the space

lest our refuge become our captor

the moments of sweetness

so easily discarded

when danger calls from

the abyss between the two

do not push away love’s hand

in punishment for what it cannot give

together we bypass the gap

which is as deep as it is old

forget the chasm

so jaded with angry dreams

our fear is emptyhanded

love’s hand has room for the other

there will always be that one person we dream of even if we do not sleep

can you not remember

when did this brutality grow can you not remember

go back to the place where you left that man dying

this time you must bring him back with you

i see you in my dreams your face is edged with battle

i touch your forehead from a distant land

the earth glare is so bright it washes the white memory from your mind

have you forgotten we come from the same place

when did this brutality grow can you not remember

go back to the place where you left that man dying

this time you must bring him back with you

you are looking for something demanding to be found

make your way back from that broken land return from that empty place

there is nothing there for you it holds a million shadows

there are no friends there

when did this brutality grow can you not remember

go back to the place where you left that man dying

this time you must bring him back with you

it is warmer here can you see the light trust it it is safe

it has lived a long time it has seen much more than you

you fight a demon that you once knew but the demon is already slain

and from the corner of your eye you will see the scattered sacred fire reform again

when someone treats you like a shit you’re nothing more than a shit in that person’s life

stop fooling yourself

relationship problems are for rich people poor people have things like hunger bills clothes and medicine

only those who look closely will see the beauty between her flaws

all those other gestures of sympathy seemed a little melodramatic to me my loss was mine and only mine for the others it was just a matter of words

in the blink of an eye

youre gone

do you miss me

we were on

grab your chin

with my palm

kiss your cheek

but continuing to initiate conversations and be curious about people is fundamental to building valuable relationships because curiosity creates connections—that is the law of curiosity

why are you staring at me

the girl asked
