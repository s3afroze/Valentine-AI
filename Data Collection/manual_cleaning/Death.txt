to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure

im not afraid of death i just dont want to be there when it happens

love never dies a natural death it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of witherings of tarnishings

i wish it need not have happened in my time said frodo

so do i said gandalf and so do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us

im the one thats got to die when its time for me to die so let me live my life the way i want to

the fear of death follows from the fear of life a man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time

death ends a life not a relationship

deaths got an invisibility cloak harry interrupted again

so he can sneak up on people said ron sometimes he gets bored of running at them flapping his arms and shrieking

i dont care harry yelled at them snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace ive had enough ive seen enough i want out i want it to end i dont care anymore

you do care said dumbledore he had not flinched or made a single move to stop harry demolishing his office his expression was calm almost detached you care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it

a thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it

it is said that your life flashes before your eyes just before you die that is true its called life

i dont want to die without any scars

my dear

find what you love and let it kill you

let it drain you of your all let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness

let it kill you and let it devour your remains

for all things will kill you both slowly and fastly but it’s much better to be killed by a lover

falsely yours

i do not fear death i had been dead for billions and billions of years before i was born and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it

when he shall die

take him and cut him out in little stars

and he will make the face of heaven so fine

that all the world will be in love with night

and pay no worship to the garish sun

it kills me sometimes how people die

unbeing dead isnt being alive

life is for the living

death is for the dead

let life be like music

and death a note unsaid

youll stay with me

until the very end said james

i go to seek a great perhaps

if you gave someone your heart and they died did they take it with them did you spend the rest of forever with a hole inside you that couldnt be filled

that was the thing you never got used to it the idea of someone being gone just when you think its reconciled accepted someone points it out to you and it just hits you all over again that shocking

things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end if not always in the way we expect

even death has a heart

dont feel bad im usually about to die

when people dont express themselves they die one piece at a time

to be or not to be that is the question

whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer

the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune

or to take arms against a sea of troubles

and by opposing end them to die to sleep

no more and by a sleep to say we end

the heartache and the thousand natural shocks

that flesh is heir to tis a consummation

devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep

to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub

for in that sleep of death what dreams may come

when we have shuffled off this mortal coil

must give us pause theres the respect

that makes calamity of so long life

for who would bear the whips and scorns of time

the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely

the pangs of despised love the laws delay

the insolence of office and the spurns

that patient merit of the unworthy takes

when he himself might his quietus make

with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear

to grunt and sweat under a weary life

but that the dread of something after death

the undiscoverd country from whose bourn

no traveller returns puzzles the will

and makes us rather bear those ills we have

than fly to others that we know not of

thus conscience does make cowards of us all

and thus the native hue of resolution

is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought

and enterprises of great pith and moment

with this regard their currents turn awry

and lose the name of actionsoft you now

the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons

be all my sins rememberd

i meant said ipslore bitterly what is there in this world that truly makes living worthwhile

death thought about it

cats he said eventually cats are nice

older men declare war but it is youth that must fight and die

dont think of it as dying said death just think of it as leaving early to avoid the rush

if you have a sister and she dies do you stop saying you have one or are you always a sister even when the other half of the equation is gone

the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death

i could die for you but i couldnt and wouldnt live for you

if death meant just leaving the stage long enough to change costume and come back as a new characterwould you slow down or speed up

you only live twice

once when you are born

and once when you look death in the face

stop fighting me he said trying to pull on the arm he held

he was in a precarious position himself straddling the rail as he tried to lean over far enough to get me and actually hold onto me

let go of me i yelled back

but he was too strong and managed to haul most of me over the rail enough so that i wasn’t in total danger of falling again

i looked him in the eye i will always love you

then i plunged the stake into his chest

that’s what i was supposed to say   he gasped out

those were his last words

a small but noteworthy note ive seen so many young men over the years who think theyre running at other young men they are not they are running at me

a girl calls and asks does it hurt very much to die

well sweetheart i tell her yes but it hurts a lot more to keep living

there is a place in the heart that

will never be filled

and even during the

and

the greatest times

we will know it

we will know it

more than

there is a place in the heart that

will never be filled

and

we will wait

and

in that space

death is so terribly final while life is full of possibilities

it is nothing to die it is frightful not to live

each night when i go to sleep i die and the next morning when i wake up i am reborn

sleep those little slices of death — how i loathe them

does it hurt the childish question had escaped harrys lips before he could stop it

dying not at all said sirius quicker and easier than falling asleep

and what would humans be without love

love is how you stay alive even after you are gone

death is not the opposite of life but a part of it

life is pleasant death is peaceful its the transition thats troublesome

and he suddenly knew that if she killed herself he would die maybe not immediately maybe not with the same blinding rush of pain but it would happen you couldnt live for very long without a heart

death is no more than passing from one room into another but theres a difference for me you know because in that other room i shall be able to see

no one really knows why they are alive until they know what theyd die for

if there are no dogs in heaven then when i die i want to go where they went

people living deeply have no fear of death

the dead can survive as part of the lives of those that still live

every mans life ends the same way it is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another

one lives in the hope of becoming a memory

at the temple there is a poem called loss carved into the stone it has three words but the poet has scratched them out you cannot read loss only feel it

thats what literature is its the people who went before us tapping out messages from the past from beyond the grave trying to tell us about life and death listen to them

is an art like everything else

i do it exceptionally well

i do it so it feels like hell

i do it so it feels real

i guess you could say i have a call

a man with outward courage dares to die a man with inner courage dares to live

here lies dobby a free elf

many people die at twenty five and arent buried until they are seventy five

the meaning of life is that it stops

to live in hearts we leave behind is not to die

its better to burn out than to fade away

ginny listeni cant be involved with you anymore weve got to stop seeing each other we cant be together

its for some stupid noble reason isnt it

what if i dont care

i care how do you think id feel if this was your funeraland it was my fault

death there are better things in the world than alcohol albert

albert oh yes sir but alcohol sort of compensates for not getting them

together they would watch everything that was so carefully planned collapse and they would smile at the beauty of destruction

if i die i will wait for you do you understand no matter how long i will watch from beyond to make sure you live every year you have to its fullest and then we’ll have so much to talk about when i see you again… bones

fear not death for the sooner we die the longer we shall be immortal

it is not death that a man should fear but he should fear never beginning to live

the heart dies a slow death shedding each hope like leaves until one day there are none no hopes nothing remains

mostly it is loss which teaches us about the worth of things

books are finite sexual encounters are finite but the desire to read and to fuck is infinite it surpasses our own deaths our fears our hopes for peace

hed been wrong there was a light at the end of the tunnel and it was a flamethrower

there is love in holding and there is love in letting go

im gonna kill him eve said or at least that was what it sounded like filtered through the pillow

stake him right in the heart shove garlic up his ass andand

and what michael

when did you get home claire demanded

apparently just in time to hear my funeral plans i especially like the garlic up the ass itsdifferent

when great trees fall

when great trees fall

lions hunker down

and even elephants

lumber after safety

when great trees fall

small things recoil into silence

their senses

the air around us becomes

we breathe briefly

our eyes briefly

see with

our memory suddenly sharpened

our reality bound to

them takes leave of us

our souls

dependent upon their

now shrink wizened

our minds formed

and informed by their

we are not so much maddened

as reduced to the unutterable ignorance

and when great souls die

after a period peace blooms

slowly and always

with a kind of

our senses restored never

to be the same whisper to us

they existed they existed

we can be be and be

better for they existed

when he died all things soft and beautiful and bright would be buried with him

though lovers be lost love shall not and death shall have no dominion

no one can say that death found in me a willing comrade or that i went easily

the heaviness of loss in her heart hadnt eased but there was room there for humour too

do not go gentle into that good night

old age should burn and rage at close of day

rage rage against the dying of the light

because their words had forked no lightning they

do not go gentle into that good night

good men the last wave by crying how bright

their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay

rage rage against the dying of the light

wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight

and learn too late they grieved it on its way

do not go gentle into that good night

grave men near death who see with blinding sight

blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay

rage rage against the dying of the light

and you my father there on the sad height

curse bless me now with your fierce tears i pray

do not go gentle into that good night

rage rage against the dying of the light

yea all things live forever though at times they sleep and are forgotten

for what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun and when the earth shall claim your limbs then shall you truly dance

you do not immortalize the lost by writing about them language buries but does not resurrect

killing is not so easy as the innocent believe

the funny thing about facing imminent death is that it really snaps everything else into perspective

the idea of being strong for someone else having never entered their heads i find myself in the position of having to console them since im the person going in to be slaughtered this is somewhat annoying

i wishi wish i were dead

and what use would that be to anyone

nobody owns life but anyone who can pick up a frying pan owns death

weeping is not the same thing as crying it takes your whole body to weep and when its over you feel like you dont have any bones left to hold you up

would it hurt to die

the death of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world

we die containing a richness of lovers and tribes tastes we have swallowed bodies we have plunged into and swum up as if rivers of wisdom characters we have climbed into as if trees fears we have hidden in as if caves

reality means you live until you diethe real truth is nobody wants reality

men should think twice before making widowhood womens only path to power

because there is no glory in illness there is no meaning to it there is no honor in dying of

i want words at my funeral but i guess that means you need life in your life

delaying death is one of my favorite hobbies

we who think we are about to die will laugh at anything

do you not know that a man is not dead while his name is still spoken

i carry death in my left pocket sometimes i take it out and talk to it hello baby how you doing when you coming for me ill be ready

but death was her curse and her gift and death had been her good friend these long long years

he died that day because his body had served its purpose his soul had done what it came to do learned what it came to learn and then was free to leave

that is not dead which can eternal lie

and with strange aeons even death may die

no one here gets out alive

it seems to me that if you or i must choose between two courses of thought or action we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure to the world

everybody going to be dead one day just give them time

i was always holding onto people and they were always leaving

in the end it wasnt death that surprised her but the stubbornness of life

he was my north my south my east and west

my working week and my sunday rest

my noon my midnight my talk my song

i thought that love would last forever i was wrong

what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying

they tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice that suicide is wrong when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in this world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person

after all whats a life anyway were born we live a little while we die

carve your name on hearts not tombstones a legacy is etched into the minds of others and the stories they share about you

yes i know it

in the darkness of my darkbeating heart i know hed have loved it all right

you see

even death has a heart

i was waiting for the longest time she said i thought you forgot

it is hard to forget i said when there is such an empty space when you are gone

its better to die laughing than to live each moment in fear

when we die we will turn into songs and we will hear each other and remember each other

it is the job of thinking people not to be on the side of the executioners

i felt the unfairness of it the inarguable injustice of loving someone who might have loved you back but cant due to deadness

in time in time they tell me ill not feel so bad i dont want time to heal me theres a reason im like this

i want time to set me ugly and knotted with loss of you marking me i wont smooth you away

i cant say goodbye

i went down to the river

i set down on the bank

i tried to think but couldnt

so i jumped in and sank

losing your life is not the worst thing that can happen the worst thing is to lose your reason for living

death must be so beautiful to lie in the soft brown earth with the grasses waving above one’s head and listen to silence to have no yesterday and no tomorrow to forget time to forgive life to be at peace

six hundred and forty fish later the only thing i know is everything you love will die the first time you meet someone special you can count on them one day being dead and in the ground

death leaves a heartache no one can heal love leaves a memory no one can steal

from an irish headstone

our revels now are ended these our actors

as i foretold you were all spirits and

are melted into air into thin air

and like the baseless fabric of this vision

the cloudcapp’d towers the gorgeous palaces

the solemn temples the great globe itself

yea all which it inherit shall dissolve

and like this insubstantial pageant faded

leave not a rack behind we are such stuff

as dreams are made on and our little life

is rounded with a sleep

stars she whispered i can see the stars again my lady

a tear trickled down artemiss cheek yes my brave one they are beautiful tonight

stars zoe repeated her eyes fixed on the night sky and she did not move again

o serpent heart hid with a flowering face

did ever a dragon keep so fair a cave

beautiful tyrant feind angelical dove feather raven wolvishravening lamb despised substance of devinest show just opposite to what thou justly seemest  a dammed saint an honourable villain

youre hells angels then what chapter are you from

a single death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic

there once was a girl who found herself dead

she peered over the ledge of heaven

and saw that back on earth

her sister missed her too much

was way too sad

so she crossed some paths

that would not have crossed

took some moments in her hand

shook them up

and spilled them like dice

over the living world

it worked

the boy with the guitar collided

with her sister

there you go len she whispered the rest is up to you

surely it was a good way to die in the place of someone else someone i loved

women were different no doubt about it men broke so much more quickly grief didnt break women instead it wore them down it hollowed them out very slowly

people die i think but your relationship with them doesnt it continues and is everchanging

if you live each day as it was your last someday youll most certainly be right

wed stared into the face of death and death blinked first youd think that would make us feel brave and invincible it didnt

but she wasn’t around and that’s the thing when your parents die you feel like instead of going in to every fight with backup you are going into every fight alone

to be or not to be that is the question

whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer

the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune

or to take arms against a sea of troubles

and by opposing end them to die to sleep

no more and by a sleep to say we end

the heartache and the thousand natural shocks

that flesh is heir to ’tis a consummation

devoutly to be wish’d to die to sleep

to sleep perchance to dream ay there’s the rub

the phoenix must burn to emerge

no one is actually dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away

from my rotting body flowers shall grow and i am in them and that is eternity

im not afraid of death because i dont believe in it

its just getting out of one car and into another

i do not carry a sickle or scythe

i only wear a hooded black robe when its cold

and i dont have those skulllike facial features you seem to enjoy pinning on me from a distance you want to know what i truly look like ill help you out find yourself a mirror while i continue

madame all stories if continued far enough end in death and he is no truestory teller who would keep that from you

death is not the greatest loss in life the greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live

its perfect locke would appreciate it

bug calo said locke is our brother and our love for him knows no bounds but the four most fatal words in the therin language are locke would appreciate it

rivalled only by locke taught me a new trick added galo

the only person who gets away with locke lamora games

because we think the gods are saving him up for a really big death something with knives and hot irons

and fifty thousand cheering spectators

my heart has joined the thousand for my friend stopped running today

pulvis et umbra sumus we are but dust and shadow

i have outlasted all desire

my dreams and i have grown apart

my grief alone is left entire

the gleamings of an empty heart

the storms of ruthless dispensation

have struck my flowery garland numb

i live in lonely desolation

and wonder when my end will come

by tardy winters whistling chill

a single leaf which has outlasted

its season will be trembling still

he is terribly afraid of dying because he hasn’t yet lived

i am afraid not of life or death or nothingness but of wasting it as if i had never been

you fuck  you ate my cat

death is a stripping away of all that is not you the secret of life is to die before you die  and find that there is no death

things die but they dont always stay dead believe me i know

would you like me to kill you now asked snape his voice heavy with irony or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph

people leave strange little memories of themselves behind when they die

enjoy life theres plenty of time to be dead

its only in drugs or death well see anything new and death is just too controlling

my father took one hundred and thirtytwo minutes to die

if they tell you that she died of sleeping pills you must know that she died of a wasting grief of a slow bleeding at the soul

death therefore the most awful of evils is nothing to us seeing that when we are death is not come and when death is come we are not

its not reasonable to love people who are only going to die she said

nash thought about that for a moment stroking smalls neck with great deliberation as if the fate of the dells depended on that smooth careful movement

yes she whispered

he stroked smalls nose i love you he said even knowing youll never have me and i love my brother more than i ever realized before you came along you cant help whom you love lady nor can you know what its liable to cause you to do

live or die but dont poison everything

people rarely bring flowers to a suicide

what do you most value in your friends

their continued existence

in this land some of us fuck more than

we die but most of us die

better than we fuck

there are three deaths the first is when the body ceases to function the second is when the body is consigned to the grave the third is that moment sometime in the future when your name is spoken for the last time

death taxes and childbirth theres never any convenient time for any of them

sweets to the sweet

stop all the clocks cut off the telephone

prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone

silence the pianos and with muffled drum

bring out the coffin let the mourners come

scribbling on the sky the message he is dead

put crêpe bows round the white necks of the public doves

let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves

he was my north my south my east and west

my working week and my sunday rest

my noon my midnight my talk my song

i thought that love would last for ever i was wrong

the stars are not wanted now put out every one

pack up the moon and dismantle the sun

pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood

for nothing now can ever come to any good

those we love never truly leave us harry there are things that death cannot touch

when writers die they become books which is after all not too bad an incarnation

as attributed by alastair reid in neruda and borges the new yorker june   as well as in the talk of the town the new yorker july

the trouble about jumping was that if you didnt pick the right number of storeys you might still be alive when you hit bottom

i will not tell you our love story becauselike all real love storiesit will die with usas it should

be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity

we may not get to choose how we die but we can chose how we live

the universe may forget us but it doesnt matter because we are the ants and well keep marching on

i have noticed that even those who assert that everything is predestined and that we can change nothing about it still look both ways before they cross the street

the boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague who shall say where the one ends and where the other begins

end no the journey doesnt end here death is just another path one that we all must take the grey raincurtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silver glass and then you see it

everyone grieves in different ways for some it could take longer or shorter i do know it never disappears an ember still smolders inside me most days i don’t notice it but out of the blue it’ll flare to life

i have done it she says at first i do not understand but then i see the tomb and the marks she has made on the stone a c h i l l e s it reads and beside it p a t r o c l u s

go she says he waits for you

in the darkness two shadows reaching through the hopeless heavy dusk their hands meet and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun

i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived

death should take me while i am in the mood

i think people believe in heaven because they dont like the idea of dying because they want to carry on living and they dont like the idea that other people will move into their house and put their things into the rubbish

he is not dead

i cannot say and i will not say

that he is dead he is just away

with a cheery smile and a wave of the hand

he has wandered into an unknown land

and left us dreaming how very fair

it needs must be since he lingers there

and you—oh you who the wildest yearn

for an oldtime step and the glad return

think of him faring on as dear

in the love of there as the love of here

think of him still as the same i say

he is not dead—he is just away

even in the grave all is not lost

the sadness will last forever

the death of a beloved is an amputation

yes its a wellknown fact about you youre like death you take everything

how could you go about choosing something that would hold the half of your heart you had to bury

i know too that death is the only god who comes when you call

there is no escape—we pay for the violence of our ancestors

life is too short when you think of the length of death

so wise so young they say do never live long

death so called is a thing which makes men weep and yet a third of life is passed in sleep

the whole image is that eternal suffering awaits anyone who questions gods infinite love thats the message were brought up with isnt it believe or die thank you forgiving lord for all those options

and if youve managed to drag yourself from the bed and go down the road to the garden center or the drug store by then the worst is over at that point you might as well just go to work

we are born in one day we die in one day we can change in one day and we can fall in love in one day anything can happen in just one day

our lives cant be measured by our final years of this i am sure

people do not die for us immediately but remain bathed in a sort of aura of

life which bears no relation to true immortality but through which they

continue to occupy our thoughts in the same way as when they were alive it

is as though they were traveling abroad

the absence of the will to live is alas not sufficient to make one want to die

there comes a time when we realize that our parents cannot save themselves or save us that everyone who wades through time eventually gets dragged out to sea by the undertow that in short we are all going

when i am dead my dearest

when i am dead my dearest

sing no sad songs for me

plant thou no roses at my head

nor shady cypresstree

be the green grass above me

with showers and dewdrops wet

and if thou wilt remember

and if thou wilt forget

i shall not see the shadows

i shall not feel the rain

i shall not hear the nightingale

sing on as if in pain

and dreaming through the twilight

that doth not rise nor set

and haply may forget

time that withers you will wither me we will fall like ripe fruit and roll down the grass together dear friend let me lie beside you watching the clouds until the earth covers us and we are gone

dogs do not have many advantages over people but one of them is extremely important euthanasia is not forbidden by law in their case animals have the right to a merciful death

owning a dog always ended with this sadness because dogs just dont live as long as people do

it was a hurting tune resigned a cry of heartache for all in the world that fell apart as ash rose black against the brilliant sky fires fiddle cried out for the dead and for the living who stay behind to say goodbye

its all crap

life has no meaning

none nowhere to be found

why doesnt anybody realize this

how could the death of someone you had never met affect you so

do not stand at my grave and weep

i am not there i do not sleep

i am in a thousand winds that blow

i am the softly falling snow

i am the gentle showers of rain

i am the fields of ripening grain

i am in the morning hush

i am in the graceful rush

i am the starshine of the night

i am in the flowers that bloom

i am in a quiet room

i am in the birds that sing

i am in each lovely thing

do not stand at my grave bereft

i am not there i have not left

son everyone dies alone thats what it is its a door its one person wide when you go through it you do it alone but it doesnt mean youve got to be alone before you go through the door and believe me you arent alone on the other side

it reminds me that no embrace will ever feel the same again because no one will ever be like her again because shes gone shes gone and crying feels so useless so stupid but its all i can do

a piece of me is gone she told me once while we were bra shopping i think were made up of all these different pieces and every time someone goes youre left with less of yourself

to escape death shed become death

the hour of departure has arrived and we go our separate ways i to die and you to live which of these two is better only god knows

depression isnt a war you win its a battle you fight every day you never stop never get to rest its one bloody fray after another

do people look the same when they go to heaven mommy

i dont know i dont think so

then how do people recognize each other

i dont know sweetie they just feel it you dont need your eyes to love right

the language of love letters is the same as suicide notes

most men fear getting laughed at or humiliated by a romantic prospect while most women fear rape and death

she had been given a wonderful gift life sometimes it was cruelly taken away too soon but its what you did with it that counted not how long it lasted

the end is in the beginning and yet you go on

despite the mayhem that followed bruno found that he was still holding shmuels hand in his own and nothing in the world would have persuaded him to let go

the man who kills a man kills a man

the man who kills himself kills all men

as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world

he rose to his feet and looked down at the knife the knife was jems the blood was his this spot of ground whether he could ever find it again whether he lived to try would be theirs

he turned around to walk to balios towards wales and tessa he did not look back

i would request that my body in death be buried not cremated so that the energy content contained within it gets returned to the earth so that flora and fauna can dine upon it just as i have dined upon flora and fauna during my lifetime

you were born a child of light’s wonderful secret— you return to the beauty you have always been

im fed up to the ears with old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in

some pirates achieved immortality by great deeds of cruelty or derringdo some achieved immortality by amassing great wealth but the captain had long ago decided that he would on the whole prefer to achieve immortality by not dying

no man ever threw away life while it was worth keeping

i have done it again

i manage it

a sort of walking miracle my skin

bright as a nazi lampshade

my right foot

my face a featureless fine

peel off the napkin

o my enemy

do i terrify

the nose the eye pits the full set of teeth

the sour breath

will vanish in a day

soon soon the flesh

the grave cave ate will be

at home on me

and i a smiling woman

i am only thirty

and like the cat i have nine times to die

this is number three

what a trash

to annihilate each decade

what a million filaments

the peanutcrunching crowd

shoves in to see

them unwrap me hand and foot

the big strip tease

these are my hands

my knees

i may be skin and bone

nevertheless i am the same identical woman

the first time it happened i was ten

it was an accident

the second time i meant

to last it out and not come back at all

as a seashell

they had to call and call

and pick the worms off me like sticky pearls

is an art like everything else

i do it exceptionally well

i do it so it feels like hell

i do it so it feels real

i guess you could say ive a call

its easy enough to do it in a cell

its easy enough to do it and stay put

its the theatrical

to the same place the same face the same brute

that knocks me out

there is a charge

for the eyeing of my scars there is a charge

for the hearing of my heart

it really goes

and there is a charge a very large charge

for a word or a touch

or a bit of blood

or a piece of my hair or my clothes

so so herr doktor

so herr enemy

i am your opus

i am your valuable

the pure gold baby

that melts to a shriek

i turn and burn

do not think i underestimate your great concern

you poke and stir

flesh bone there is nothing there

out of the ash

i rise with my red hair

you will be the first test subject tobias beatrice however she smiles you are too injured to be of much use to me so your execution will occur at the conclusion of this meeting

i try to hide the shudder that goes through me at the word execution my shoulder screaming with pain and look up at tobias its hard to blink tears back when i see the terror in tobiass wide dark eyes

no says tobias his voice trembles but his look stern as he shakes his head i would rather die

im afraid you dont have much of a choice in that matter replies jeanine lightly

you fear to die

its not that i dont want i mean ive alwaysits just that life is a habit thats hard to break

for this moment this one moment we are together i press you to me come pain feed on me bury your fangs in my flesh tear me asunder i sob i sob

but when ye come and all the flowers are dying

if i am dead as dead i well may be

youll come and find the place where i am lying

and kneel and say ave there for me

and i shall hear though soft you tread above me

and all my grave will warmer sweeter be

for you will bend and tell me that you love me

and i shall sleep in peace until you come to me

weve got a problem snape said the lumpy amycus whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon dumbledore the boy doesnt seem able

but somebody else had spoken snapes name quite softly

the sound frightened harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening for the first time dumbledore was pleading

snape said nothing but walked forwards and pushed malfoy roughly out of the way the three death eaters fell back without a word even the werewolf seemed cowed

snape gazed for a moment at dumbledore and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face

snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at dumbledore avada kedavra

will having a newborn distract from the time we have together she asked dont you think saying goodbye to your child will make your death more painful

wouldnt it be great if it did i said lucy and i both felt that life wasnt about avoiding suffering

i keep finding myself stifled by the company of others and then crippled by loneliness when i leave them i am terrified and i dont even know of what because i have lost everything already

he what’s the matter with you

before i go he said and paused  i may kiss her

i saw the world from the stars point of view and it looked unbearably lonely

who wants flowers when youre dead nobody

the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated

it was a year for the ages like  like  to name just a few forget the scythe goddamn it i needed a broom or a mop and i needed a vacation

i wonder if thats how darkness wins by convincing us to trap it inside ourselves instead of emptying it out

i dont want it to win

the fact that life has no meaning is a reason to live moreover the only one

perfection of character is this to live each day as if it were your last without frenzy without apathy without pretence

man cannot possess anything as long as he fears death but to him who does not fear it everything belongs if there was no suffering man would not know his limits would not know himself

honor from death i snap is a myth invented by the war torn to make sense of the horrific if we die it will be so that others may live truly honorable death the only honorable death is one that enables life

i will not let her speak because i love her and when you love someone you do not make them tell war stories a war story is a black space on the one side is before and on the other side is after and what is inside belongs only to the dead

of all the wonders that i have heard

it seems to me most strange that men should fear

will come when it will come

the connections we make in the course of a lifemaybe thats what heaven is

since you ask most days i cannot remember

i walk in my clothing unmarked by that voyage

then the almost unnameable lust returns

even then i have nothing against life

i know well the grass blades you mention

the furniture you have placed under the sun

but suicides have a special language

like carpenters they want to know which tools

they never ask why build

twice i have so simply declared myself

have possessed the enemy eaten the enemy

have taken on his craft his magic

in this way heavy and thoughtful

warmer than oil or water

i have rested drooling at the mouthhole

i did not think of my body at needle point

even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone

suicides have already betrayed the body

stillborn they dont always die

but dazzled they cant forget a drug so sweet

that even children would look on and smile

to thrust all that life under your tongue—

that all by itself becomes a passion

deaths a sad bone bruised youd say

and yet she waits for me year after year

to so delicately undo an old wound

to empty my breath from its bad prison

balanced there suicides sometimes meet

raging at the fruit a pumpedup moon

leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss

leaving the page of the book carelessly open

something unsaid the phone off the hook

and the love whatever it was an infection

it never gets easier missing you and sometimes i wonder if it ever will

i dont hold with cruelty to cats

i love you every day and now i will miss you every day

the dead could only speak through the mouths of those left behind and through the signs they left scattered behind them

stuffed deer heads on walls are bad enough but it’s worse when you see them wearing dark glasses having streamers around their necks and a hat on their antlers because then you know they were enjoying themselves at a party when they were shot

regret is mostly caused by not having

no’ nico said ‘getting a second life is one thing making it a better life that’s the trick’ as soon as he said it nico realized he could’ve been talking about himself he decided not to bring that up

each time we dont say what we wanna say were dying

oh brothers i dont care for brothers my elder brother wont die and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else

last words are always harder to remember when no one knows that someones about to die

for in grief nothing stays put one keeps on emerging from a phase but it always recurs round and round everything repeats am i going in circles or dare i hope i am on a spiral

but if a spiral am i going up or down it

how often  will it be for always  how often will the vast emptiness astonish me like a complete novelty and make me say i never realized my loss till this moment the same leg is cut off time after time

the thought that i might kill myself formed in my mind coolly as a tree or a flower

i used to think i knew everything i was a smart person who got things done and because of that the higher i climbed the more i could look down and scoff at what seemed silly or simple even religion

o here

will i set up my everlasting rest

and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars

from this worldwearied flesh eyes look your last

arms take your last embrace and lips o you

the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss

a dateless bargain to engrossing death

finally there is nothing here for death to take away

here is a small fact

you are going to die

if after i die people want to write my biography there is nothing simpler they only need two dates the date of my birth and the date of my death between one and another every day is mine

whether we like it or not the one justification for the existence of all religions is death they need death as much as we need bread to eat

death is unstoppable one must face it as a fact of life

every poem should remind the reader that they are going to die

now i am become death the destroyer of worlds

you are afraid to die and you’re afraid to live what a way to exist

you cant give her that she screamed its not safe

its a sword said the hogfather theyre not meant to be safe

shes a child shouted crumley

its educational

what if she cuts herself

that will be an important lesson

death twitches my ear

live he says

im coming

true nervous very very dreadfully nervous i had been and am but why will say that i am mad the disease had sharpened my senses not destroyed not dulled them above all was the sense of hearing acute

criminals do not die by the hands of the law they die by the hands of other men

there is no such thing as inner peace there is only nervousness and death

of all the ways to lose a person death is the kindest

everybody know death is inevitably coming but it never fails to catch everybody by surprise everytime one is going

i have stitched life into me like a rare organ

from three women a poem for three voices written

its all gods will you can die in your sleep and god can spare you in battle

yer a good lad atticus mowin’ me lawn and killin’ what brits come around

its easy to cry when you realize that everyone you love will reject you or die

if after i depart this vale you ever remember me and have thought to please my ghost forgive some sinner and wink your eye at some homely girl

no sense of the irony of human experience that we are the highest form of life on earth and yet ineffably sad because we know what no other animal knows that we must die

i am almost a hundred years old waiting for the end and thinking about the beginning

there are things i need to tell you but would you listen if i told you how quickly time passes

i know you are unable to imagine this

i know i wrote letters to people with no address on this earth i know that you are dead but i hear you i hear all of you we were here our lives matter

sometimes i think gravity may be death in disguise other times i think gravity is love which is why loves only demand is that we fall

end no the journey doesnt end here death is just another path one that we all must take

grief reunites you with what youve lost its a merging you go with the loved thing or person thats going away you follow it a far as you can go

but finallythe grief goes away and you phase back into the world without him

death is the fairest thing in the world no ones ever gotten out of it the earth takes everyone  the kind the cruel the sinners aside from that theres no fairness on earth

i wonder if ill ever have to decide which is worse life as were living or no life at all

he said that we belonged together because he was born with a flower and i was born with a butterfly and that flowers and butterflies need each other for survival

i am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground

so it is and so it will be for so it has been time out of mind

into the darkness they go the wise and the lovely crowned

with lilies and with laurel they go but i am not resigned

lovers and thinkers into the earth with you

be one with the dull the indiscriminate dust

a fragment of what you felt of what you knew

a formula a phrase remains—but the best is lost

the answers quick and keen the honest look the laughter the love—

they are gone they are gone to feed the roses elegant and curled

is the blossom fragrant is the blossom i know but i do not approve

more precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world

down down down into the darkness of the grave

gently they go the beautiful the tender the kind

quietly they go the intelligent the witty the brave

i know but i do not approve and i am not resigned

life is a spark between two identical voids the darkness before birth and the one after death

without dreams i have to be content with my own imagination– which is almost as good i can picture all of those things perfectly as well as how itll be when i take your life from this world

life is a sexually transmitted disease and the mortality rate is one hundred percent

it’s not contagious you know death is as natural as life it’s part of the deal we made

no matter what i want to continue living with the awareness that i will die without that i am not alive

when it comes to death we know that laughter and tears are pretty much the same thing

and so laughing and crying we said goodbye to my grandmother and when we said goodbye to one grandmother we said goodbye to all of them

each funeral was a funeral for all of us

we lived and died together

all of us laughed when they lowered my grandmother into the ground

and all of us laughed when they covered her with dirt

and all of us laughed as we walked and drove and rode our way back to our lonely lonely houses

tell me what it is like to die i answered

he dismounted from his horse looking at me strangely the whole while you experience something similar every day he said softly it is as familiar to you as bread and butter

yes i said it is like every night when i fall asleep

no it is like every morning when you wake up

im going to die whatever you do but im not afraid

death didnt bother me much strong christian and all that method of death did being eaten alive one of my top three ways not to go out

i wish the dayd begin

i wish it would rain or snow

or the wind would blow

or the grass would grow

i wish i had yesterday

i wish there were games to play

two turtle doves will show thee

where my cold ashes lie

and sadly murmuring tell thee

how in tears i did die

snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at dumbledore

but i dont know what to him about the aftermath of killing a person about how they never leave you

did you get notes for me

no ronan repliedi thought you were dead in a ditch

dont wake me for the end of the world unless it has very good special effects

conscience is no more than the dead speaking to us

it is love not reason that is stronger than death

so have a little fun soon enough youll be dead and burning in hell with the rest of your family

kill me or you are a murderer

in a world where death is the hunter my friend there is no time for regrets or doubts there is only time for decisions

darkling i listen and for many a time

i have been half in love with easeful death

calld him soft names in many a musèd rhyme

to take into the air my quiet breath

now more than ever seems it rich to die

to cease upon the midnight with no pain

while thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad

in such an ecstasy

you can’t go back ever you can’t change the past it just is    this is our destiny not yours

when the time comes to die make sure that all you have to do is die

put a gun to my head and paint the wall with my brains

summertime is always the best of what might be

whatever happens to your body your soul will survive untouched

the life you have left is a gift cherish it enjoy it now to the fullest do what matters now

death is contagious it is contracted the moment we are conceived

if you die in an elevator be sure to push the up button

i know that its easier to look at death than it is to look at pain because while death is irrevocable and the grief will lessen in time pain is too often merely relentless and irreversible

i’ll never speak to god again

many have died you also will die the drum of death is being beaten the world has fallen in love with a dream only sayings of the wise will remain

well id certainly hate to interrupt your pleasant night stroll with my sudden death

death does not concern us because as long as we exist death is not here and when it does come we no longer exist

i always knew on some level that i wouldnt live long its simply not written in my stars

why should i fear death

if i am then death is not

if death is then i am not

why should i fear that which can only exist when i do not

religious tyranny did domineer

at length the mighty one of greece

began to assent the liberty of man

and i put my hand on her arm to stop her rowing

aaron’s noise roars up in red and black

the current takes us on

i’m sorry i cry as the river takes us away my words ragged things torn from me my chest pulled so tight i can’t barely breathe i’m sorry manchee

todd he barks confused and scared and watching me leave him behind todd

aaron brings his free hand towards my dog

and aaron wrenches his arms and there’s a crack and a scream and a cutoff yelp that tears my heart in two forever and forever

and the pain is too much it’s too much it’s too much and my hands are on my head and i’m rearing back and my mouth is open in a neverending wordless wail of all the blackness that’s inside of me

you cant have living without dying so you cant call it living what we got we just are we just be like rocks beside the road

i work all day and get halfdrunk at night

waking at four to soundless dark i stare

in time the curtainedges will grow light

till then i see whats really always there

unresting death a whole day nearer now

making all thought impossible but how

and where and when i shall myself die

arid interrogation yet the dread

of dying and being dead

flashes afresh to hold and horrify

the mind blanks at the glare not in remorse

the good not done the love not given time

torn off unused  nor wretchedly because

an only life can take so long to climb

clear of its wrong beginnings and may never

but at the total emptiness for ever

the sure extinction that we travel to

and shall be lost in always not to be here

not to be anywhere

and soon nothing more terrible nothing more true

this is a special way of being afraid

no trick dispels religion used to try

that vast motheaten musical brocade

created to pretend we never die

and specious stuff that says no rational being

can fear a thing it will not feel not seeing

that this is what we fear  no sight no sound

no touch or taste or smell nothing to think with

nothing to love or link with

the anasthetic from which none come round

and so it stays just on the edge of vision

that slows each impulse down to indecision

most things may never happen this one will

and realisation of it rages out

in furnacefear when we are caught without

people or drink courage is no good

it means not scaring others being brave

lets no one off the grave

death is no different whined at than withstood

slowly light strengthens and the room takes shape

it stands plain as a wardrobe what we know

have always known know that we cant escape

yet cant accept one side will have to go

meanwhile telephones crouch getting ready to ring

in lockedup offices and all the uncaring

intricate rented world begins to rouse

the sky is white as clay with no sun

work has to be done

postmen like doctors go from house to house

the times literary supplement december

what separates us from the animals what separates us from the chaos is our ability to mourn people we’ve never met

the worst thing he told me

is bitterness people end up so

life is fragile and temporary the faces of today quickly become the faces of the past sorrow pain and anger it all fades

except love love is forever and there after even when weve fallen to our graves

my favourite piece of information is that branwell brontë brother of emily and charlotte died standing up leaning against a mantle piece in order to prove it could be done

this is not quite true in fact my absolute favourite piece of information is the fact that young sloths are so inept that they frequently grab their own arms and legs instead of tree limbs and fall out of trees

people who get up early in the morning cause war death and famine

when the first living thing existed i was there waiting when the last living thing dies my job will be finished ill put the chairs on the tables turn out the lights and lock the universe behind me when i leave

ive got death inside me its just a question of whether or not i can outlive it

anyway im sort of glad theyve got the atomic bomb invented if theres ever another war im going to sit right the hell on top of it ill volunteer for it i swear to god i will

we do not need to grieve for the dead why should we grieve for them they are now in a place where there is no more shadow darkness loneliness isolation or pain they are home

dying should come easy

like a freight train you

dont hear when

your back is

dead people can be our heroes because they cant disappoint us later they only improve over time as we forget more and more about them

youll forget it when youre dead and so will i when im dead im going to forget everything–and i advise you to do the same

were not words henry were people

words are how others define us but we can define ourselves any way we choose

were standing here beat to shit walking away from a crime scene where either or both of us could have bought it and youre asking me to marry you

everyone sounded the same when they died

oh lestat you deserved everything thats ever happened to you you better not die you might actually go to hell

here i am trying to live or rather i am trying to teach the death within me how to live

not forever does the bulbul sing

not forever lasts the spring

nor ever blossom the flowers

not forever reigneth joy

sets the sun on days of bliss

friendships not forever last

they know not life who know not this

believe me when you die its everybody elses but your problem

grief is like the ocean it comes on waves ebbing and flowing sometimes the water is calm and sometimes it is overwhelming all we can do is learn to swim

and then i did what i had never done in his presence much less in his arms i cried

its all right tessa you can go we love you you can go now

why are you saying that

she might need permission to die cal

i dont want her to she doesnt have my permission

when the body escaped mutilation seldom did the heart go to the grave unscarred

a halo surrounded the grim reaper nun sister maria by the wayi like this human idea of the grim reaper i like the scythe it amuses me

death walks faster than the wind and never returns what he has taken

we cannot after all judge a biography by its length by the number of pages in it we must judge by the richness of the contentssometimes the unfinisheds are among the most beautiful symphonies

above all i have been a sentient being a thinking animal on this beautiful planet and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure

i held her close for only a short time but after she was gone id see her smile on the face of a perfect stranger and i knew she would be there with me all the rest of my days

those who shun the whimsy of things will experience rigor mortis before death

about here she thought dabbling her fingers in the water a ship had sunk and she muttered dreamily half asleep how we perished each alone

any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bells tolls it tolls for thee

the only sin is the sin of being born

things change after you die though i guess because dying is the loneliest thing you can do

can you do it when the time comes when the time comes there will be no time now is the time curse god and die

leonard asks me if theres anything i need to know before he dies i think about it for a minute turn to him say whats the meaning of life leonard he laughs says thats an easy one my son its whatever you want it to be

if this continues if this goes on then when i die your memories of me will be my greatest accomplishment you memories will be my most lasting impressions

and you know theres less charm in life when you think about deathbut its more peaceful

absence is a house so vast that inside you will pass through its walls and hang pictures on the air

there is one who remembers the way to your door life you may evade but death you shall not

who wants flowers when youre dead nobody

no i regret nothing all i regret is having been born dying is such a long tiresome business i always found

i died for beauty but was scarce

adjusted in the tomb

when one who died for truth was lain

in an adjoining room

he questioned softly why i failed

and i for truth—the two are one

we brethren are he said

and so as kinsmen met a night

we talked between the rooms

until the moss had reached our lips

and covered up our names

they say even death cant cure an idiot

is today a good day to die

what will survive of us is love

from a writer

i am still in the land of the dying i shall be in the land of the living soon his last words

are those real islands asked the young prince

of course they are real islands said the man in evening dress

and those strange and troubling creatures

they are all genuine and authentic princesses

then god must exist cried the prince

i am god replied the man in full evening dress with a bow

the young prince returned home as quickly as he could

so you are back said the father the king

i have seen islands i have seen princesses i have seen god said the prince reproachfully

the king was unmoved

neither real islands nor real princesses i have seen god said the prince reproachfully

the king was unmoved

neither real islands nor real princesses nor a real god exist

i saw them

tell me how god was dressed

were the sleeves of his coat rolled back

the prince remembered that they had been the king smiled

that is the uniform of a magician you have been deceived

at this the prince returned to the next land and went to the same shore where once again he came upon the man in full evening dress

my father the king has told me who you are said the young prince indignantly you deceived me last time but not again now i know that those are not real islands and real princesses because you are a magician

the man on the shore smiled

it is you who are deceived my boy in your fathers kingdom there are many islands and many princesses but you are under your fathers spell so you cannot see them

the prince pensively returned home when he saw his father he looked him in the eyes

father is it true that you are not a real king but only a magician

the king smiled and rolled back his sleeves

yes my son i am only a magician

then the man on the shore was god

the man on the shore was another magician

i must know the real truth the truth beyond magic

there is no truth beyond magic said the king

the prince was full of sadness

he said i will kill myself

the king by magic caused death to appear death stood in the door and beckoned to the prince the prince shuddered he remembered the beautiful but unreal islands and the unreal but beautiful princesses

very well he said i can bear it

you see my son said the king you too now begin to be a magician

when was it i realized that on this truly dark and solitary path we all walk the only way we can light is our own although i was raised with love i was always lonely

someday without fail everyone will disappear scattered into the blackness of time

how terrible said eragon to die alone separate even from the one who is closest to you

everyone dies alone eragon whether you are a king on a battlefield or a lowly peasant lying in bed among your family no one can accompany you into the void

it was impossible to read expression in azraels features

death glanced sideways at the servants

lord what can the harvest hope for if not for the care of the reaper man

one to be a murderer one to be a martyr one to be a monarch one to go mad

death be not proud

death be not proud though some have called thee

mighty and dreadful for thou art not so

for those whom thou thinkst thou dost overthrow

die not poor death nor yet canst thou kill me

from rest and sleep which but thy pictures be

much pleasure then from thee much more must flow

and soonest our best men with thee do go

rest of their bones and souls delivery

thourt slave to fate chance kings and desperate men

and dost with poison war and sickness dwell

and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well

and better than thy stroke  why swellst thou then

one short sleep past we wake eternally

and death shall be no more death thou shalt die

no more let life divide what death can join together

would you give up your vengeance against someone you hate if it meant saving someone you love would you want your dreams to come true if it meant granting your enemys dying wish

there are always two deaths the real one and the one people know about

dead never been that before not even once

until death it is all life

the main facts in human life are five birth food sleep love and death

and there you have it another body on the floor surrounded by things that dont mean much to anyone except to the one who cant take any of them along

to whom could i put this question with any hope of an answer does being able to live without someone you loved mean you loved her less than you thought

what happens if you get scared half to death twice

they give birth astride of a grave the light gleams an instant then its night once more

tell me doctor are you afraid of death

i guess it depends on how you die

you should read something else

why would he have done that to him

i dont know she said

do you ever feel like job

she smiled a little twinkle in her eyes

but you havent lost your faith

no i knew she hadnt but i think i was losing mine

is it because you think you might get better

no she saidits because its the only thing i have left

the death of dogma is the birth of morality

what will i be doing in twenty years time ill be dead darling are you crazy

some things are private some things needed to be said even when the person who needed to hear them couldn’t hear anything ever again

the only certainty life contains is death

please give your

bodies and your

to

who

deserve them

there is

no way

the

you would bring

and

i wish you

and

out

but not

you

you start dying slowly

if you do not travel

if you do not read

if you do not listen to the sounds of life

if you do not appreciate yourself

you start dying slowly

when you kill your selfesteem

when you do not let others help you

you start dying slowly

if you become a slave of your habits

walking everyday on the same paths…

if you do not change your routine

if you do not wear different colours

or you do not speak to those you don’t know

you start dying slowly

if you avoid to feel passion

and their turbulent emotions

those which make your eyes glisten

and your heart beat fast

you start dying slowly

if you do not change your life when you are not satisfied with your job or with your love

if you do not risk what is safe for the uncertain

if you do not go after a dream

if you do not allow yourself

at least once in your lifetime

to run away from sensible advice

merciful death how you love your precious guilt

life is both sad and solemn we are led into a wonderful world we meet one another here greet each other  and wander together for a brief moment then we lose each other and disappear as suddenly and unreasonably as we arrived

were reaching for death

on the end of a candle

were trying for something

thats already found us

he cries please i dont want to die

i lean over my hair smothers him

then you should never have been born i say

and death spoke to them —’

sorry interjected harry but death spoke to them

it’s a fairy tale harry

time doesn’t heal all wounds we both know that’s bullshit it comes from people who have nothing comforting or original to say

we took such care of tomorrow but died on the way there

this is a long goodbye yet not time enough i have no aptitude for this i cannot learn this i would hold on and hold on until my hands clutch at emptiness

i bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass i love

if you want me again look for me under your bootsoles

you will hardly know who i am or what i mean

but i shall be good health to you nonetheless

and filter and fibre your blood

they never fail who die in a great cause

i learned that from a program on the national geographic channel so i believe it is true not all dogs return as men they say only those who are ready

i am ready

our life is made by the death of others

endings are not always bad most times theyre just beginnings in disguise

and in what fairy tale would john ever be any sane persons idea of prince charming anyway he was the opposite of charming more like prince terrifying

some men die for lack of love…some die because of it think about it  daemon

i write and that way rid myself of me and then at last i can rest

once you are born in this world you’re old enough to die

saving you

the darkness takes him over

the sickness pulls him in

his eyes—a blown out candle

i wish to go with him

sometimes i see a flicker—

a light that shone from them

i hold him to me tightly

before hes gone again

to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever

how do you mourn something that never really belonged to you

you will have five hundred million little bells and i shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water

nobody heard him the dead man

but still he lay moaning

i was much further out than you thought

and not waving but drowning

poor chap he always loved larking

and now hes dead

it must have been too cold for him his heart gave way

they said

oh no no no it was too cold always

still the dead one lay moaning

i was much too far out all my life

and not waving but drowning

not waving but drowning

our love was a twoperson game at least until one of us died and the other became a murderer

just because butterflies lives were short didnt mean they were tragic see they have a beautiful life

plants are more courageous than almost all human beings an orange tree would rather die than produce lemons whereas instead of dying the average person would rather be someone they are not

death must exist for life to have meaning

the only true borders lie between day and night between life and death between hope and loss

im wishing he could see that music lives forever that its stronger than death stronger than time and that its strength holds you together when nothing else can

to be heroic is to be courageous enough to die for something to be inspirational is to be crazy enough to live a little

and we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief

sadly enough the most painful goodbyes are the ones that are left unsaid and never explained

that is — your friend

philtatos achilles replied sharply most beloved

we all didnt come into to the world at the same time so it makes sense that we dont leave it at the same time

this world

that was our home

for a brief spell

but pain and grief

its a shame that not one of our problems

we depart

with a thousand regrets

in our hearts

because you can only die once but you can suffer forever

we have only a little time to please the living but all eternity to love the dead

i have always been afraid always been pretending to follow you closely alwyas been pretending to sharpen my teeth when the truth is i am  scared to death just treading on your shadow

you only get one life live it to the fullest all your miseries will be forgiven when you will be dead

one false step and you’ll fall all the way to tartarus—and believe me unlike the doors of death this would be a oneway trip a very hard fall i will not have you dying before you tell me your plan for my artwork

nox didn’t say a word he waited counting the seconds in his mind sometimes you counted bullets and sometimes you counted time either one could kill you

thats all you can do in this world no matter how strong the current beats against you or how heavy your burden or how tragic your love story you keep going

but on paper things can live forever

remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose

the cries of the dead are terrible indeed you should try not to hear them

mens lives have meaning not their deaths

jon snow is this a proper castle now not just a tower

it is jon took her hand

good she whispered i wanted t’ see one proper castle before … before i …

she just smiled at that d’you remember that cave we should have stayed in that cave i told you so

we’ll go back to the cave he said you’re not going to die ygritte you’re not

oh ygritte cupped his cheek with her hand you know nothing jon snow she sighed dying

was there ever a war where only one side bled

be of good cheer about death and know this of a truth that no evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death

i have given my word that only death will take me from you

as for gussie finknottle many an experienced undertaker would have been deceived by his appearance and started embalming on sight

to continue believing in yourself believing in the doctors believing in the treatment believing in whatever i chose to believe in that was the most important thing i decided it had to be

so i believed

it was the meanest moment of eternity

one of the inescapable encumbrances of leading an interesting life is that there have to be moments when you almost lose it

i was not i was i am not i care not non fui fui non sum non curo

oh threats of hell and hopes of paradise

one thing at least is certain  this life flies

one thing is certain and the rest is lies

the flower that once has blown forever dies

death is part of who we are it guides

us it shapes us it drives us to madness can you still be human if you have no mortal end

what am i dying for

live or die but dont poison everything

mad eye moody on the avada kedavra curse not nice he said calmly not pleasant and theres no counter curse theres no blocking it only one known person has ever survived it and hes sitting right in front of me

thats a nice song said young sam and vimes remembered that he was hearing it for the first time

its an old soldiers song he said

really sarge but its about angels

yes thought vimes and its amazing what bits those angels cause to rise up as the song progresses its a real soldiers song sentimental with dirty bits

as i recall they used to sing it after battles he said ive seen old men cry when they sing it he added

why it sounds cheerful

they were remembering who they were not singing it with thought vimes youll learn i know you will

its better to burn out than to fade away

pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living

if you cannot love me i will die before you came i wanted to die i have told you many times it is cruel to have made me want to live only to make my death more bloody

an angel girl with an upturned face

a name is written on a polished rock

a broken heart that the world forgot

farewell is said by the living in life every day it is said with love and friendship with the affirmation that the memories are lasting if the flesh is not

that time of year thou mayst in me behold

when yellow leaves or none or few do hang

upon those boughs which shake against the cold

bare ruind choirs where late the sweet birds sang

in me thou seest the twilight of such day

as after sunset fadeth in the west

which by and by black night doth take away

deaths second self that seals up all in rest

in me thou seest the glowing of such fire

that on the ashes of his youth doth lie

as the deathbed whereon it must expire

consumed with that which it was nourishd by

this thou perceivest which makes thy love more strong

to love that well which thou must leave ere long

would it hurt to die all those times he had thought it was about to happen and escaped he had never really thought of the thing itself his will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death

for a word to be spoken there must be silence before and after

by daily dying i have come to be

death especially violent death will turn the meanest bastard in the world into a nice guy why is that

death was standing behind a lectern poring over a map he looked at mort as if he wasn’t entirely there

yᴏᴜ ʜᴀᴠᴇɴᴛ ʜᴇᴀʀᴅ ᴏғ ᴛʜᴇ bᴀʏ oғ mᴀɴᴛᴇ ʜᴀᴠᴇ ʏᴏᴜ he said

no sir said mort

was there

my mother gets dressed

it is impossible for my mother to do even

the simplest things for herself anymore

so we do it together

i choose the clothes without

zippers or buckles or straps

clothes that are simple

but elegant and easy to get into

otherwise its just like every other day

after bathing getting dressed

the stockings go on first

this time its the new ones

the special ones with opaque black triangles

that shes never worn before

bought just two weeks ago

we start with the heavy careful stuff of the right toes

into the stocking tip

then a smooth yank past the knob of her ankle

and over her cool smooth calf

then the other toe

up the legs

and the pantyhose is coaxed to her waist

youre doing great mom

as we ease her body

against mine rest her whole weight against me

to slide her black dress

with the black empire collar

struggle her fingers through the dark tunnel of the sleeve

i reach from the outside

deep into the dark for her hand

grasp where i cant see for her touch

youve got to help me a little here mom

and we work her fingers through the sleeves mouth

together then we rest her weight against me

before threading the other fingers wrist forearm elbow bicep

and now over the head

i gentle the black dress over her breasts

thighs bring her makeup to her

put some color on her skin

shes ready for her company

i tell the two women in simple elegant suits

waiting outside the bedroom come in

they tell me shes beautiful

yes she is i tell them

i leave as they carefully

zip her into

the black body bag

i dream a large green

when i unzip it

my mother is inside

her eyeshadow which matches

the suitcase

perfectly shes wearing

im here she says smiling delightedly waving

and i wake up

four days later she comes home

that is heavier than it looks

in the middle of a meadow

i learn a naked

more than naked

i learn a new way to hug

as i tighten my fist

my hand filled with her ashes

and the small stones of bones

then open my hand

and release her

into the smallest hottest sun

a dandelion screaming yellow at the sky

death why all this fuss about death use your imagination try to visualize a world without death death is the essential condition to life not an evil

when we were kids

laying around the lawn

on our

we often talked

about

how

wed like to

and

we all

agreed on the

same

wed all

done any

and now

that

we are hardly

any longer

we think more

about

how

not to

and

were

most of

prefer to

do it

under the

now

that

most of

our lives

i thought of you and how you love this beauty

and walking up the long beach all alone

i heard the waves breaking in measured thunder

as you and i once heard their monotone

around me were the echoing dunes beyond me

the cold and sparkling silver of the sea

we two will pass through death and ages lengthen

before you hear that sound again with me

no one escapes from life alive

on the death of a friend we should consider that the fates through confidence have devolved on us the task of a double living that we have henceforth to fulfill the promise of our friends life also in our own to the world

rosencrantz we might as well be dead do you think death could possibly be a boat

guildenstern no no no death isnot death isnt you take my meaning death is the ultimate negative notbeing you cant notbe on a boat

rosencrantz ive frequently not been on boats

guildenstern no no nowhat youve been is not on boats

eyes look your last

arms take your last embrace

and lips oh you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death

knockkneed coughing like hags we cursed through sludge

till on the haunting flares we turned our backs

and towards our distant rest began to trudge

but limped on bloodshod all went lame all blind

drunk with fatigue deaf even to the hoots

of disappointed shells that dropped behind

gas gas quick boys an ecstasy of fumbling

fitting the clumsy helmets just in time

but someone still was yelling out and stumbling

and floundering like a man in fire or lime

dim through the misty panes and thick green light

as under a green sea i saw him drowning

in all my dreams before my helpless sight

he plunges at me guttering choking drowning

if in some smothering dreams you too could pace

behind the wagon that we flung him in

and watch the white eyes writhing in his face

his hanging face like a devils sick of sin

if you could hear at every jolt the blood

come gargling from the frothcorrupted lungs

obscene as cancer bitter as the cud

my friend you would not tell with such high zest

to children ardent for some desperate glory

the power of the dead is that we think they see us all the time the dead have a presence is there a level of energy composed solely of the dead they are also in the ground of course asleep and crumbling perhaps we are what they dream

i didnt tell him that the diagnosis came three months after i got my first period like congratulations youre a woman now die

arent you afraid of dying

not really ive watched lots of goodfornothing worthless people die and if people like that can do it then i should be able to handle it

and i could have died right then and considering how things went i really should have

lord help my poor soul

you know lieutenant you wear your weapon the way other women wear pearls

its not a fashion accessory

how unhappy does one have to be before living seems worse than dying

he never sleeps the judge he is dancing dancing he says that he will never die

this time it is real — all must die and where could mountaineer find a more glorious death

in reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other men or rather other men are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled

no drowning man can know which drop

of water his last breath did stop

flowers that grow where old ones have withered serve to remind us that death will one day come to us all

vibrates in the memory

odours when sweet violets sicken

live within the sense they quicken

rose leaves when the rose is dead

are heapd for the belovèds bed

and so thy thoughts when thou art gone

love itself shall slumber on

i’ve never once thought about how i was going to die she said i can’t think about it i don’t even know how i’m going to live

man is literally split in two he has an awareness of his own splendid uniqueness in that he sticks out of nature with a towering majesty and yet he goes back into the ground a few feet in order blindly and dumbly to rot and disappear forever

those were strange days now that i look back at them in the midst of life everything revolved around death

because no one needs to live for ever i think that sometimes you can outstay your welcome

having nothing to struggle

against

they have nothing to struggle

of his bones are coral made

those are pearls that were his eyes

nothing of him that doth fade

but doth suffer a seachange

into something rich and strange

seanymphs hourly ring his knell dingdong

hark now i hear them—dingdong bell

i was born when you kissed me i died when you left me i lived a few weeks while you loved me

he would reach for me in the middle of the night nearly every single night wrapping one of those solid arms around my waist and pulling me in close so close

i do not cling to life sufficiently to fear death

what i fear most i think is the death of the imagination

for to fear death my friends is only to think ourselves wise without really being wise for it is to think that we know what we do not know for no one knows whether death may not be the greatest good that can happen to man

how many times can a heart be shattered and still be pieced back together how many times before the damage is irreparable

whenever i see an ambulance i like to think there is a baby being born rather than a death

he said you were the only one who was bitter about ss suicide and the only one who really forgave him for it the rest of us he said were outwardly unbitter and inwardly unforgiving

death doesnt care about personalities  hes more interested in meeting quotas

i thought of the people before me who had looked down at the river and gone to sleep beneath it i wondered about them i wondered how they had done itit the physical act

i simply wondered about the dead because their days had ended and i did not know how i would get through mine

i could just remember how my father used to say that the reason for living was to get ready to stay dead a long time

life is a slope as long as youre going up youre always looking towards the top and you feel happy but when you reach it suddenly you can see the road going downhill and death at the end of it all its slow going up and quick going down

the dead are way more organized than the living

one dies only if hes not anymore in the hearts and minds of those who know him

monkey d luffy

i planned my death carefully unlike my life which meandered along from one thing to another despite my feeble attempts to control it

a tragedy need not have blood and death its enough that it all be filled with that majestic sadness that is the pleasure of tragedy

we see a hearse we think sorrow we see a grave we think despair we hear of a death we think of a loss not so in heaven when heaven sees a breathless body it sees the vacated cocoon  the liberated butterfly

i pity you all most of you will diescratch thatall of you

do you understand what im saying

shouted moist you cant just go around killing people

why not you do the golem lowered his arm

what snapped moist i do not who told you that

i worked it out you have killed two point three three eight people said the golem calmly

i have never laid a finger on anyone in my life mr pump i may be–– all the things you know i am but i am not a killer i have never so much as drawn a sword

our honeymoon will shine our life long its beams will only fade over your grave or mine

someone once said that death is not the greatest loss in life the greatest loss is what dies inside of us while we live i could tell you who said it but who the hell really cares

but a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being nor can the dead ever be brought back to life

i am death i come quickly i come slowly but i am not cheated

tell your friend that in his death a part of you dies and goes with him wherever he goes you also go he will not be alone

life isnt fair a fairs a place where you eat corn dogs and ride the ferris wheel

i was thinking about how people seem to read the bible a lot more as they get older and then it dawned on me—they’re cramming for their final exam

i die but when the grave shall press

the heart so long endeared to thee

when earthy cares no more distress

and earthy joys are nought to me

weep not but think that i have past

before thee oer the sea of gloom

have anchored safe and rest at last

where tears and mouring can not come

tis i should weep to leave thee here

on that dark ocean sailing drear

with storms around and fears before

and no kind light to point the shore

but long or short though life may be

tis nothing to eternity

we part below to meet on high

do not act as if you had ten thousand years to throw away death stands at your elbow be good for something while you live and it is in your power

what if shes all i give you in this life of ours my love she asked quietly

then ill shout at the goddess in fury he said fiercely ill beg to know why ive been given so much when other men have so little

in life more than in anything else it isn’t easy to end up alive

killers arent always assassins sometimes they dont even have blood on their hands

shes realized the real problem with stories  if you keep them going long enough they always end in death

the dead do not hurt you only the living do

and the boy whose hair remained the color of lemons forever

death has his favorites like anyone those who are beloved of death will not die

i think people would live a bit longer if they didnt know how old they were age puts restrictions on things

im bored with it all

of course i want to kill you said skulduggery i want to kill most people but then where would i be in a field of dead people with no one to talk to

i could write my name across the sky and it would be in invisible ink

my father chose my name  and my last name was chosen by my ancestors  that’s enough i myself choose my way

i hung myself today hanged whatever

the point is i hanged myself today and i’m still

i feel fine just bored i keep hoping that

someone will come home and cut me down

but then i keep remembering that if i knew

someone like that i wouldn’t be up here bit

ironic right or is that not ironic i read

somewhere that like anything funny is

in some way ironic but i don’t know if its

funny or not i don’t think my brain owns

funny you know

i feel taller i like that

i’ve never been away from my shadow for

this long it had always clung to my feet

parting momentarily for a quick dive into

the swimming pool but never for five

hours i like it there’s three feet of space

between my two and the floor

i wanted something this morning i may be

stuck but at least i’m three feet closer to it

i look back to where my life had been its always risky to think of letting go thats why this is the perfect ending nothing left to reconcile

i said to myself i want to die decently

the rule is that if they have a weapon and want to take you someplace else it is so they can kill you slowerpeter

a man falling off a cliff to certain death will stretch out a hand even to his worst enemy

when i become death death is the seed from which i grow

life is better than death i believe if only because it is less boring and because it has fresh peaches in it

though you may hear me holler

and you may see me cry

ill be dogged sweet baby

if you gonna see me die

remember me when i am gone away

gone far away into the silent land

when you can no more hold me by the hand

nor i half turn to go yet turning stay

remember me when no more day by day

you tell me of our future that you planned

only remember me you understand

it will be late to counsel then or pray

yet if you should forget me for a while

and afterwards remember do not grieve

for if the darkness and corruption leave

a vestige of the thoughts that once i had

better by far you should forget and smile

than that you should remember and be sad

if you wear black then kindly irritating strangers will touch your arm consolingly and inform you that the world keeps on turning

theyre right it does

however much you beg it to stop

it turns and lets grenadine spill over the horizon sends hard bars of gold through my window and i wake up and feel happy for three seconds and then i remember

it turns and tips people out of their beds and into their cars their offices an avalanche of tiny men and women tumbling through life

all trying not to think about whats waiting at the bottom

sometimes it turns and sends us reeling into each others arms we cling tight excited and laughing strangers thrown together on a moving funhouse floor

intoxicated by the motion we forget all the risks

and then the world turns

and somebody falls off

and oh god its such a long way down

numb with shock we can only stand and watch as they fall away from us gradually getting smaller

receding in our memories until theyre no longer visible

we gather in cemeteries tense and silent as if for listening for the impact the splash of a pebble dropped into a dark well trying to measure its depth

trying to measure how far we have to fall

no impact comes no splash the moment passes the world turns and we turn away getting on with our lives

wrapping ourselves in comforting banalities to keep us warm against the cold

times a great healer

at least it was quick

the world keeps turning

alecs dead

it would be wrong to refuse to face the fact that everything is fundamentally sick and sad

so since im still here livin

i guess i will live on

i couldve died for love

but for livin i was born

she diedthis was the way she died

and when her breath was done

took up her simple wardrobe

and started for the sun

her little figure at the gate

the angels must have spied

upon the mortal side

dead we are revealed in our true dimensions and they are surprisingly modest

we all know were going to die whats important is the kind of men and women we are in the face of this

but shes wrong about hell you dont have to wait until youre dead to get there

he could only consider me as the living corpse of a wouldbe suicide a person dead to shame an idiot ghost

what happens if a car comes

stay with me tonight you must see me die i have long had the taste of death on my tongue i smell death and who will stand by my constanze if you do not stay

just as when we come into the world when we die we are afraid of the unknown but the fear is something from within us that has nothing to do with reality dying is like being born just a change

you have made flowers grow where i cultivated dust and stones remember this on this journey you insist on making if you die i will not survive you long

call no man happy said shadow until he is dead

ive told my children that when i die to release balloons in the sky to celebrate that i graduated for me death is a graduation

i never wanted to go away and the hard part now is the leaving you all im not afraid but it seems as if i should be homesick for you even in heaven

one pain is lessened by another’s anguish  take thou some new infection to thy eye and the rank poison of the old will die

it is unfortunate for the gods that unlike us they cannot commit suicide

a dead christ i must do everything for a living christ does everything for me

but hazael only said i brought you a present

liraz took the flower looked at it and then a hazael expressionless and then she ate it she chewed the flower and swallowed it

hmm said hazael not the usual response

oh do you give flowers often

yes he said he probably did hazael had a way of enjoying life in spite of the many restrictions they lived under being soldiers and worse being misbegotten i hope it wasnt poisonous he said lightly

liraz just shrugged there are worse ways to die

in the end living is defined by dying

our knowledge of life is limited to death

michael could never remember his father ever having uttered a word about death as if the don respected death too much to philosophize about it

billy was working on his second letter when the first letter was published the second letter started out like this

and now he was gone

– but here is a question that is troubling me if there is no god then one may ask who governs human life and in general the whole order of things on earth

– man governs it himself – homeless angrily hastened to reply to this admittedly nonetooclear question

usually time alters and affects everything but when someone you love dies time cannot change that no amount of time will ever change that so time stops having any meaning

if no one knows when a person is going to die how can we say he died prematurely

ethan was loyal and funny and protective when we were little he was the brother most likely to make me cry—and mostly likely to wipe away my tears

silence before being born silence after death life is nothing but noise between two unfathomable silences

a girl always remembers the first corpse she shaves

but i was doomed to live

do you remember the sight we saw my soul

that soft summer morning

round a turning in the path

the disgusting carcass on a bed scattered with stones

its legs in the air like a woman in need

burning its wedding poisons

like a fountain with its rhythmic sobs

i could hear it clearly flowing with a long murmuring sound

but i touch my body in vain to find the wound

i am the vampire of my own heart

one of the great outcasts condemned to eternal laughter

who can no longer smile

am i dead

i must be dead

i wish to live to  years old but the day i die i wish it to be with a cigarette in one hand and a glass of whiskey in the other

if life was a dream then dying must be the moment when you woke up it was so simple it must be true you died the dream was over you woke up thats what people meant when they talked about going to heaven it was like waking up

everyone has always said i look like bailey but i dont

i have grey eyes to her green

an oval face to her heartshaped one

im shorter scrawnier paler flatter plainer tamer

all we shared is a madhouse of curls

that i imprison in a ponytail

while she let hers rave

i dont sing in my sleep

or eat the petals off flowers

or run into the rain instead of out of it

im the unpluggedin one

the sidekick sister

tucked into a corner of her shadow

they filled the booths at the restaurant where she waitressed

herded around her at the river

one day i saw a boy come up behind her

and pull a strand of her long hair

i understood this

i felt the same way

she is always looking at the camera

and i am always looking at her

but spending your life concentrating on death is like watching a whole movie and thinking only about the credits that are going to roll at the end it’s a mistake of emphasis

man and woman has an infinite capacity for selfdevelopment equally he has an infinite capacity for selfdestruction a human being may be clinically alive and yet despite all appearances spiritually dead

she had lost all our memories for ever and it was as though by dying she had robbed me of part of myself i was losing my individuality it was the first stage of my own death the memories dropping off like gangrened limbs

i have survived far too much to go quietly

let a meteor take me

call the thunder for backup

my death will be grand

the land will crack

the sun will eat itself

the day i leave

is that what death would feel like the nicest warmest heaviest neverending nap if that’s what it’s like i wouldn’t mind

they say the coward dies many times so does the beloved didnt the eagle find a fresh liver to tear in prometheus every time it dined

nothing is impossible to kill its just that sometimes after you kill something you have to keep shooting it until it stops moving

every day is a lie but you are dying that is not a lie

it was not death she feared it was misunderstanding

sometimes theres nothing you can do  sometimes they dont have enough to fight with

perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops when he loses the power to take in a new idea

sometimes the only answer to death is lunch

shell die

aye thats a consequence of being alive

if they killed him tonight at least he would die alive

for some reason dying men always ask the question they know the answer to perhaps its so they can die being right

my idea of god is not a divine idea it has to be shattered time after time he shatters it himself

but to mourn thats different to mourn is to be eaten alive with homesickness for the person

all good things pass away

my reasons to live

were my reasons to die

but at least they were mine

now ive freedom unbound

cut the laces of life

what will be left of all the fearing and wanting associated with your problematic life situation that every day takes up most of your attention a dash one or two inches long between the date of birth and date of death on your gravestone

there really is only one ending to any story human life ends in death until then it keeps going and gets complicated and theres loss everything involves loss every relationship ends in one way or another

you lived what anybody gets bernie you got a lifetime no more no less

a tomb now suffices him for whom the world was not enough

alexanders tombstone epitaph

as luke knelt down beside his corpse clary couldn’t help but remember what he had said about having loved valentine once about having been his closest friend luke she thought with a pang surely he couldn’t be sad — or even grieved

but then again perhaps everyone should have someone to grieve for them and there was no one else to grieve for valentine

i was diamond on the outside and i would not break

inside though i was already broken

but i’m not guilty said k there’s been a mistake how is it even possible for someone to be guilty we’re all human beings here one like the other that is true said the priest but that is how the guilty speak

im not afraid of death deaths afraid of me

the flower that wilted last year is gone petals once fallen are fallen forever flowers do not return in the spring rather they are replaced it is in this difference between returned and replaced that the price of renewal is paid

and as it is for spring flowers so it is for us

tell him the colonel said smiling that a person doesn’t die when he should but when he can

as ginny and hermione moved closer to the rest of the family harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to fred remus and tonks pale and still and peacefullooking apparently asleep beneath the dark enchanted ceiling

what is this thing you call substance abuse

all i wanna do is forget and get loose

drinking and smoking over and over

whats so great about a life thats sober

theres nothing cool about being young

when the monsters of night have stolen the sun

im tired of searching for words in the sky

all i wanna do is drink and die

nothing is real its all a big lie

all i wanna do is drink and die

theres nothing cool about being young

when the monsters of night have stolen the sun

lets talk of graves of worms and epitaphs

make dust our paper and with rainy eyes

write sorrow on the bosom of the earth

lets choose executors and talk of wills

all through life there were distinctions  toilets for men toilets for women clothes for men clothes for women  then at the end the graves are identical

the cemetery is an open space among the ruins covered in winter with violets and daisies it might make one in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place

if words had weight a single sentence from death would have anchored a ship

dying is only one thing to be sad over living unhappily is something else

here is a list of terrible things

the jaws of sharks a vultures wings

the rabid bite of the dogs of war

the voice of one who went before

but most of all the mirrors gaze

which counts us out our numbered days

when i die dont come i wouldnt want a leaf

to turn away from the sun  it loves it there

theres nothing so spiritual about being happy

but you cant miss a day of it because it doesnt last

if its natural to kill how come men have to go into training to learn how

death a necessary end will come when it will come

he killed himself for wanting to live

we carry the dead with us only until we die too and then it is we who are borne along for a little while and then our bearers in their turn drop and so on into the unimaginable generations

the little things of life sweet and excellent in their place must not be the things lived for the highest must be sought and followed the life of heaven must be begun here on earth

death is easy when youve already tried to find it

was it hard i hope she didnt die hard

sethe shook her head soft as cream being alive was the hard part

i like to imagine that on the day after my last my library and i will crumble together so that even when i am no more ill still be with my books

what do you think has become of the young and old men

and what do you think has become of the women and children

they are alive and well somewhere

the smallest sprout shows there is really no death

and if ever there was it led forward life and does not wait at the

end to arrest it

and ceasd the moment life appeard

all goes onward and outward nothing collapses

and to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier

history is just a way of keeping score but it doesnt have to be who we are

there is some delight in ale and wine

and some in girls with ankles fine

but my delight yes always mine

is to dance with jak o’ the shadows

we will toss the dice however they fall

and snuggle the girls be they short or tall

then follow lord mat whenever he calls

to dance with jak o’ the shadows

what glitters may not be gold and even wolves may smile and fools will be led by promises to their deaths

maybe the only good thing about death is that you never have to relive it you never have to remember the pain

time and death sleep side by side

because i was dying

and then i took it all back because i was scared and confused and conflicted because of adam

warner told me he loved me and in return i insulted him and lied to him and yelled at him and pushed him away and when he had the chance to stand back and watch me die he didn’t

he found a way to save my life

with no demands no expectations believing full well that i was in love with someone else and that saving my life meant making me whole again only to give me back to another guy

and right now i can’t say i know what adam would do if i were dying in front of him i’m not sure if he would save my life and that uncertainty alone makes me certain that something wasnt right between us

the scariest thing in the world is thinking someone you love is going to die

it hurts when theyre gone and it doesnt matter if its slow or fast whether its a long drawnout disease or an unexpected accident when theyre gone the world turns upside down and youre left holding on trying not to fall off

the thing about dead people the thing is you sound like a bastard if you dont romanticize them but the truth is complicated i guess

it was an indulgence learning last words other people had chocolate i had dying declarations

birth and death there was the same consciousness of heightened existence and of her own elevated importance

alive alive in the way that death is alive

death is nature’s way of saying ‘your table is ready

everything needs it bone muscles and even

while it calls the earth its home the soul

so the merciful noisy machine

stands in our house working away in its

lunglike voice i hear it as i kneel

before the fire stirring with a

stick of iron letting the logs

lie more loosely you in the upstairs room

are in your usual position leaning on your

right shoulder which aches

all day you are breathing

patiently it is a

beautiful sound it is

your life which is so close

to my own that i would not know

where to drop the knife of

separation and what does this have to do

with love except

everything now the fire rises

and offers a dozen singing deepred

roses of flame then it settles

to quietude or maybe gratitude as it feeds

as we all do as we must upon the invisible gift

our purest sweet necessity the air

each of us has his own rhythm of suffering

dont look forward to the day you stop suffering because when it comes youll know youre dead

if it means my death i dont care because even death will be a sort of freedom

when you came you cried and everybody smiled with joy when you go smile and let the world cry for you

my father told me once that the most important thing every man should know is what he would die for

at the end of the day your ability to connect with your readers comes down to how you make them feel

death and what came after death was no great mystery to sabriel she just wished it was

when the dead do walk seek waters run

for this the dead will always shun

swift rivers best or broadest lake

to ward the dead and have and make

if water fails thee fires thy friend

if neither guards it will be thy end

my dear

falsely yours

somebody should tell us right at the start of our lives that we are dying then we might live life to the limit every minute of every day do it i say whatever you want to do do it now there are only so many tomorrows

death is only the end if you assume the story is about you

with a hint of good judgment to fear nothing not failure or suffering or even death indicates that you value life the most you live to the extreme you push limits you spend your time building legacies those do not die

how fortunate we were who still had hope i did not then realise i could not know how soon the time would come when we should have no more hope and yet be unable to die

my god if i had a heart i would write my hate on ice and wait for the sun to show

i take no actions that i wouldn’t publicly recount if you can’t speak your deeds then don’t do them

you know how cats do they hide to die dogs come home

i found that the only way i could control this sorrow was not to think of it at all which was almost as painful as the loss itself

if we knew a person was going to die wed hold harder to the memories

fire corrected him in a whisper the good memories

that we shall die

yes theres really only one question that can be answered genry and we already know the answer  the only thing that makes life possible is permanent intolerable uncertainty not knowing what comes next

life is here death is over there i am here not over there

what do you want to do with your life then is often the question im asked

to be honest i dont know i really dont

mainly because i dont see myself living long enough for that to make much of a difference

as long as there are

human beings about

there is never going to be

any peace

for any individual

upon this earth or

they might

escape to

all you can do

here

or maybe an hour

there

is working toward you

right now and

i mean you

and nobody but

you

closure is just as delusiveit is the false hope that we can deaden our living grief

i looked upon the sea it was to be my grave

whatever can die is beautiful — more beautiful than a unicorn who lives forever and who is the most beautiful creature in the world do you understand me

better was it to go unknown and leave behind you an arch then to burn like a meteor and leave no dust

the first kiss can be as terrifying as the last

finnick and i sit for a long time in silence watching the knots bloom and vanish before i can ask how do you bear it

finnick looks at me in disbelief i dont katniss obviously i dont i drag myself out of nightmares each morning and find theres no relief in waking

something in my expression stops him

better not give in to it it takes ten times as long to put yourself together as it does to fall apart

well he must know i take a deep breath forcing myself back into one piece

this is what youth must figure out

girls love and living

the having the not having

the spending and giving

and the meloncholy time of not knowing

this is what age must learn about

the abc of dying

the going yet not going

the loving and leaving

and the unbearable knowing and knowing

everybody has got to die but i have always believed an exception would be made in my case

men die its practically what theyre for

no  no  no someone was shouting no fred no

and percy was shaking his brother and ron was kneeling beside them and freds eyes stared without seeing the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face

the whole life of the individual is nothing but the process of giving birth to himself indeed we should be fully born when we die  although it is the tragic fate of most individuals to die before they are born

as human beings were born believing that we are the apex of creation that we are invincible that no problem exists that we cannot solve but we inevitably die with all our beliefs broken

i must die must i then die lamenting i must be put in chains must i then also lament i must go into exile does any man then hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness and contentment

pain was good if i hurt it meant i wasnt dead

the dead know everything but they dont give a damn

each of the dancers took a partner the living with the dead each to each bod reached out his hand and found himself touching fingers with and gazing into the grey eyes of the lady in the cobweb dress she smiled at him

hello bod she said

hello he said as he danced with her i don’t know your name

names aren’t really important she said

i love your horse he’s so big i never knew horses could be that big

he is gentle enough to bear the mightiest of you away on his broad back and strong enough for the smallest of you as well

can i ride him asked bod

one day she told him and her cobweb skirts shimmered one day everybody does

either this wallpaper goes or i do

youre dead george you just dont have the sense to lie down

i think that with age people come to realize that death is inevitable and we need to learn to face it with serenity wisdom and resignation death often frees us from a lot of senseless sufferings

death i had discovered long ago was available in varying flavors and none of them particularly palatable

i wish i had a memory of that first violent shove the shock of cold air the sting of oxygen into new lungs everyone should remember being born it doesnt seem fair that we only remember dying

if you treat every situation as a life and death matter youll die a lot of times

one could argue that its romantic to die for love of course then youre dead and unable to take that honeymoon trip to the alps with all the other fashionable young couples which is a shame

do you wrestle with dreams

do you contend with shadows

do you move in a kind of sleep

time has slipped away

your life is stolen

you tarried with trifles

victim of your folly

oh we do not understand death we never understand it creatures are only truly dead when everyone else has died who knew them

nothing in his life became him like the leaving it

clown good madonna why mournest thou

olivia good fool for my brothers death

clowni think his soul is in hell madonna

oliviai know his soul is in heaven fool

clown the more fool madonna to mourn for your brothers soul being in heaven

but thy strong hours indignant work’d their wills

and beat me down and marr’d and wasted me

and tho’ they could not end me left me maim’d

to dwell in presence of immortal youth

and all i was in ashes

the evil that men do lives after them

the good is oft interred with their bones

not only had my brother disappeared butand bear with me herea part of my very being had gone with him stories about us could from them on be told from only one perspective memories could be told but not shared

everyone dies it is how one lives that matters

when it comes to death we know that laughter and tears are pretty much the same thing

the weather of love

has a way of wilting

or blossoming

at the strangest

most unpredictable hour

this is how love is

an uncontrollable beast

in the form of a flower

the sun does not always shine on it

nor does the rain always pour on it

nor should it always get beaten by a storm

love does not always emit the sweetest scents

and sometimes it can sting with its thorns

water it

give it plenty of sunlight

nurture it

and the flower of love will

outlive you

neglect it or keep dissecting it

and its petals will quickly curl up and die

this is how love is

perfection is a delusional vision

so love the person who loves you

and abandon the one

who only loves you

through rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows

the west wind goes walking and about the walls it goes

what news from the west oh wandering wind do you bring to me tonight

have you seen boromir the tall by moon or by starlight

‘i saw him ride over seven streams over waters wide and grey

i saw him walk in empty lands until he passed away

into the shadows of the north i saw him then no more

the north wind may have heard the horn of the son of denethor’

oh boromir from the high walls westward i looked afar

but you came not from the empty lands where no men are

from the mouth of the sea the south wind flies

from the sand hills and the stones

the wailing of the gulls it bears and at the gate it moans

what news from the south oh sighing wind do you bring to me at eve

where now is boromir the fair he tarries and i grieve

‘ask me not where he doth dwellso many bones there lie

on the white shores and on the black shores under the stormy sky

so many have passed down anduin to find the flowing sea

ask of the north wind news of them the north wind sends to me’

oh boromir beyond the gate the seaward road runs south

but you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth

from the gate of kings the north wind rides

and past the roaring falls

and loud and cold about the tower its loud horn calls

what news from the north oh mighty wind do you bring to me today

what news of boromir the bold for he is long away

‘beneath amon hen i heard his cry there many foes he fought

his cloven shield his broken sword they to the water brought

his head so proud his face so fair his limbs they laid to rest

and rauros golden rauros falls bore him upon its breast’

oh boromir the tower of guard shall ever northward gaze

to rauros golden rauros falls until the end of days

nothing remains forever only thing that remain forever is romantically stupid word forever

were all ghosts we all carry inside us people who came before us

woe destruction ruin and decay the worst is death and death will have his day

dont fear the gods

dont worry about death

what is good is easy to get and

what is terrible is easy to endure

maybe before you die its your ghosts you see

the many men so beautiful

and they all dead did lie

and a thousand thousand slimy things

lived on and so did i

death is an inevitability isnt it you become more aware of that when you get to my age i dont worry about it im ready for it when i go i want to go doing what i do best if i died tomorrow i couldnt complain its been good

no my dog used to gaze at me

paying me the attention i need

the attention required

to make a vain person like me understand

that being a dog he was wasting time

but with those eyes so much purer than mine

he’d keep on gazing at me

with a look that reserved for me alone

all his sweet and shaggy life

and asking nothing

this is the secret that none dares tell who fights for a cause dying we are all alike

its not how you die its who you die

she already felt dead in everything but name what remained to be taken from her she longed to be enfolded welcomed into the earth  to breathe no more love no more hurt no more

i was caught in a love triangle with one dead side

only one thing mattered this was not a horcrux dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that horrible potion for nothing harry crumpled the parchment in his hand and his eyes burned with tears as behind him fang began to howl

the maxims of medicine

before you examine the body of a patient

be patient to learn his story

for once you learn his story

you will also come to know

his body

before you diagnose any sickness

make sure there is no sickness in the mind or heart

for the emotions in a man’s moon or sun

can point to the sickness in

any one of his other parts

before you treat a man with a condition

know that not all cures can heal all people

for the chemistry that works on one patient

may not work for the next

because even medicine has its own

before asserting a prognosis on any patient

always be objective and never subjective

for telling a man that he will win the treasure of life

but then later discovering that he will lose

will harm him more than by telling him

that he may lose

but then he wins

the maxims of medicine by suzy kassem

death and life are the same thinglike the two sides of my hand the palm and the back and still the palm and the back are not the samethey can be neither separated nor mixed

wherever you are afraid try to explore and you will find death hiding somewhere behind all fear is of death death is the only fear source

if there be light then there is darkness if cold heat if height depth if solid fluid if hard soft if rough smooth if calm tempest if prosperity adversity if life death

to study philosophy is nothing but to prepare one’s self to die

who but the mad would choose to keep on living in the end arent we all just a little crazy

you must know that i am made of death from head to foot and it is a corpse who loves you and adores you and will never never leave you

grimly she realized that clocks dont make a sound that even remotely resembles ticking tocking it was more the sound of a hammer upside down hacking methodically at the earth it was the sound of a grave

with one long breath caught and held in his chest he fought his sadness over his solitary life dont cry you idiot live or die but dont poison everything

grief is love turned into an eternal missing

neither of the two people in the room paid any attention to the way i came in although only one of them was dead

energy is neither created nor destroyed it just changes shape

and what does it mean  dying perhaps man has a hundred senses and only the five we know are lost at death while the other ninetyfive remain alive

maybe this is how you become a rittevon she thought you get used to the dead being described as numbers not fathers or daughters or grandparents

she turned to dove when ochobu finished don’t ever be like this she urged don’t think that it doesn’t matter if you only hear of murder as a number if you keep it at a distance

im assuming youve got some time you interrupting bastard

but i will say this when the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on i will tell the scientists to screw off because i do not want to see a world without him

and then having made my rhetorical point i will put my robot eyes on because i mean with robot eyes you can probably see through girls’ shirts and stuff augustus my friend godspeed

augustus nodded for a while his lips pursed and then gave isaac a thumbsup after hed recovered his composure he added i would cut the bit about seeing through girls shirts

isaac was still clinging to the lectern he started to cry he pressed his forehead down to the podium and i watched his shoulders shake and then finally he said goddamn it augustus editing your own eulogy

the family exists for many reasons but its most basic function may be to draw together after a member dies

death ends a life not a relationship

for the book thief everything was going nicely

for me the sky was the color of jews

wait said butler just wait holly artemis has a plan he squinted through the green dome what is your plan artemis

all artemis could do was smile and shrug

in the middle of life death comes

to take your measurements the visit

is forgotten and life goes on but the suit

is being sewn on the sly

we are frightfully concerned with our own deaths sometimes so much so that we forget the real purpose of our lives

thats the beautiful thing about innocence even monsters have a pocketful of childhood memories with which to seek comfort with

all of our laments could not add a single second to her life not one additional beat of the heart nor a breath

love is undyingof that i feel certaini mean deepabidingcherishing lovethe love that gives protection even as youmy guardian angelgave me protection long after you had goneand continue to give this very day

a love beyond deatha love that makes life alive

the first quality of an honest man is contempt for religion which would have us afraid of the most natural thing in the world which is death and would have us hate the one beautiful thing destiny has given us which is life

if anyone stops us as long as we mumble something pretentious about the glory of death we should be fine

every night death came slowly painfully and every morning maddox awoke in bed knowing hed have to die again later that was his greatest curse and his eternal punishment

you dont have friends in here youll soon come to understand that you get attached to someone then youll just lose them theyll get shanked or theyll jump or theyll be taken one night

death is more universal than life everyone dies but not everyone lives

life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it a jealous possessive love that grabs at what it can

an eye for an eye my friend

me im still waitin for hurricane ed old ed wouldnt hurt ya would he sounds kinda friendly hell no we aint evacuatin eds comin

everyone you have ever loved in your life becomes a part of your soul they never leave theyre always inside you and you can bring them out whenever you want

they say that somewhere in africa the elephants have a secret grave where they go to lie down unburden their wrinkled gray bodies and soar away light spirits at the end

i ggguessim dead she heard her own voice call out strangely highpitched and thin

for a long time she heard nothing else and then

hi dead im dan

soldiers live he dies and not you and you feel guilty because youre glad he died and not you soldiers live and wonder why

got it demon death doom

the dead have a way of becoming saints in the eyes of their survivors

i am only alive because i have not yet died

i said i need to know how he died

he flipped back and pointed at why

so i can stop inventing how he died im always inventing

oh julie wouldn’t i know if you were dead wouldn’t i feel it happening like a jolt of electricity to my heart

i melted into the dream as if i had always been there i knew where i had come from i knew where i was going

death mostly they arent too keen to see me they fear the sunless lands but they enter your realm each night without fear

morpheus and i am far more terrible than you sister

we should keep the dead before our eyes and honor them as though still living

it struck mort with sudden terrible poignancy that death must be the loneliest creature in the universe in the great party of creation he was always in the kitchen

how do you get all those coins asked mort

i tried to hang myself with a bungee cord i kept almost dying

either we live by accident and die by accident or we live by plan and die by plan

i cant die yet doctor not yet i have things to do afterwords ill have a whole lifetime in which to die

how would that be just how would that be

i imagine death so much it feels more like a memory

i have lived with you and loved you and now you are gone gone where i cannot follow until i have finished all of my days

he could not stand it was not

that he could not thrive he was born

with everything but the will –

that can be deformed just like a limb

death was more interesting to him

life could not get his attention

suicide sometimes proceeds from cowardice but not always for cowardice sometimes prevents it since as many live because they are afraid to die as die because they are afraid to live

they that love beyond the world cannot be separated by it

death cannot kill what never dies

nor can spirits ever be divided that love and live in the same divine principle the root and record of their friendship

if absence be not death neither is theirs

death is but crossing the world as friends do the seas they live in one another still

for they must needs be present that love and live in that which is omnipresent

in this divine glass they see face to face and their converse is free as well as pure

this is the comfort of friends that though they may be said to die yet their friendship and society are in the best sense ever present because immortal

if you gave jerry falwell an enema he could be buried in a matchbox

amy winehouse changed pop music forever i remember knowing there was hope and feeling not alone because of her she lived jazz she lived the blues

i forgive you i said i said what i had to i would die by pieces to save myself from real death

its really really true

a thought stabs up growing from my toes and ripping through me until it stifles everything else and becomes the only thing im thinking it fills me up like a silent scream

yes bastille i keep trying to get killed because its inconvenient for you

there i lay wearing dead people as armor against death

what i look forward to is continued immaturity followed by death

death is another bar which lies several steps below the normal world im at its threshold but not yet in it its doorway is doorless

its a little hard not to worry when my best friend keeps on dying

what i wanted to express very clearly and intensely was that the reason these people had to invent or imagine heroes and gods is pure fear fear of life and fear of death

life is about moving it’s about change and when things stop doing that they’re dead

matt i didnt think theyd kill you im so sorry

death isnt the end its the beginning

isnt life she stammered isnt life but what life was she couldnt explain no matter he quite understood

isnt it darling said laurie

here at last

we shall be free

the almighty hath not built

here for his envy will not drive us hence

here we may reign secure and in my choice

to reign is worth ambition though in hell

better to reign in hell than serve in heaven

youre goddamn right they didnt

he ought to know he was the nearest thing to a dead man on earth

well death says as he walks by im going to get you anyhow no matter what youve been writer cabdriver pimp butcher skydiver im going to get you

clearly god was in some kind of mood on my birthday

it was not my intention to collapse no i would die standing

death as the destruction of all things no longer had meaning when life was revealed to be a fatuous sequence of empty words the hollow jingle of a jester’s cap and bells

one of the grubby truths about a loss is that you dont just mourn the dead person you mourn the person you got to be when the lost one was alive this loss might even be what affects you most

when i die i said to my friend im not going to be embalmed im going to be dipped milk chocolate or bittersweet was the immediate concern

witness also that when we talk about literature we do so in the present tense when we speak of the dead we are not so kind

and then do you know monsieur marius i believe i was a little in love with you

she essayed to smile again and expired

she was a wolf she was death devourer of the worlds

give me a meaningful love or a beautiful death

all that is not god is death

imagine being sentient but not alive seeing and even knowing but not alive just looking out recognizing but not being alive a person can die and still go on sometimes what looks out at you from a persons eyes maybe died back in childhood

we are biology we are reminded of this at the beginning and the end at birth and at death in between we do what we can to forget

can you show me who places any value on his time who reckons the worth of each day who understands that he is

dying daily for we are mistaken when we look forward to death the major portion of death has already passed

whatever years be behind us are in deaths hands

i love the name of honor more than i fear death

the fear of death is why we build cathedrals have children declare war and watch cat videos online at three am

let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry

to his coy mistress

had we but world enough and time

this coyness lady were no crime

we would sit down and think which way

to walk and pass our long love’s day

thou by the indian ganges’ side

shouldst rubies find i by the tide

of humber would complain i would

love you ten years before the flood

and you should if you please refuse

till the conversion of the jews

my vegetable love should grow

vaster than empires and more slow

an hundred years should go to praise

thine eyes and on thy forehead gaze

two hundred to adore each breast

but thirty thousand to the rest

an age at least to every part

and the last age should show your heart

for lady you deserve this state

nor would i love at lower rate

but at my back i always hear

time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near

and yonder all before us lie

thy beauty shall no more be found

nor in thy marble vault shall sound

my echoing song then worms shall try

that longpreserved virginity

and your quaint honour turn to dust

and into ashes all my lust

the grave’s a fine and private place

but none i think do there embrace

now therefore while the youthful hue

and while thy willing soul transpires

at every pore with instant fires

now let us sport us while we may

and now like amorous birds of prey

rather at once our time devour

than languish in his slowchapped power

let us roll all our strength and all

our sweetness up into one ball

and tear our pleasures with rough strife

thorough the iron gates of life

thus though we cannot make our sun

stand still yet we will make him run

its a time of sorrow and sadness when we lose a loss of life

when they write my obituary tomorrow or the next day it will say leo gursky is survived by an apartment full of shit

on the death of his child

and all our world is dewso dear

so fresh so fleeting

not for me nor for any human being we can only go forward unless we are guests in some enchantment that is not is ours we are condemned to an endless present and we can never go backthe source of all our joy and all our sorrow

hem at zelikas grave

o weep for adonis  he is dead

peace he is not dead he doth not sleep  he hath wakened from the dream of life

i became a firefighter because i wanted to save people but i should have been more specific i should have named names

reproduction is more pleasurable than death

we are all the fools of time and terror days

steal on us and steal from us yet we live

loathing our life and dreading still to die

deafness doesnt prevent composers hearing the music it prevents them hearing the distractions

youre probably wondering whats going to happen to you thats easy the same thing is going to happen to you that has happened to every other human being who has ever lived youre going to die we all die thats just how it is

death is nothing at all

i have only slipped into the next room

i am i and you are you

whatever we were to each other that we are still

call me by my old familiar name

speak to me in the easy way which you always used

put no difference in your tone

wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow

laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes we enjoyed together

play smile think of me pray for me

let my name be ever the household world that it always was

let it be spoken without effect without the trace of shadow on it

life means all that it ever meant

it it the same as it ever was there is unbroken continuity

why should i be out of mind because i am out of sight

i am waiting for you for an interval somewhere very near

just around the corner

all is well

time is a great teacher but unfortunately it kills all its students

there is a certain right by which we many deprive a man of life but none by which we may deprive him of death this is mere cruelty

ive seen and swam and climbed and lived and driven and filmed should it all end tomorrow i can definitely say there would be no regrets i am very lucky and i know it i really have lived  times over

neither the sun nor death can be looked at steadily

he wipes tears off my face and then snot he uses his hands he loves me that much

nothing is permanent the only thing any of us have in common is the inevitable

we fall from womb to tomb from one blackness and toward another remembering little of the one and knowing nothing of the other  except through faith

now comes the mystery last words

bushido is realized in the presence of death this means choosing death whenever there is a choice between life and death there is no other reasoning

susannah continued if and when i go off slow dancing in the ever after i dont want to look like ive been stuck in a hospital room my whole life i at least want to be tan

i have nothing now but praise for my life im not unhappy i cry a lot because i miss people they die and i cant stop them they leave me and i love them more

pain can kill all on its own the body goes into shock and shuts down

your coffin reached the monstrous hole and a part of me went down into the muddy earth with you and lay down next to you and died with you

grief no matter how you try to cater to its wail has a way of fading away

only those few who are able to surpass their fear of death completely can fully experience the highest forms of life not the mundane life of the mortal but the godly life of the resurrected

nico found a sort of freedom in knowing that eventually no matter what happened he would end up at the foot of his father’s throne

but remember that good intentions pave many roads not all of them lead to hell

when darkness falls and eyes stay shut

a chain of voices opens up

let wax not wane give breath to death

ps shhh yvonne woondead beautiful

i’d never seen anything like it first a trial then a few murders then dancing life goes on or in this case death continues

ive never wished a man dead but i have read some obituaries with great pleasure

o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth  that i am meek and gentle with these butchers

zalos the world is full of massive things in motion little creatures get hurt

everything that happens before death is what counts

nevertheless life and death are mysterious states and we know little of the resources of either

mendacity is a system that we live in declares brick liquor is one way out andeaths the other

sunsets are loved because they vanish

flowers are loved because they go

the dogs of the field and the cats of the kitchen are loved because soon they must depart

these are not the sole reasons but at the heart of morning welcomes and afternoon laughters is the promise of farewell in the gray muzzle of an old dog we see goodbye in the tired face of an old friend we read long journeys beyond returns

we only live once we all have an expiration date after that we will never come again i am not saying that to make you sad i am saying that so you can cherish each moment in your life and be grateful that you are here and you are special

relax theyre not going to kill us theyre going to try and kill us and that is a very different thing

my life was going to flash before my eyes but it decided to hide behind my eyes and quake with terror instead

death like a host comes smiling to the door

smiling he greets us on that tranquil shore

where neither piping bird nor peeping dawn

disturbs the eternal sleep

but in the stillness far withdrawn

our dreamless rest for evermore we keep

time moves on for us for you it stands still you will be forever ageless as we grow old your smile will never wrinkle nor will that shine in your eyes fade

life is a bitter sweet journey my friend a bitter sweet journey

i knew that i had been partially right in the storeroom above the bar on christmas day

whoever i had become had to die

i became quietly seized with that nostalgia that overcomes you when you have reached the middle of your life and your father has recently died and it dawns on you that when he went he took some of you with him

and so the boy known as the third man shinji mimura was dead

papa was a man with silver eyes not dead ones

papa was an accordion

but his bellows were all empty

nothing went in and nothing came out

i think of death only with tranquility as an end i refuse to let death hamper life death must enter life only to define it

superman comics are a fable not of strength but of disintegration they appeal to the preadolescent sic mind not because they reiterate grandiose delusions but because they reiterate a very deep cry for help

supermans two personalities can be integrated only in one thing only in death only kryptonite cuts through the disguises of both wimp and hero and affects the man below the disguises

and what is kryptonite kryptonite is all that remains of his childhood home

he fears that to reveal his weakness and confusion is perhaps indirectly but certainly inevitably to receive death from the person who received that information

there is no death in remembrance remember me sarah remember me and a part of me will always be with you  martha carrier to her daughter sarah carrier

you can still be cool when you’re dead in fact it’s much easier because you aren’t getting old and fat and losing your hair

john lennon said life was what happened while you made other plans so was death

death is not the end

death can never be the end

death is the road

life is the traveller

the soul is the guide

our mind thinks of death

our heart thinks of life

our soul thinks of immortality

depend upon it sir when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully

that is what death is like it doesnt matter what uniforms the soldiers are wearing it doesnt matter how good the weapons are i thought if everyone could see what i saw we would never have war anymore

he would work through the night and sleep until lunch there wasnt really much else to do make something and die

the day you lose someone isnt the worst at least youve got something to do its all the days they stay dead

there was a lot they didn’t tell you about death she had discovered and one of the biggies was how long it took the ones you loved most to die in your heart

i went on spouting bullshit encouragements as guss parents arm in arm hugged each other and nodded at every word funerals i had decided are for the living

right well hed been sick for a while and his nurse said to him you seem to be feeling better this morning and isben looked at her and said on the contrary and then he died

for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams

of the beautiful annabel lee

and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes

of the beautiful annabel lee

and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side

of my darling my darling my life and my bride

in the sepulchre there by the sea

in her tomb by the sounding sea

justice will prevail

the only certainty is death

to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day every day was there to be lived or to mark one’s departure from this world

each child’s story is worthy of telling there shouldn’t be a sliding scale of death the weight of it is crushing

how does one become a butterfly she asked pensively

you must want to fly so much that you are willing to give up being a caterpillar

you mean to die asked yellow remembering the three who fell out of the sky

yes and no he answered

what looks like you will die but whats really you will still live

i still loved granny it flowed out of my chest with granny gone where would my love go

the bird is gone and in what meadow does it now sing

after all death is a symbol that there was life

her blood is settled and her joints are stiff

life and these lips have long been separated

death lies on her like an untimely frost

upon the sweetest flower of all the field

dude you dont want to be dead take it from me nopussy is bad but dead is like nopussy times ten

down down down into the darkness of the grave

gently they go the beautiful the tender the kind

quietly they go the intelligent the witty the brave

i know but i do not approve and i am not resigned

when along the pavement

i forget my bereavement

the gap in the great constellation

the place where a star used to be

thats the kind of death that frightens me the shadow of death slowly slowly eats away at the region of life and before you know it everythings dark and you cant see and the people around you think of you as more dead than alive

birth is okay and death is okay if we know that they are only concepts in our mind reality transcends both birth and death

in the end we all lose it remember that in the end we own nothing

oh god oh god we’re all gonna die doesn’t really fit the definition of banter now does it

in the midst of life we are in death

the light at the end of the tunnel is just the light of an oncoming train

when all my days are ending

and i have no song to sing

i think that i shall not be too old

to stare at everything

as i stared once at a nursery door

or a tall tree and a swing

wherein god’s ponderous mercy hangs

on all my sins and me

because he does not take away

the terror from the tree

and stones still shine along the road

that are and cannot be

men grow too old for love my love

but i shall not grow too old to see

changing my chamber’s dust to snow

till i doubt if it be mine

behold the crowning mercies melt

the first surprises stay

and in my dross is dropped a gift

for which i dare not pray

that a man grow used to grief and joy

but not to night and day

men grow too old for love my love

but i shall not grow too old to see

a cloud that is larger than the world

and a monster made of eyes

nor am i worthy to unloose

the latchet of my shoe

or shake the dust from off my feet

or the staff that bears me through

on ground that is too good to last

too solid to be true

men grow too old to woo my love

men grow too old to wed

but i shall not grow too old to see

incredible rafters when i wake

and i find that i am not dead

a thrill of thunder in my hair

though blackening clouds be plain

still i am stung and startled

by the first drop of the rain

romance and pride and passion pass

and these are what remain

strange crawling carpets of the grass

wide windows of the sky

so in this perilous grace of god

with all my sins go i

and things grow new though i grow old

though i grow old and die

death is not the worst thing rather when one who craves death cannot attain even that wish

remember me even if its only in a corner and secretly dont let me go

death is our constant companion and it is death that gives each persons life its true meaning

lay down

your tired  weary head my friend

we have wept too long

and you are only sleeping

we have come to this journeys end

its time for us to go

to meet our friends

who beckon us

to jump again

from across a distant sky

a c comes to carry us

where we shall all wait

for the final green light

in the light of

the pale moon rising

i see far on the horizon

into the world of night and darkness

feet and knees together

time has ceased

but cherished memories still linger

this is the way of life and all things

we shall meet again

you are only sleeping

oh the torment bred in the race

the grinding scream of death

and the stroke that hits the vein

the hemorrhage none can staunch the grief

the curse no man can bear

but there is a cure in the house and not outside it no

not from others but from them

their bloody strife we sing to you

dark gods beneath the earth

now hear you blissful powers underground

answer the call send help

bless the children give them triumph now

ive never been in love i will die without knowing what it feels like to need to see one persons face when you go to sleep at night to crave seeing it when you wake up i wish i knew

where is polonius

in heaven send hither to see if your messenger find him not there seek him i th other place yourself but if indeed you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby

if you go to your death rather than do everything you might to prevent what is happening you are merely committing suicide and trying to make yourself feel better about it that is the act of a coward it is beneath contempt

it would be merciful to kill it said tialys

how do you know said lyra it might still like being alive in spite of everything

if we killed it wed be taking it with us said will it wants to stay here ive killed enough living things even a filthy stagnant pool might be better than being dead

but if its in pain said tialys

if it could tell us wed know but since it cant im not going to kill it that would be considering our feelings rather than the toads

they moved on

everything is true he said everything anybody has ever thought

will you be all right

ill be all right he said and thought and im going to die both those are true too

when you tire of living change itself seems evil does it not for then any change at all disturbs the deathlike peace of the lifeweary

how many more times do we have to come to terms with death before we find safety he asked

only happy people have nightmares from overeating for those who live a nightmare reality sleep is a black hole lost in time like death

i began to feel that all the people id ever known who had died or left me had not in fact gone away but continued to live on inside me just as this mans wife lived on inside him

do you wanna play everyones dead so i got bored did you come to play with me

to look upon its grass grown yard where the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly one would think that there at least the dead might rest in peace

you were free you are free and you will be free

with time to think the full reality of what had happened hit thomas like a falling boulder ever since thomas had entered the maze newt had been there for him thomas hadn’t realized just how much of a friend he’d become until now his heart hurt

he pulled the envelope out of his pocket and ripped it open then took out the slip of paper the soft lights that ringed the mirror lit up the message in a warm glow it was two short sentences

kill me if you’ve ever been my friend kill me

and thomas had failed him

thomas tried to pull his hand away but newt was too strong i can’t newt i can’t

make amends repent for what you did the words tore out of him his whole body trembling then his voice dropped to an urgent harsh whisper kill me you shuck coward prove you can do the right thing put me out of my misery

the words horrified thomas newt maybe we can—

shut up just shut up i trusted you now do it

i can’t

do it

i can’t how could newt ask him to do something like this how could he possibly kill one of his best friends

kill me or i’ll kill you kill me do it

do it before i become one of them

kill me and then newt’s eyes cleared as if he’d gained one last trembling gasp of sanity and his voice softened please tommy please

with his heart falling into a black abyss thomas pulled the trigger

it’s odd isn’t it people die every day and the world goes on like nothing happened but when it’s a person you love you think everyone should stop and take notice that they ought to cry and light candles and tell you that you’re not alone

it was like having frostbite all over  feeling numb and in pain at the same time

and anyway it’s not as though i’ll never see mum again is it

from too much love of living

from hope and fear set free

we thank with brief thanksgiving

whatever gods may be

that no life lives for ever

that dead men rise up never

that even the weariest river

winds somewhere safe to sea

then star nor sun shall waken

nor any change of light

nor sound of waters shaken

nor any sound or sight

nor wintry leaves nor vernal

nor days nor things diurnal

only the sleep eternal

in an eternal night

your father is dead

from his old coats

ill make you little jackets

ill make you little trousers

from his old pants

therell be in his pockets

things he used to put there

keys and pennies

covered with tobacco

dan shall have the pennies

to save in his bank

anne shall have the keys

to make a pretty noise with

anne eat your breakfast

i forget just why

hes waiting for yu young queen

the warriors look was wise and understanding  his voice gentle aye yur heath probably does await you somewhere in the future but it is of your guardian i speak

your least favorite virtue or nominee for the most overrated one faith closely followed—in view of the overall shortage of time—by patience

and death doesnt wait for you when your rested and ready it sneaks up on you when your exhausted and hungry and cold and so scared you cant even see straight

death doesnt really worry me that much im not frightened about it i just dont want to be there when it happens

when the suicide arrived at the sky the people there asked him why he replied because no one admired me

a life is not a waste of time

death isnt peaceful it is just nothing everything is gone no more sunrises no more hopes no more fears nothing

my love do you recall the object which we saw

that fair sweet summer morn

at a turn in the path a foul carcass

its legs raised in the air like a lustful woman

burning and dripping with poisons

its belly swollen with gases

one of the gravestones in the cemetery near the earliest church has an anchor on it and an hourglass and the words in hope

in hope why did they put that above a dead person was it the corpse hoping or those still alive

here lies a gentleman bold

who was so very brave

he went to lengths untold

and on the brink of the grave

death had on him no hold

by the world he set small store

he frightened it to the core

yet somehow by fates plan

though hed lived a crazy man

when he died he was sane once more

if under fell if over leaped

if death was life and death life reaped

something rises from the gloom

to make the underland a tomb

hear it scratching down below

will the warrior drain your light

what could turn the warrior week

what do burning gnawers seek

just a barely speaking pup

that holds the land of under up

die the baby die his heart

die his most essential part

die the peace that rules the hour

gnawers have their key to power

he was dead all right he had been shot poisoned stabbed and strangled

either somebody had really had it in for him or four people had killed him or else it was the cleverest suicide id ever heard of

id rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you

why should a man desire in any way

to vary from the kindly race of men

or pass beyond the goal of ordinance

where all should pause as is most meet for all

why wilt thou ever scare me with thy tears

and make me tremble lest a saying learnt

in days faroff on that dark earth be true

‘the gods themselves cannot recall their gifts’

can’t clean up after you anymore baby brother so don’t punk out make it count

what makes patriotic and religious fanatics such dangerous opponents is not the deaths of the fanatics themselves but their willingness to accept the deaths of a fraction of their number in order to annihilate or crush their infidel enemy

darkling i listen and for many a time

i have been half in love with easeful death

they say that just before you die your whole life flashes before your eyes but thats not how it happened for me

and after a whilei mean how do you choose who gets to live part of life is thatwell some people have to die my powers arent a prescription you can get filled as needed

when you realize that eternity is right here now that it is within your possibility to experience the eternity of your own truth and being then you grasp the following that which you are was never born and will never die

we have once again succeeded in destroying what we could not create

the monster nevers dies

doesnt our knowledge of death make life more precious

what good is a preciousness based on fear and anxiety its an anxious quivering thing

for he who lives more lives than one more deaths than one must die

because each of you has his or her own death you carry it with you in a secret place from the moment youre born it belongs to you and you belong to it

if you want to call it that but it is a very specific sort of magic theres a magic you take from death something leaves the world something else comes into it

just as when we come into the world when we die we are afraid of the unknown but the fear is something from within us that has nothing to do with reality dying is like being born just a change

circe he says it will be all right

for while directly we say that it the length of human life is ages long we are reminded that it is briefer than the fall of a rose leaf to the ground

for death is life it is only living that is lifeless

where music thundered let the mind be still

where the will triumphed let there be no will

what light revealed now let the dark fulfill

for the first time on the road north of tampico

i felt the life sliding out of me

a drum in the desert harder and harder to hear

i was seven i lay in the car

past the glass

my stomach was a melon split wide inside my skin

how do you know if you are going to die

i begged my mother

we had been traveling for days

with strange confidence she answered

when you can no longer make a fist

years later i smile to think of that journey

the borders we must cross separately

stamped with our unanswerable woes

i who did not die who am still living

still lying in the backseat behind all my questions

clenching and opening one small hand

when his brain died all of the memories

held in his gray matter along with all of the knowledge he had acquired would simply evaporate

it is good that a mans enemies want him dead for it proves he has lived a life of worth

im a man who believes that i died  years ago and i live like a man who is dead already i have no fear whatsoever of anybody or anything

a breeze blows up touching my cheek like a little childs kiss it flutters a piece of paper trash out there must belong to one of us we move closer and when i reached for it i find a perfect paper airplane

everyones immortal until theyre not

no death no doom no anguish can arouse the surpassing despair which flows from a loss of identity

through the gates of the silver key

god there must be a meaning fiercely he was certain that there must be a meaning

surely while we live we are not lost

oh janos janos my brother

surely we are not lostwhile we live

opal is dead and i dont see how a healer can change that its not something to joke about

joke then owen hit his forehead and cried thats right you havent heard

heard what asked adrien who felt an insane glimmer of hope return to his heart

death is on strike she hasnt done that for two centuries and its very annoying your friend is alive

very annoying repeated amber i dont see whats so annoying about a miracle what is death on strike for

everyone knows that death lives in fairytalein an inaccessible area obviously and just a few hours ago she decided to stop working so for now no one can die

can you do it when the time comes when the time comes there will be no time now is the time curse god and die what if it doesnt fire it has to fire could you crush that beloved skull with a rock

tell me not in mournful numbers

life is but an empty dream

for the soul is dead that slumbers

and things are not what they seem

she was their ammu and their baba and she had loved them double

i dont care if the new york times writes an obituary for me i just want you to write one  you say youre not special because the world doesnt know about you but thats an insult to me i know about you

the rest is silence

that is death  shifting from is to was

but somebody else had spoken snape’s name quite softly

the sound frightened harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening for the first time dumbledore was pleading

snape gazed for a moment at dumbledore and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face

snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at dumbledore

more people can see the face of death while their sleep in their own bed rather than people who can see the face of death while their flying in the plane

but why more people scare to take a plane than people who take a bed

you cant just make me different and then leave

maybe you should say goodbye cal

no

it might be important

it might make her die

my wallpaper and i are fighting a duel to the death one or the other of us has to go

one wants to tell a story like scheherezade in order not to die its one of the oldest urges in mankind its a way of stalling death

if you love someone youre not supposed to want them to come back better a peaceful sleep in the earth than the life of a zombienot really dead but not really alive either

take what comes and live life without complaint what will be will be life is a womans gift death is gods

the truth is that i feel totally helpless or totally inconsolable to be more honest i’m not trying to hide it but it’s something you’re not to worry about

nothing they say is more certain than death and nothing more uncertain than the time of dying

children just cannot be sad too long it is not in them as children mourn in little bits here and there like patchwork in their lives

im not ashamed of heroic ambitions if man and woman can only dance upon this earth for a few countable turns of the sun let each of us be an artemis odysseus or zeus aphrodite to the extent of the will of each one

on his gravestone i told you i was ill

i wonder if it hurts to live

and if they have to try

and whether could they choose between

they would not rather die

now what is history it is the centuries of systematic explorations of the riddle of death with a view to overcoming death that’s why people discover mathematical infinity and electromagnetic waves that’s why they write symphonies

death is the graduation of the soul

only god knows how much i loved you

the thing about butterflies mr crow is that they need to be admired from afar

does it make you brave to stick your hand in a bears mouth would you do it again just because you didnt die

then thalia grace became their leader and started recruiting even more young women to their cause which grated on nico – as if bianca’s death could be forgotten as if she could be replaced

darkling i listen and for many a time

i have been half in love with easeful death

calld him soft names in many a musèd rhyme

to take into the air my quiet breath

you have reached the end of cake

i have a serious question

i will give a serious answer

can a god be killed

the humor drained from romans face well that depends on if youre a pantheist or a marxist

whats the difference

i loved my mother too i said i still do thats the thing  it never goes away even if the person does

but youre dead said harry

then am i dead too

ah said dumbledore smiling still more broadly that is the question isnt it on the whole dear boy i think not

the dead know only one thing it is better to be alive

when she expressed a doubtful hope that tinker bell would be glad to see her he said ‘who is tinker bell’

‘o peter’ she said shocked but even when she explained he could not remember

‘there are such a lot of them’ he said ‘i expect she is no more’

i expect he was right for fairies don’t live long but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them

the final reward of the dead  to die no more

i am forever walking upon these shores

betwixt the sand and the foam

the high tide will erase my foot prints

and the wind will blow away the foam

but the sea and the shore will remain forever

damn it how will i ever get out of this labyrinth

life is a predicament which precedes death

fireheart dashed to the warriors side cloudtail was standing stifflegged every hair in his pelt on end as if he were facing an enemy his eyes were fixed on the limp heap of tabby fur huddled at his paws

why fireheart cloudtail wailed why her

fireheart knew but rage and grief made it hard to speak because tigerstar wants the pack to get a taste of cat blood he rasped

the dead cat lying in front of them was brindleface

but often life asks much of you and you either honor life by answering with all your heart or you cower your way into your grave

there is a certain seductiveness about dead things you can ill treat alter and recolour whats dead it won’t complain

many people will find this book disrespectful there is nothing amusing about being dead they will say ah but there is

death has this much to be said for it

you dont have to get out of bed for it

wherever you happen to be

they bring it to you—free

i love you anna covey he said his voice barely audible and slowly clumsily he leant forward and his lips found hers and anna felt him kiss her awkwardly she knew that she wasnt a surplus any more and nor was peter

i believe that more people would be alive today if there were a death penalty

no man should go to valhalla with brothel rash

im so scared of dying without ever being really seen can you understand

that we must all die we always knew i wish i had remembered it sooner

ill stop eating steak when you stop killing spiders absurdity comparing cows to spiders arachnids are pure evil theyre like a cigarette manufacturer or a terrorist theyre organized religion on eight legs

it cant be that life is so senseless and horrible but if it really has been so horrible and senseless why must i die and die in agony there is something wrong

here i amwanting to accomplish something and completely forgetting it must all endthat there is such a thing as death

once to swim i sought the seaside

there to sport among the billows

with the stone of many colors

sank poor aino to the bottom

of the deep and boundless bluesea

to the borders of these waters

never during all thy lifetime

as thou lovest daughter aino

mother dear i sought the seaside

there to sport among the billows

with the stone of many colors

sank poor aino to the bottom

of the deep and boundless bluesea

with the blueseas foam and waters

never during all thy lifetime

as thou lovest daughter aino

brother dear i sought the seaside

there to sport among the billows

with the stone of many colors

sank poor aino to the bottom

of the deep and boundless bluesea

never bring thy steeds to water

to the borders of the bluesea

never during all thy lifetime

as thou lovest sister aino

sister dear i sought the seaside

there to sport among the billows

with the stone of many colors

sank poor aino to the bottom

of the deep and boundless bluesea

never come to lave thine eyelids

in this rolling wave and seafoam

never during all thy lifetime

as thou lovest sister aino

all the waters in the bluesea

shall be blood of ainos body

all the fish that swim these waters

shall be ainos flesh forever

all the willows on the seaside

shall be ainos ribs hereafter

all the seagrass on the margin

will have grown from ainos tresses

one hand was behind his back and he held it out presenting a bouquet of white and smoky purple lilies

they’re straight from the underworld by the way they are everlasting they won’t die

ten years shes dead and i still find myself some mornings reaching for the phone to call her she could no more be gone than gravity or the moon

my life closed twice before its close

it yet remains to see

if immortality unveil

a third event to me

so huge so hopeless to conceive

as these that twice befell

parting is all we know of heaven

and all we need of hell

a choir of seedlings arching their necks out of rotted tree stumps sucking life out of death i am the forests conscience but remember the forest eats itself and lives forever

are we so made that we have to take death in small doses daily or we could not go on with the business of living

he gave her a bright fake smile so much of life was a putting off of unhappiness for another time nothing was ever lost by delay he had a dim idea that perhaps if one delayed long enough things were taken out of ones hands altogether by death

let us beware of saying that death is the opposite of life the living being is only a species of the dead and a very rare species

i drive a motorbike so there is the whiff of the grim reaper round every corner especially in london

i was tired of being me

we are all resigned to death its life we arent resigned to

birth and death were easy it was life that was hard

quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore

sorry to hear about your dad

he shrugged he was seventy and we always told him fast food would kill him

he was hit by a pizza express truck

ill follow you even to death—but i wont live with you any more

i see a bright

under the overhead light

that shades into

and then into darker

and i cant see beyond that

death alone gives meaning to life and you will never fully live until you know you must die and make your peace with that knowledge

we never actively remember death odenigbo said the reason we live as we do is because we do not remember that we will die we will all die

meine mutige kämpferin fight death with all you have

suicide is an attack on societyan attack on its omnipotence on its denial of death and on its own despair

today however we are having a hard time living because we are so bent on outwitting death

she was the most beautiful thing i had ever seen a tiny bloody angel in the snow and they were going to destroy her

the day of my birth my death began its walk it is walking toward me without hurrying

odd isn’t it you know when your birthday is but not your death day even though you pass the date year after year never suspecting that some day…

to pursue wisdom is to live in such a way that one is prepared to face death when it comes

i live in a basement apartment and like it what does that say about me

probably that i overanalyze things

i’d give in to the grief but make sure i wasn’t loud enough to draw attention from those who think words will make me feel better

what is a mans life but a prelude to his death and what is death but a long sleep a most welcome forgetfulness

the wages of sin are death but by the time taxes are taken out its just sort of a tired feeling

selfdestruction would be a brief almost autoerotic freefall into a great velvet darkness

i used to love you

i still do

so selfish

i love the old you

the you that didnt shoot drugs

the you that didnt get beat on by men

you laugh in my face and call me a fool

but its true

i still love you

sometimesi can see the old you

when your eyes flash

when you almost look alive

then there’s the kind of zombie i’ve become now the one who has lost everything—his brain his heart his light his direction he wanders the world bumping into this tripping over that but keeps going and going that is life after death

my father died suddenly but also across the years he was still dying really  which meant i guess that he was still living too

fireheart tensed waiting for whatever had hunted down these apprentices to emerge from the trees and attack but nothing stirred feeling as if his legs hardly belonged to him he sprang down and stumbled across to swiftpaw

tonight i saw myself in the dark window as

the image of my father whose life

was spent like this

thinking of death to the exclusion

of other sensual matters

so in the end that life

was easy to give up since

it contained nothing even

my mothers voice couldnt make him

change or turn back

as he believed

that once you cant love another human being

you have no place in the world

yea noise then ill be brief oh happy dagger this is thy sheath there rust and let me die

i find relief from the questions only when i concede that i am not obliged to know everything i remind myself it is sufficient to know what i know and that what i know may not always be true

you can’t live your life thinking death is going to come all the time you have to live life and if it comes then we can only hope we were able to do all the things we wanted he has to want to do something everyone does

now i am about to take my last voyage a great leap in the dark

please dont die

perhaps its better if i live in your heart where the world cant see me if im dead there will be no stain on our love

thinking of deathstrange beautiful terrible and a long way offmade me feel happier than ever

and realized that death was not only a permanent probability as he had always believed but an immediate reality

i was discovering that the most precious gift someone can give us is time because what gives time its value is death

its not easy losing someone she said it never goes away does it the phantom pain they call it i said like amputees get when they can still feel their missing limbs

um hazel faltered you mean you wont youre not going to

claim your life thantos asked well lets see

he pulled a pureblack ipad from thin air death tapped the screen a few times and all frank could think was please dont let there be an app for reaping souls

no hazel yelped thats okay

are you sure death asked helpfully i have videoconferencing enabled i have his skype address here somewhere

and then his noise falls completely silent

and he stops struggling

and looking right into my eyes

he dies

my todd dies

death is just the last scene of the last act

cause if you shoot a bullet someone dies if you drop a bomb many die you hit a woman love dies but if you say the fword nothing actually happens

the dead look so terribly dead when theyre dead

i see black light his last words

still they have one thing i envy humans if nothing else have the good sense to die

when she fucked up all those years ago just a little girl terrified into paralysis she fell onto the enigma of herself

let me tell you something about dying its not as bad as they says

its the comingbacktolife part that hurts

surplus meant unnecessary not required

you couldn’t be a surplus if you were needed by someone else you couldn’t be a surplus if you were loved

so he asked hows death

hard she said it just keeps going

embrace the probability of your imminent deathand know there is nothing i can do to save you

death is the most sophisticated form of beauty and the most difficult to accept

death is harder on those who are left behind

maybe they did what they had to do to live and tried to get a little love and have a little fun before the darkness took them

i dont eat friggin lobster or anything like that because theyre alive when you kill it

girls are always saying things like i’m so unhappy that i’m going to overdose on aspirin but they’d be awfully surprised if they succeeded they have no intention of dying at the first sight of blood they panic

i think its cool to wear roadkill if i died and somebody wanted to wear my teeth around their neck to vmas id feel honored

warmblood now a bloodborne death

will rob your body of its breath

mark your skin and seal your fate

the underland becomes a plate

from looking at your neighbor and realizing his true significance and that he will die pity and compassion will arise in you for him and finally you will love him

that is a dream also only he has remained asleep while you have awakened and who knows which of you is the most fortunate

i was such a messed up person and he was still holding on

he made me feel unhinged    like he could take me apart and put me back together again and again

what are the dead anyway but waves and energy light shining from a dead star

which reminds me by the way of a dream i had a couple of weeks ago

i drew nearer in the case was a machine revolving slowly on a turntable a machine with metal parts that slid in and out and collapsed in upon themselves to form new images an inca temple… click click click… the pyramids… the parthenon

history passing beneath my very eyes changing every moment

i thought id find you here said a voice at my elbow

it was henry his gaze was steady and impassive in the dim light above his ear beneath the wire stem of his spectacles i could just make out the powder burn and the dark hole in his right temple

i was glad to see him though not exactly surprised you know i said to him everybody is saying that youre dead

he stared down at the machine the colosseum… click click click… the pantheon im not dead he said im only having a bit of trouble with my passport

what

he cleared his throat my movements are restricted he said

i no longer have the ability to travel as freely as i would like

hagia sophia st marks in venice what is this place i asked him

that information is classified im afraid

looked around curiously it seemed that i was the only visitor

is it open to the public i said

not generally no

i looked at him there was so much i wanted to ask him so much i wanted to say but somehow i knew there wasnt time and even if there was that it was all somehow beside the point

are you happy here i said at last

he considered this for a moment not particularly he said

but youre not very happy where you are either

st basils in moscow chartres salisbury and amiens he glanced at his watch

i hope youll excuse me he said but im late for an appointment

he turned from me and walked away i watched his back receding down the long gleaming hall

he is sorry

for every failure and every wrong

for letting his pa down

and hes looking up at me

and hes begging me

hes begging me

like im the only one who can forgive him

like its only me whos got the power

and all i can say is davy

and the fright and the terror in his noise is too much

its too much

and then it stops

davy slumps eyes still open eyes still staring back at me eyes still asking i swear for me to forgive him

and he lies there still

did she say anything before she died he asked

yes the surgeon said she said forgive him

forgive him my father asked

i think she was referring to the drunk driver who killed her

my grandmothers last act on earth was a call for forgiveness love and tolerance

she wanted us to forgive gerald the dumbass spokane indian alcoholic who ran her over and killed her

i think my dad wanted to go find gerald and beat him to death

i think my mother would have helped him

i think i would have helped him too

but my grandmother wanted us to forgive her murderer

even dead she was a better person than us

she had no time for sleep with the weight of the world upon her shoulders and she feared to dream sleep is a little death dreams the whisperings of the other who would drag us all into his eternal night

i love you he said his voice catching when i thought you were going to die i wanted to die

war is not just the business of death it is the antitheses of life

their going hence even as their coming hither

ripeness is all

when a solipsist dies  everything goes with him

the real hell of this he told her is that youre going to get through it

what happens when you return

and find nothing

but a hollowed shell

shingles and floor

walls and echoes

and the light that lead you here

has now burned out

and the ones who built it

and you cant go to them

no matter what shoes you wear

were all dead the moment were born just some of us get there faster than others

i will guard you from death for i have no fear of him

but all that is warm will go cold my ears will fall off and my eyes will melt my mouth will be clamped shut my lips will turn to glue

no taste or smell or touch or soundnothing to look at total emptiness for ever

pride and power fall when the person falls but discoveries of truth form legacies that can be built upon for generations

now hollow fires burn out to black

and lights are fluttering low

square your shoulders lift your pack

and leave your friends and go

o never fear lads naught’s to dread

look not left nor right

in all the endless road you tread

there’s nothing but the night

something inside a man goes to pieces when he has to bury the only person who ever understood him there is no time to heal that sort of wound

but thoughts the slave of life and life time’s fool

and time that takes survey of all the world

must have a stop

he loved me and i loved him but the number in my head was telling me that he was going to die today and the numbers had never been wrong

this feather stirs she lives if it be so it is a chance which does redeem all sorrows that ever i have felt

were all drowning but dont say it out loud

waking up was a daily cruelty an affront and she avoided it by not sleeping

the past attracts me the present frightens me because the future is death

ive changed my ways a little i cannot now

run with you in the evenings along the shore

except in a kind of dream and you if you dream a moment

you see me there

when he said to give him the sword i don’t think he meant for you to stick it in his guts

fuck you i hope you die

everybody dies i said so fuck you

death strange that there should be such a word and such a thing and we ever forget it that one should be living warm and beautiful full of hopes desires and wants one day and the next be gone utterly gone and forever

there are souls he thought whose umbilicus has never been cut they never got weaned from the universe they do not understand death as an enemy they look forward to rotting and turning into humus

his absence is so big its like hes there

never send to know for whom the bells tolls it tolls for thee

i wonder if everyone who faces death hurts like this its as though for the first time i realize how much just being alive makes my body ache but i dont want that ache to stop

unless their use by readers bring them to life books are indeed dead things

we rehearse for the big death through the little death of orgasm through erotic living death as transfiguration

death is not the end

always too eager for the future we

pick up bad habits of expectancy

till then we say

watching from a bluff the tiny clear

how slow they are and how much time they waste

refusing to make haste

yet still they leave us holding wretched stalks

of disappointment for though nothing balks

each big approach leaning with brasswork prinked

each rope distinct

flagged and the figurehead with golden tits

arching our way it never anchors its

no sooner present than it turns to past

right to the last

we think each one will heave to and unload

all good into our lives all we are owed

for waiting so devoutly and so long

but we are wrong

only one ship is seeking us a black

a huge and birdless silence in her wake

no waters breed or break

selling eternal life is an unbeatable business with no customers ever asking for their money back after the goods are not delivered

here are the things girls die of hunger disease accidents childbirth and violence it takes more than heartache to kill a girl girls are tough as rocks

there is just as much beauty in birth as there is in death and it changes our lives just the same they both add things to us and take things away pg  undone

after sixtyone years together she simply clutched my hand and exhaled

but what if all the tranquility all the comfort all the contentment were now to come to a horrifying end

look at the stupid poor people look at the stupid poor burnedout people look at the stupid poor burnedout people look at their dead baby its death porn for the masses

im not afraid to die what im afraid of is having reality get the better of me of having reality leave me behind

when i think of simone now i think of butterfly wings beautiful and excruciatingly delicate touch them once and they might disintegrate

shine in any season of your life

head on with confidence in your life’s pilgrim

in deep faith countless hope and unconditional love blessed by the almighty

newness of each rising day bringing forth colourful sunsets

enkindle your soul once more with courage joy and love

with a heart who once knew that hurt pain loss…

means to shine

the body tries to stop the mind from killing itself no matter the cost it is only the lack of strength the fatigue that lets the jumpers fall at last

death comes for us all brother you cannot hide from it forever we will die one day you and i

and that doesnt frighten you

rhy shrugged not nearly as much as the idea of wasting a perfectly good life in fear of it

under the wide and starry sky

dig the grave and let me lie

glad did i live and gladly die

and i laid me down with a will

this be the verse you grave for me

here he lies where he longd to be

home is the sailor home from the sea

and the hunter home from the hill

i mentally bless and exonerate anyone who has kicked a chair out from beneath her or swallowed opium in large chunks my mind has met their environment here in the void i understand perfectly

and the thing about trying to cheat death is that in the end you still lose

i feel the terror of idleness

death isnt just an idea

it felt as though the whole globe was dressed in snow like it has pulled it on the way you pull on a sweater next to the train line footprints were sunken to their shins trees wore blankets of ice

as you may expect someone has died

and starward drifts the stricken world

dead with a universe for tomb

dark and to vaster darkness whirled

the testimony of the suns

everybody has an angel hiding inside when you die your angel comes out you can die but not your angel your angel never dies

its a sword said the hogfather theyre not meant to be safe

we cry coming into the world as everyone around us laughs with joy and we laugh with joy leaving this world when everyone around us cries

life is too fleet for onomatopoeia

i want that i want that awful intense and serious unhappiness cos then i might feel better and then i might be happy

every blade in the field  every leaf in the forest  lays down its life in its season as beautifully as it was taken up

the bustle in a house

the morning after death

the sweeping up the heart

and putting love away

we shall not want to use again

until eternity

knockkneed coughing like hags we cursed through sludge

till on the haunting flares we turned our backs

and towards our distant rest began to trudge

but limped on bloodshod all went lame all blind

drunk with fatigue deaf even to the hoots

of disappointed shells that dropped behind

gas gas quick boys an ecstasy of fumbling

fitting the clumsy helmets just in time

but someone still was yelling out and stumbling

and floundering like a man in fire or lime

dim through the misty panes and thick green light

as under a green sea i saw him drowning

in all my dreams before my helpless sight

he plunges at me guttering choking drowning

if in some smothering dreams you too could pace

behind the wagon that we flung him in

and watch the white eyes writhing in his face

his hanging face like a devils sick of sin

if you could hear at every jolt the blood

come gargling from the frothcorrupted lungs

obscene as cancer bitter as the cud

my friend you would not tell with such high zest

to children ardent for some desperate glory

the one close to me now

even my own body

these too

will soon become clouds

wait stefan’s voice was hard suddenly bonnie and elena turned back and froze embracing each other trembling what is your—your father—going to do to you when he finds out that you allowed this

he will not kill me sage said brusquely the wild tone back in his voice he may even find it as amusant as i do and we will be sharing a belly laugh tomorrow

fear of death is form of stasis horrors the dead weight of time

the world is too brutal for me—i am glad there is such a thing as the grave—i am sure i shall never have any rest till i get there

most of the time i do not want to die but i would like to have the means of death within my grasp i want to feel the luxury of choice to know the answer to how do i bear this need not always be endure

but my point you see is that death is misunderstood the loss of ones life is not the greatest loss it is no loss at all to others perhaps but not to oneself

and having once chosen never to seek to return to the crossroads of that decisionfor even if one chooses wrongly the choice cannot be unmade

there was not an inch of solid ground anywhere in the world for me to call my own i didnt belong anywhere had i disappeared no one would have noticed

do not wait until the near end of your life to realize that you have not fully lived to love

no man kills himself unless there is something wrong with his life

how do you measure the life of one person against the greater good can it ever be the right thing to sacrifice an innocent person and how do you know what the greater good really is

here is one of the worst things about having someone you love die it happens again every single morning

the only reason people die is because everyone does it you all just go along with it

its rubbish death its stupid i dont want nothing to do with it

committing suicide so as not to be murdered is the worst reason ive ever heard of to die

i didn’t want any flowers i only wanted

to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty

how free it is you have no idea how free——

the peacefulness is so big it dazes you

and it asks nothing a name tag a few trinkets

it is what the dead close on finally i imagine them

shutting their mouths on it like a communion tablet

i basked in you

i loved you helplessly with a boundless tonguetied love

and death doesnt prevent me from loving you

in my opinion you arent dead

i know dead people and you are not dead

we walk into the rest of our lives together not knowing itll end before its truly started

the bombs were comingand so was i

yes they are carnal both of them love and death and therein lies their terror and their great magic

if while alive you hurt or disappoint people you love theres no use continuing such behavior when youre dead

i am old and i have had

more than my share of good and bad

ive had love and sorrow seen sudden death

and been left alone and of love bereft

i thought i would never love again

and i thought my life was grief and pain

the edge between life and death was thin

but then i discovered discipline

i learned to smile when i felt sad

i learned to take the good and the bad

i learned to care a great deal more

for the world about me than before

i began to forget the me and i

and joined in life as it rolled by

this may not mean sheer ecstasy

but is better by far than i and me

sin death and hell have set their marks on him

and all their ministers attend on him

i would rather live than die i would rather die than survive as a monster

the only way out is to die

death is as unexpected in his caprice as a courtesan in her disdain but death is truer – death has never forsaken any man

old age is not as honorable as death but most people seek it

and the dreams so rich in color how else would death call you waking in the cold dawn it all turned to ash instantly like certain ancient frescoes entombed for centuries suddenly exposed to the day

like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore

so do our minutes hasten to their end

each changing place with that which goes before

in sequent toil all forwards do contend

i got out on the street and started crying the kind of hysterical tears made justifiable only by turning off one’s cell phone putting it to the ear and pretending to be told of a death in the family

i want to look at you as you kill me

every morning is my birthday and every night is my deathday

hamlet  we fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for maggots your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes but to one table thats the end

hamlet a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm

claudius what dost thou mean by this

hamlet nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar

our immortality comes through our children and their children through our roots and branches the family is immortality and hitler has destroyed not just branches and roots but entire family trees forests all of them gone

we die just as we were born at the edge of a road not of our choosing

i am not a coward but i am so strong so hard to die

she made the decision that her existence had lost its meaning and you cannot judge that

and when your sorrow is comforted time soothes all sorrows you will be content that you have known me

do not mourn the dead they know what they are doing

when you reach the stars boy yes and live there forever all the fears will go and death himself will die

i want you here i dont care if its a hundred degrees and every blade of grass dies without you none of that matters to me

colder by the hour more dead with every breath

how do you tell if somethings alive you check for breathing

civilized society is perpetually menaced with disintegration through this primary hostility of men towards one another

he was death and hed ridden in on a pale horse

how easy to be a bird or an animal living from day to day unaware youre alive unaware that one day you will die

there was no hope in death only an end

they say that in the second before our death each of us understands the real reason for our existence and out of that moment heaven or hell is born

you try spending six months sitting at somebodys bedside waiting for them to die and then tell me that the happyending love story isnt one of gods good gifts

he had loved heroin more than it loved him i was shocked beyond imagining he was the first of my friends to fall

the worst that can possibly have happened to him is death and that we are all in forif not this morning then in days or weeks or years at most

its easier to die than to move  at least for the other side you dont need trunks

never underestimate the will of a creature who begins to die at birth

try to remember some details for the world

is filled with people who were torn from their sleep

with no one to mend the tear

and unlike wild beasts they live

each in his lonely hiding place and they die

and in hospitals

and the earth will swallow all of them

good and evil together like the followers of korah

all of them in their rebellion against death

their mouths open till the last moment

praising and cursing in a single

to remember some details

its normal to shy away from illness and death its natural to gravitate toward laughter and life

there was a roaring in my ears and i lost track of what they were saying i believe it was the physical manifestation of unbearable grief

death comes to me again a girl

it’s not so terrible she tells me

not like you think all darkness

and silence there are windchimes

and the smell of lemons some days

it rains but more often the air is dry

and sweet i sit beneath the staircase

built from hair and bone and listen

to the voices of the living i like it

she says shaking the dust from her hair

especially when they fight and when they sing

when my trust was suspended from the fragile thread of justice

and in the whole city

they were chopping up my hearts lanterns

when they would blindfold me

with the dark handkerchief of law

and from my anxious temples of desire

fountains of blood would squirt out

when my life had become nothing

but the tictac of a clock

i cant do anything to death doctors orders

think in a minute from now you could be saying i risked death i threw for life and i won life it is a very wonderful feeling to have survived

death is the true inspiring genius or the muse of philosophy wherefore socrates has defined the latter as θανάτου μελέτη indeed without death men would scarcely philosophise

give me liberty or give me death

from a speech given at saint johns church in richmond virginia on march   to the virginia house of burgesses as first published in print in  in william wirts life and character of patrick henry

if men only felt about death as they do about sleep all terrors would cease   men sleep contentedly assured that they will wake the following morning they should feel the same about their lives

the night sky is only a sort of carbon paper

blueblack with the muchpoked periods of stars

letting in the light peephole after peephole

a bonewhite light like death behind all things

only i want to do die as myself

no popularity exists when tragedy strikes all thats left are human hearts and love and ache we all love each other deep down and when we see another soul in pain we cant help but hurt too

not easy to state the change you made

if im alive now i was dead

though like a stone unbothered by it

if a man confessed anything on his death bed it was the truth for no man could stare death in the face and lie

a man begins dying at the moment of his birth most people live in denial of deaths patient courtship until late in life and deep in sickness they become aware of him sitting bedside

cyrano the leaves

roxane what colorperfect venetian red look at them fall

cyrano yesthey know how to die a little way

from the branch to the earth a little fear

of mingling with the common dustand yet

they go down gracefullya fall that seems

do you want to know something about tyrants when faced with death they weep and they beg just like the rest of us

once a flower is picked it immediately begins to die

destiny if i could sit across the porch from god id thank him for lending me you

copulation is no more foul to me than death is

but thats the thing with death the whisper of it descent travels fast and wide and people mustve know id become a corpse because nobody even came to view the body

why would a living person worry about what happens after they die ill just live freely for as long as possible

but hey if there’s one bright side to your dying it’s that you aren’t around to tell me things i don’t like hearing i’m sorry that was a dickhead thing to say i need a condom for my mouth

she dwelt among the untrodden ways

she dwelt among the untrodden ways

beside the springs of dove

a maid whom there were none to praise

and very few to love

a violet by a mossy stone

half hidden from the eye

—fair as a star when only one

is shining in the sky

she lived unknown and few could know

when lucy ceased to be

but she is in her grave and oh

the difference to me

a society that doesnt know any longer how to observe every death with proper rituals that does not know that death is not the end but only part of the journey has lost its way has had the very heart of its humanity torn out

when i am dying i should like my life taken out under general anaesthetic exactly as if it were a diseased appendix

why wont they let me be i just need to rest thats all to rest and sleep some and maybe die a little

its gonna hurt now said amy anything dead coming back to life hurts

every cataclysm is welcomed by somebody there is always someone to rejoice at disaster and see in it the prospect of a new beginning and a better world

and like that i said goodbye to my grandmother like we were two people who met in a coffee shop shared a lifetime of stories and left wanting more but knowing we’d meet there again

when the aggregates arise decay and die o bhikkhu every moment you are born decay and die

to what do i owe the pleasure of your company he said

i placed my hands flat on the table and leaned across it stay the hell away from him

he reached a hand out and placed it over my own i snatched my hand back he shook his head at me and whispered you cant stop it

you ask are you a man or a demon neither i say i have woken up and the rest of you are sleeping and that is the only difference between us

a child said what is the grass fetching it to me with full hands

how could i answer the child i do not know what it is any more

than he

i guess it must be the flag of my disposition out of hopeful green

or i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord

a scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt

bearing the owners name someway in the corners that we may see

and remark and say whose

or i guess the grass is itself a child the produced babe of the

or i guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic

and it means sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones

growing among black folks as among white

kanuck tuckahoe congressman cuff i give them the same i

receive them the same

and now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves

tenderly will i use you curling grass

it may be you transpire from the breasts of young men

it may be if i had known them i would have loved them

it may be you are from old people or from offspring taken soon out

of their mothers laps

and here you are the mothers laps

this grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers

darker than the colorless beards of old men

dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths

o i perceive after all so many uttering tongues

and i perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for

what do you think has become of the young and old men

and what do you think has become of the women and children

they are alive and well somewhere

the smallest sprout shows there is really no death

and if ever there was it led forward life and does not wait at the

end to arrest it

and ceasd the moment life appeard

all goes onward and outward nothing collapses

and to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier

i have almost completed a long novel but it is unpublishable until my death and englands

we each owe a death there are no exceptions i know that but sometimes oh god the green mile is so long

it bothered me that he was right without sir stuarts intervention id have been dead again already

thats rightyou heard me dead again already

i mean come on how screwed up is your life after or otherwise when you find yourself needing phrases like that

having made the decision to love had i chosen life instead of death

but there is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death

the sensation of trying to escape but never being able to im sure i felt that thats death

ill have that someday thought peter someone wholl kiss me goodbye at the door or maybe just someone to put a blindfold over my head before they shoot me depending on how things turn out

grandfather  death is nothing to be afraid of

renee  its not death im afraid of

grandfather what is it then

sometimes the dying live more fiercely and wisely than the rest of us

yes max you are going to die just like everybody else

thank you confucious

you fear them because you fear death and rightly for death is terrible and must be feared the mage saidand life is also a terrible thing ged said and must be feared and praised

that which has died falls not out of the universe if it stays here it also changes here and is dissolved into its proper parts which are elements of the universe and of thyself and these too change and they murmur not

she couldnt tell where his pupils ended and the irises began looking into those eyes was like looking into a well where children had drowned

all is as if the world did cease to exist the citys monuments go unseen its past unheard and its culture slowly fading in the dismal sea

for some folks death is release and for others death is an abomination a terrible thing but in the end im there for all of them

decline is also a form of voluptuousness just like growth autumn is just as sensual as springtime there is as much greatness in dying as in procreation

i must confess i have always wondered what lay beyond life my dear

yeah everybody wonders and sooner or later everybody gets to find out

it is always consoling to think of suicide

its what gets one through many a bad night

smiling at death seems like a pretty bold act and so i smile like a damned fool

survival is the celebration of choosing life over death we know were going to die we all die but survival is saying perhaps not today in that sense survivors dont defeat death they come to terms with it

but words are things and a small drop of ink

that which makes thousands perhaps millions think

’t is strange the shortest letter which man uses

of ages to what straits old time reduces

frail man when paper — even a rag like this

survives himself his tomb and all that’s his

i lost my father this past year and the word feels right because i keep looking for him as if he were misplaced as if he could just turn up like a sock or a set of keys

death is the reward for living

no mother should lose her child

i am not and then i am i wonder if that was death

i know lsd i dont need to take it anymore maybe when i die like aldous huxley

it wasnt his it wasnt my fault

we both had nothing except patience

but death has none

i saw him come how meanly

and i watched him as he took and took

none of it i could claim as mine

who journeyed to denver who died in denver who came back to denver  waited in vain who watched over denver  brooded and loned in denver and finally went away to find out the time  now denver is lonesome for her heroes

life is a long agonized illness only curable by death

there is uncertainty in hope but even with its tenuous nature it summons our strength and pulls us through fear and grief— and even death

i not afraid of dying im afraid of suffering

letter to his wife natalia sedova

im not scared of death i just dont want to seek it out

it is not because other people are dead that our affection for them grows faint it is because we ourselves are dying

every suicide is a solution to a problem

i always say if you must mount the gallows give a jest to the crowd a coin to the hangman and make the drop with a smile on your lips

hope in the beginning feels like such a violation of the loss and yet without it we couldnt survive

after all what is every man a horde of ghosts – like a chinese nest of boxes – oaks that were acorns that were oaks death lies behind us not in front – in our ancestors back and back until

so if there is something on the planet that is worth living for id better not miss it because once youre dead its too late for regrets and if you die by mistake that is really really dumb

what had happened still seemed implausible a person was present your entire life and then one day she disappeared and never came back it resisted belief

and thus we all are nighing

the truth we fear to know

death will end our crying

for friends that come and go

but after i got them to leave and shut the door and turned off the light it wasnt any good it was like saying goodby to a statue after a while i went out and left the hospital and walked back to the hotel in the rain

perhaps because it seems so appropriate i dont notice the rain it falls in sheets a blanket of silvery thread rushing to the hard almostwinter ground still i stand without moving at the side of the coffin

god is dead and i am his replacement

music links us humans heart to heartacross time and space and life and death

sweet as the tender fragrance that survives

when martyred flowers breathe out their little lives

sweet as a song that once consoled our pain

but never will be sung to us again

is they remembrance now the hour of rest

hath come to thee sleep darling it is best

dekka looked up straight into the glittering eyes of a coyote she could sense the others around her closing in wary but sensing that a fresh meal was close at hand

john have mercy i dont want to die

sita then you should never have been born

its unfair

as a rule life is unfair i said

yeah but i think i did say some awful things

to dick

let us think of people as starting life with an experience they forget and ending it with one which they anticipate but cannot understand

dont interfere the doctor silenced her angrily i cannot will my own destruction

if death said my father reasoning with himself is nothing but the separation of the soul from the bodyand if it is true that people can walk about and do their business without brainsthen certes the soul does not inhabit there

look at your own poverty

welcome it

cherish it

dont be afraid

share your death

because thus you will share your love and your life

she surveyed the carnage behind him did you have fun

he showed her his teeth yes

shes had a long life now shes going to the lord

frankly it creeps me out a little when you say things like that simon said

it shouldnt if you dont like lord pick another word shes going home shes going back to the party whatever you like

i suppose you have some definite ideas about an afterlife

sure we get reabsorbed into the earthly and celestial mechanism

no heaven

thats heaven

what about realms of glory what about walking around in golden slippers

waynes a little attached to that hat waxillium said he thinks its lucky

wayne it is lucky i aint never died while wearing that hat

marasi frowned i  im not sure i know how to respond

wax thats a common reaction to wayne

if i convert its because its better that a believer dies than that an atheist does

when i have fears that i may cease to be

when i have fears that i may cease to be

before my pen has glean’d my teeming brain

before high piled books in charact’ry

hold like rich garners the fullripen’d grain

when i behold upon the night’s starr’d face

and think that i may never live to trace

their shadows with the magic hand of chance

and when i feel fair creature of an hour

that i shall never look upon thee more

never have relish in the faery power

of unreflecting love—then on the shore

of the wide world i stand alone and think

till love and fame to nothingness do sink

tell her this

and more—

that the king of the seas

the bustling fates

heap his hands with corpses

until he stands like a child

with surplus of toys

she was made mostly of coffee and empty spaces

people are fragile they die of mistakes of overdoses of sickness but mostly they die of death

we all know were one day closer to the end when we wake up in the morning we just kid ourselves that its not happening

the knowledge of death seemed present in both sisters—it was something about the way they carried themselves something that had broken too soon and had not mended marking them in spite of their lightheartedness

in my life

why do i give valuable time

to people who dont care if i live or die

phaedra of alonso’s death was a neverending pain that gnawed at his insides it made him a prisoner in his own cottage

our planet is poorly equipped for delight

one must snatch gladness from the days that are

in this life

its not difficult to die

to make life

is more difficult by far

life sometimes reminds us that it is sometimes heartless by giving something or someone we really need to someone who does not need or even want them or it

our essence is change we are movement being out of balance is life

perfect balance stasis that is death

life yearns for perfection death is perfection

let your heart shine even more than your face the beautiful contents of your heart can never be forgotten but your face will be a history

there was something about other peoples grief that was so exposing so personal that she felt she shouldnt be looking

remembrance of things past is just for the rich for the poor it only marks the faint traces on the path to death

you are young and rich and have friends and at such an age i know it is hard to die

until now i had been able only to grieve not mourn grief was passive grief happened mourning the act of dealing with grief required attention

mom always said i was born to sit in the electric chair but im proving her wrong im going to die on my knees begging for my life

why so much grief for me no man will hurl me down to death against my fate and fate no one alive has ever escaped it neither brave man nor coward i tell you  it’s born with us the day that we are born

love taught me to die with dignity that i might come forth anew in splendor born once of flesh then again of fire i was reborn a third time to the sound of my name humming haikus in heaven’s mouth

each man is master of his own death and all that we can do when the time comes is to help him die without fear of pain

death waits for no man  and if he does he doesnt usually wait for very long

the first time is always the hardest

she doesnt wake up said boots

no not this time said gregor this time she had to go away

boots looked around at all their faces at hazard crying where did she go no one had an answer where is thalia when she doesnt wake up

the question hung in the air for an eternity finally it was howard who spoke up why shes in your heart boots

my heart said boots putting both hands on her chest

yes thats where she lives now said howard

she can fly away asked boots pressing her palms tightly against her heart as if to keep thalia from escaping

oh no she will stay there forever said howard

when a person has lived generously and fought fiercely she deserves more than sadness at the end

most people dont want to die but they dont want to live either i am speaking about men now as much as women they look for a third way but there is no third way

sleep the stepchild of death

if you really want to stay the same age you are now forever and ever shed be thinking try jumping off the roof deaths a surefire method for stopping time

hope is a horrible thing you know its a plague its like walking around with a fishhook in your mouth and someone just keep pulling it and pulling it

life and death what paltry words what tarnished bookendswhat unjust summation for drawing breath one moment and failing to release it the next

war is being reminded that you are completely at the mercy of death at every moment without the illusion that you are not without the distractions that make life worth living

life to be sure is nothing much to lose

but young men think it is and we were young

and then she moved from shock to grief the way she might enter another room

well i always did want to go out in a braveheart kind of way ill just have to think of something cool to yell before they cut my head off

so i heard the boom of my fathers rifle when he shot my best friend a bullet only costs about two cents and anybody can afford that

there are women whose love only ends with death

if christ taught us anything it is this  not to let our fear of death keep us from doing the good thing

cordelia stay a little ha what ist thou sayst her voice was ever soft

the dead are merely the countrymen of my future

failures plagued me things i had omitted or ignored neglected what i should have given and hadn’t i felt the biting pang of every unfulfillment

i was made to rule the darkness

how i wish i was like the water

flowing so freely with every drop

let my every emotion wonder

no need to start nor even stop

how i wish i was like the fire

burning with every flame up

as a phoenix raises its wings up

how i wish i was like the earth

raising each flower from the ground

seeing the beauty of death and birth

and then returning to the ground

how i wish i was like the wind

hearing each whisper sound and thought

a lonesome and wandering little wind

shattering all that has been sought

oh how i wish i was where you are

not separated by empty space so far

it seems like were galaxies apart

but we find hope within our heart

and how i wish i was all of the above

so i can come below and yet forget

the beauty of angels which come down like a dove

and demons who love with no regret

there would be no chance to get to know death at all if it happened only once

think of the glory think of your reputation think how great itll look on your next resume

on my cenotaph you mean nobody will be able to collect enough of my scattered atoms to bury you going to cover my funeral expenses son

splendidly banners dancing girls and enough beer to float your coffin to valhalla

miles coaxing ky tung to agree to an almost suicidal mission

it has been a week since ami died and this morning i woke suddenly hours before dawn indeed the same hour as when my mother died it was not a dream that woke me but a thought and with that thought i could swear i heard amis voice

that is what happened with ami and me this miracle of chance

under the brown fog of a winter dawn

a crowd flowed over london bridge so many

i had not thought death had undone so many

sighs short and infrequent were exhaled

and each man fixed his eyes before his feet

flowed up the hill and down king william street

to where st mary woolnoth kept the hours

with a dead sound on the final stock of nine

there i saw one i knew and stopped him crying stetson

you who were with me in the ships at mylae

that corpse you planted last year in your garden

has it begun to sprout will it bloom this year

or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed

oh keep the dog far hence thats friend to men

or with his nails hell dig it up again

you hypocrite lecteurmon semblablemon frere

because there is nothing here than invites us to cherish unhappy lovers nothing is more vain than to die for love what we ought to do is live

in the early morning on the lake sitting in the stern of the boat with his father rowing he felt quite sure that he would never die

deaths diary

it was a year for the ages like  like  to just name a few forget the scythe god damn it i needed a broom or a mop and i needed a holiday

death is not a reaper like they say nor even a friend it is a dark fierce water an inundation

if i knew i was going to die tomorrow

and spring came the day after tomorrow

i would die peacefully because it came the day after tomorrow

if that’s its time when else should it come

i like it that everything is real and everything is right

and i like that it would be like this even if i didn’t like it

and so if i die now i die peacefully

because everything is real and everything is right

doctor you do not fear death you think this makes you strong it makes you weak

bruce why

doctor how can you move faster then possible fight longer then possible without the most powerful impulse of the spirit the fear of death

brucei do fear death i fear dying in here while my city burns and theres no one there to save it

doctor then make the climb

bruce how

doctor as the child did  without the rope then fear will find you again

and let me ask you this the dead

where arent they

how we keep these dead souls in our hearts each one of us carries within himself his necropolis

they were people whose lives were slow who did not see themselves growing old or falling sick or dying but who disappeared little by little in their own time turning into memories mists from other days until they were absorbed into oblivion

when a country is defeated there remain only mountains and rivers and on a ruined castle in spring only grasses thrive i sat down on my hat and wept bitterly till i almost forgot time

is all that remains

of the dreams and ambitions

god waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward why then should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress when life is so soon over and death is so certain an entrance to happiness  to glory

every once in a while i get the urge you know what i’m talking about don’t you the urge for destruction the urge to hurt maim kill

when he left us he stole all the words

you have entered an abnormal lonely and unwelcome new world where you are nothing but an island of sadness

when people get a chance to come close to death without having it touch them personally they never miss the opportunity

much as oblivion is the death of sorrow

so death is lifes forgetfulness

since we live in the heads of those who remember us we lose control of our lives and become who they want us to be

it is life that hurts you not death

i like dancing of indian girls more than my parents’ prayers  because they dance with love and passion  but my parents just say their prayers because they got used to it

tonight i want to stand on the side of a cliff and look down dare the wind to gust and knock me off everyone thinks that falling to your death is the worst thing that can happen but that’s a lie the worst thing is to be alive for no reason

death is impatient and thoughtless it barges into your room when you are right in the middle of something and it doesnt bother to wipe its boots

when somebody goes away theres things you want to tell them when somebody dies maybe thats the worst thing you want to tell them things that happen after

you cant argue with the dead no matter what you say they always have the last word

the dream crossed twilight between birth and dying

dying for love might be pitiable but it wasnt much different finally from any other kind of dying

i watch my loved ones weep with sorrow

deaths silent torment of no tomorrow

i feel their hearts breaking i sense their despair

united in misery the grief that they share

how do i show that i am not gone

but the essence of lifes everlasting song

why do they wee why do they cry

im alive in the wind and i am soaring high

i am sparkling light dancing on streams

a moment of warmth in the fays of sunbeams

the coolness of rain as it falls on your face

the whisper of leaves as wind rushes with haste

eternal song a requiem by avian of celieria

from crown of crystal flame by cl wilson

then on your tombstone where you only get a little bit of space to sum up your life some waxfaced creep chisels a set of meaningless numbers instead of poetry or a secret love or the name of your favorite candy

in the end all you get is a few words

tread lightly she is near

under the snow

speak gently she can hear

the daisies grow

all her bright golden hair

tarnished with rust

she that was young and fair

fallen to dust

lilylike white as snow

she hardly knew

she was a woman so

sweetly she grew

lie on her breast

i vex my heart alone

she is at rest

peace peace she cannot hear

lyre or sonnet

all my life’s buried here

heap earth upon it

but… if i destroy you and your dreck script and i still exist… then my existence will be glorious for i will become my own master

love doesnt go anywhere when you die you know the person passes on the body withers but love it survives

death is woven in with the violets said louis death and again death

in life we sit at the table and refuse to eat and in death we are eternally hungry

thats how i want to go taking my own way out and totally pissing everybody off at the end

im sure we all have dreams of leaving at some time in our lives but when we reach the bottom most of us go running home

humanity was deadmaybe never live too

death in the horror movies is when the monsters get you

what we call time isnt chronological but spatial what we call death is merely a transition between different kinds of matter

anyone in this world can have the power of life and death over someone else its horrible but true all you need to do is take it and once you have  there is no going back the killers cousin

too easy to lose the way

too hard to keep from unraveling when there’s nothing to remind you of who you

are and where you should be

another eternity passes in the flick of an eyelash

but you said so yourselfthe poor lass will die of itdo you really want her to die

yes id rather she died than have a bad life

i dont want to die in darkness any thicker than this i want to bring some kind of resolution in my life

wouldn’t the joys of life lose all colour if life was eternal

how can nonexistence get sick of itself

i came in haste with cursing breath

and heart of hardest steel

but when i saw thee cold in death

i felt as man should feel

for when i look upon that face

that cold unheeding frigid brown

where neither rage nor fear has place

by heaven i cannot hate thee now

we all love conflagrations when the sky changes color it is a dead mans passing

you are a hole in my life a black hole anything i place there cannot be returned i miss you terribly ci vedremo lassu angelo

which natural gift would you most like to possess the ability to master other languages which would have hugely enhanced the scope of these answers

how would you like to die fully conscious and either fighting or reciting or fooling around

what do you most dislike about your appearance the way in which it makes former admirers search for neutral words

afterwards when its all over you meet god what do you say to god

time has always been the greatest ally to truth because time eventually relieves and reveals all

do you realise that people die of boredom in london suburbs its the second biggest cause of death amongs the english in general sheer boredom

if i could find one word

that would shudder the air

like that frightened sob

that wordless prayer

of my newlyborn

who drew one breath

and with unopened eyes

sank back into death

if i could break the worlds cold heart

with that cry

then this grief would lift

and i could die

quoting son noah levine once you see what the heart really needs it doesn’t matter if you’re going to live or die the work is always the same

he would find his susieinside his young son give that love to the living

and in such bliss does devastation grow

daddy didn’t say anything for a minute or so and then he reached up and caught a firefly as it glowed beside him see this light he asked me when the firefly lit up his hand

that light is bright enough to light up a little speck of the night sky so a man can see it a ways away that’s what god expects us to do we’re to be lights in the dark cold days that are this world like fireflies in december

no matter the selfconceited importance of our labors we are all compost for worlds we cannot yet imagine

vanye youre asking me to kill you

luthiel im asking you to save her

a persons life isnt orderly it runs about all over the place in and out through time the presents hardly there the future doesnt exist only love matters in the bits and pieces of a persons life

death of course is not a failure death is normal death may be the enemy but it is also the natural order of things

life is just a short period of time in which you are alive

i wish everyone would stop crying tom uncle joe would be so angry about it but shes crying herself now hed be so angry at us tom for crying so much when all he did was laugh

the healing power of even the most microscopic exchange with someone who knows in a flash precisely what youre talking about because she experienced that thing too cannot be overestimated

when you attempt suicide the counselors try to talk you out of trying it again by asking you about other people which is good prevention if you care about other people

a flower bloomed already wilting beginning its life with an early ending

nobody died how can you kill an idea how can you kill the personification of an action

then what died who are you mourning

everyone thought that things were getting back to normal they had no idea that normal didn’t exist for me any more normal had been smashed on the rocks beneath the bridge

would we trade all those pages for a single hour or all of our books for one real minute

is anyone whos supposed to be dead actually dead

… for overstrong was the command to hold fast to each smallest particle of time to the smallest particle of every circumstance and to embody all of them in memory as if they could be preserved in memory through all deaths for all times

the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword

it’s not that we have to quit

this life one day but it’s how

many things we have to quit

all at once music laughter

the physics of falling leaves

the scent of rain the concept

of subway trains if only one

could leave this life slowly

it was all very strange mr gray thought as he wiped the coffee canister clean with a sponge very very mysterious you were born you lived a whole life and at the end you wound up in a coffee canister

ah well he said out loud quietly thats just the way things are lifes a funny business death he supposed was the punch line

one day i wrote her name upon the strand

one day i wrote her name upon the strand

but came the waves and washèd it away

again i wrote it with a second hand

but came the tide and made my pains his prey

vain man said she that dost in vain assay

a mortal thing so to immortalise

for i myself shall like to this decay

and eke my name be wipèd out likewise

not so quod i let baser things devise

to die in dust but you shall live by fame

my verse your virtues rare shall eternise

and in the heavens write your glorious name

where when as death shall all the world subdue

our love shall live and later life renew

if she could have diedif she could have disappeared foreverbut the solid surface of things refused to dissolve around her and her body her hateful hermaphrodites body continued in its stubborn lumpen way to live

when shall i be dead and rid

of all the wrong my father did

how long how long till spade and hearse

put to sleep my mothers curse

i am not ready to die

but i am learning to trust death

as i have trusted life

i am moving

the snow filled the air with a soft greyblue mist softening the wind and gunfire bringing the earth and sky together into one swaying blur

this soft white snow settling over the carnage of the city was time itself the present was turning into the past and there was no future

shot in the eye

shot in the brain

shot in the ass

shot like a flower in the dance

amazing how death wins hands down

amazing how much credence is given to idiot forms of

amazing how laughter has been drowned out

amazing how viciousness is such a constant

i must soon declare my own war on their war

i must hold to my last piece of ground

i must protect the small space i have made that has

my life not their death

my death not their death

this place this time now

i vow to the sun

that i will laugh the good laugh once again

in the perfect place of me

their death not my life

theres not enough of anything to go around except people and death

listen being dead is not worse than being alive it is different though you could say the view is larger

i want away to the house of death to my father under the low clay roof

she was mad but no one had noticed now at last she had found tolya her joy was like that of a mothercat when she finds her dead kitten and licks it all over

a soul can live in torment for years and years even decades as it slowly stone by stone builds a mound over a grave as it moves towards the apprehension of eternal loss and bows down before reality

it would kill the past and when that was dead he would be free

stop sleeping get to work you will have much time to sleep when you die

why should i be sad everyone has to die if you have a body its too late to cry its only funerals i cant stand

for  million you could give everyone in scotland a shovel and we could dig a hole so deep we could hand her over to satan in person on margaret thatcher

why is it we have so little choice we live like the lowliest worms always defeated  defeated we make dinner we eat we sleep everyone we love is dying sill to cease living is unacceptable

from the time were born until we die were kept busy with artificial stuff that isnt important

there is only one true wealth in all the universeliving time

i will tell you what war is war is a psychosis caused by an inability to see relationships our relationship with our fellowmen our relationship with our economic and historical situation and above all our relationship to nothingness to death

i just found this world a hard place to be good in’ says bunny then he closes his eyes and with an expiration of breath goes still

for death is the meaning of night

the eternal shadow

into which all lives must fall

all hopes expire

a penny for my thoughts oh no ill sell them for a dollar

theyre worth so much more after im a goner

and maybe then youll hear the words i been singin

funny when youre dead how people start listenin

how soon will we accept this opportunity to be fully alive before we die

charitably i think sometimes perhaps one must change or die and in the end there were perhaps limits to how much he could let himself change

its okay to talk about it death is so normal i dont know why everyone gets so hung up about it we all have to deal with it most people that you talk to have lost someone but nobody talks about it

america was to them the place that good people went to when they died they were prepared to believe just about anything could happen in america

anyway lots of warrior tribes think that when they die they go to a heavenly land somewhere said the toad you know where they can drink and fight and feast forever so maybe this is theirs

but this is a real place

so thats what they believe besides theyre only small maybe the universe is a bit crowded and they have to put heavens anywhere theres room im a toad so youll appreciate that im having to guess a lot here

who knoweth if to die be but to live and that called life by mortals be but death

death truly does have life and walks with and lives through us everyday

if you can overcome love you can overcome fear if you can overcome fear you can overcome death

mist to mist drops to drops for water thou art and unto water shalt thou return

i thought of the stern victorian determination to keep death in mind the uncompromising tombstones

remember pilgrim as you pass by

as you are now so once was i

as i am so will you be

in a world where everyone struggles to survive whatever the cost how could one judge those who decide to die

the day after paul newman was dead he was twice as dead

nor dread nor hope attend

dreading and hoping all

with rue my heart is laden

with rue my heart is laden

for golden friends i had

for many a roselipt maiden

and many a lightfoot lad

by brooks too broad for leaping

the lightfoot boys are laid

the roselipt girls are sleeping

in fields where roses fade

im allen walker

my lifeis overim going to die

wasnt it after all a kind of life

and there were houses he knew it that breathed they carried in their wood and stone their brick and mortar a kind of ego that was nearly very nearly human

how talented was death how many expressions and manipulations of hand face body no two alike

im going to get im not fucking dead tattooed on my chest

that will become inaccurate at some point  omar pointed out

we are all dying one by one we all smell of mortality and we cant wash it off

the effects of loss are acute and unique to each individual not everyone mourns in the same way but everyone mourns

tired of life afraid of death not unlike

a lost brig toy of ebb and flow on the ocean

my soul weighs anchor for a frightful shipwreck

the dead has only one place to go… up wherever you bury them they will go the same way up

no individual death among human beings is important someone who dies leaves his work behind and that does not entirely die it never entirely dies as long as humanity exists

its a tragic fact to die in an accident

you people have a religion of death that fills you with the joy and courage to confront iti do not i believe the only essential thing is to be alive abrenucio

he dreamed of funeral love but dreams crumble and the tomb abides

dont say passed away i tell him drawing from my own terrible well of experience say he died death is horrible we shouldnt give it a pretty name

the little war

how can there be

are some deaths

smaller than others

who weep

why is it okay to put someone to death but it’s not okay for those people to do it themselves

they suffered with his death and she  she suffered with their reaction to it

my faceless neighbor spoke up

don’t be deluded hitler has made it clear that he will annihilate all jews before the clock strikes twelve

what do you care what he said would you want us to consider him a prophet

his cold eyes stared at me at last he said wearily

i have more faith in hitler than in anyone else he alone has kept his promises all his promises to the jewish people

when the star dies

its eye closes tired of watching

it flies back to its first bright dream

death is a state of mindmany people on earth spend their entire lives dead

here lies one from a distant star but the soil is not alien to him for in death he belongs to the universe

what i have learned lately is that people deal with death in all sorts of ways some of us fight against it doing everything we can to make it not true some of us lose our selves to grief some of us lose ourselves to anger

think about that for a moment they died for you now take a good look at the life youre living and tell me did they do the right thing

you and i have a connection that nothing not on heaven or earth or even hell could ever break if you want to talk to me talk to me i’ll hear you…

poor boy i never knew you yet i think i could not refuse this moment to die for you if that would save you

there is not a day or night but a doe offers her life for her kittens or some honest captain of owsla his life for his chief rabbits sometimes it is taken sometimes it is not but there is no bargain for here what is is what must be

however cozy things seemed the facts of life were the same you couldnt escape death it would get us all in the end

i wonder if it will rain after we die when you kill yourself you dont know what happens next afterward

i thinki think its always been you who was dying delaney

theres still a thousand places i havent gone to die

dreams link us to those who have already left this life

she cannot possibly be dead people do not just die

what is life it departs covertly like a thief death took him

love doesnt always mean rings and veils and walks down the aisle

sometimes love means broken windows and broken hearts

and not being able to fix either

and sometimes love means telling you

theres no such thing as time in heaven so dont rush to meet me

stay a while and pick girl the roses

his life spells living your life or my life apart from him spells death

it was one thing to live in a world where death stood a distant figure quite another to hold it in your hands

then deborah stood at the wicket gate the boundary and there was a woman with outstretched hand demanding tickets

pass through she said when deborah reached her we saw you coming the wicket gate became a turnstile deborah pushed against it and there was no resistance she was through

what is it she asked am i really here at last is this the bottom of the pool

it could be smiled the woman there are so many ways you just happened to choose this one

other people were pressing to come through they had no faces they were only shadows deborah stood aside to let them by and in a moment they had gone all phantoms

why only now tonight asked deborah why not in the afternoon when i came to the pool

its a trick said the woman you seize on the moment in time we were here this afternoon were always here our life goes on around you but nobody knows it the tricks easier by night thats all

am i dreaming then asked deborah

no said the woman this isnt a dream and it isnt death either its the secret world

the secret world it was something deborah had always known and now the pattern was complete the memory of it and the relief were so tremendous that something seemed to burst inside her heart

everything but a life can be replaced

there is no man so blessed that some who stand by his deathbed wont hail the occasion with delight

death is a lot like prom  loud overdone and although the guy you came with was cool you never know wholl end up taking you home

death is never swift no matter how those left behind would like to comfort themselves with the thought before ever after

kill you all the clown was laughing and screaming try to stop me and ill kill you all drive you crazy and then kill you all you cant stop me

fight on brave knights man dies but glory lives fight on death is better than defeat fight on brave knights for bright eyes behold your deeds

if life is a punishment one should wish for an end if life is a test one should wish it to be short

never use abstract nouns when concrete ones will do if you mean more people died don’t say mortality rose

death and destruction are necessary to the health of the world and therefore as natural and lovable as birth and life only priests and born cowards moan and weep over dying brave men face it with approving nonchalance

had i truly thought i would not die when he kissed me but i did for a moment the breath and life went out of me and there was no time and no tomorrow but only my lips against his

and the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay and the flames of the tripods expired and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all

at the end one didnt remember life as a whole but as just a string of moments

its time old captain lift anchor sink

the land rots we shall sail into the night

if now the sky and sea are black as ink

our hearts as you must know are filled with light

only when we drink poison are we well —

we want this fire so burns our brain tissue

to drown in the abyss — heaven or hell

who cares through the unknown well find the new le voyage

with mind distracted never thinking death is coming

to slave away on the pointless business of mundane life

and then to come out emptyit is a tragic error

trans by robert thurman

life dies but forever will there be music always

the field of the soul must be watered by the rain with tears of love otherwise it will become a desert

the landscape is best described as pedestrian hostile its pointless to try to take a walk so i generally just stay in the room and think about shooting myself in the head

you havent lost iraki you know i dont know if it helps to say that i lost a friend once myself and i know how it goes

hell find his way inside you and youll carry him onward behind your heartbeat youll hear another one faint and out of step people will say you are speaking his opinions or your hair has turned like his

gradually youll grow older than him and love him as your son

how did your mother die asked delk

pather told you katie nodded delk was glad pather had told his sister she was relieved not to have to tell the story again does it ever    you know    get any better

katie shrugged her narrow shoulders and smiled in some ways it does but it’s a bit like running a long race with a rock in your shoe you get used to it but it always hurts a little

not since north korean media declared kim jongil to be the reincarnation of kim il sung has there been such a blatant attempt to create a necrocracy or perhaps mausolocracy in which a living claimant assumes the fleshly mantle of the departed

in so many senseless deaths beauty is to blame

i dedicate this to all those who did not live to tell it and may they please forgive me for not having seen it all nor remembered it all for not having divined all of it  from the gulag archipelago

please not yet those are the three eternal words please not yet

having second thoughts puck’s voice was soft and dangerous a far cry from his normal flippancy i thought we put this behind us for now

i have never lived a life so much larger than death

just being alive should make you late for everything in case youve never noticed the dead are always on time

oh danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling

from glen to glen and down the mountain side

the summers gone and all the flowers are dying

tis you tis you must go and i must bide

but come ye back when summers in the meadow

or when the valleys hushed and white with snow

tis ill be here in sunshine or in shadow

oh danny boy oh danny boy i love you so

and if you come when all the flowers are dying

and i am dead as dead i well may be

youll come and find the place where i am lying

and kneel and say an ave there for me

and i shall hear tho soft you tread above me

and all my dreams will warm and sweeter be

if youll not fail to tell me that you love me

ill simply sleep in peace until you come to me

ill simply sleep in peace until you come to me

and no child deserved to die for defending her father no matter who she was

had a million things to do today death would have to wait

you are afraid to die

this is my child he said i wash a dead mans brains out of his hair that is my job

the chorus line

we are the maids

the ones you killed

the ones you failed

we danced in air

our bare feet twitched

it was not fair

with every goddess queen and bitch

from there to here

you scratched your itch

we did much less

than what you did

you judged us bad

you had the spear

you had the word

at your command

we scrubbed the blood

of our dead

paramours from floors from chairs

from stairs from doors

we knelt in water

while you stared

at our bare feet

it was not fair

you licked our fear

it gave you pleasure

you raised your hand

you watched us fall

we danced on air

the ones you failed

the ones you killed

nicholson nodded whats the point exactly

the point is if his dog really died it would be exactly the same thing only he wouldnt know it i mean he wouldnt wake up till he died himself

not flowers—never flowers in terrasen instead they carried small stones to graves to mark their visits to tell the dead that they still remembered

stones were eternal—flowers were not

elaborate burial customs are a sure sign of decadence

dance my darling dance if you dance then death cant catch you nothing bad can touch you dance

achieving the state of sable is not as many people who live with these knitters believe a reason to stop buying yarn but for the knitter it is an indication to write a will bequeathing the stash to an appropriate heir

now when i die i shall only be dead

let not the rash marble risk

garrulous breaches of oblivions omnipotence

all those glass jewels are best left in the dark

let not the marble say what men do not

the essentials of the dead mans life

the trembling hope

the implacable miracle of pain the wonder of sensual delight

will abide forever

blindly the uncertain soul asks to continue

when it is the lives of others that will make that happen

as you yourself are the mirror and image

of those who did not live as long as you

and others will be and are your immortality on earth

the reason they invented coffins to lock the dead in preserve them they put makeup on them they didnt want them spreading or changing into anything else the stone with the name and date was on them to weight them down

only the previous day arch had found him in a spiritdance corral blistering the creatures to the point of death such was his need to touch and destroy

and now  now it only remains for me to light a cigarette and go home dear god only now am i remembering that people die does that include me

dont forget in the meantime that this is the season for strawberries yes

that cake tasted good but the cake in the garbage tasted better it was the best cake i ever ate

the meeting between ignorance and knowledge between brutality and culture  it begins in the dignity with which we treat the dead

kate lost a mother i said but i lost a nothing

kate doesnt feel that way jack assured me

but what about everybody else besides kate how can i ever explain to anyone what she was when she and i had no name people need names for everything i wasnt a relative or a friend i was just an object of her kindness

he wiped my cheeks saying ssshh i buried my face in his shoulder

youre the one now jack said definitively thats why you met her she had something she had to pass on p

the question of how to spend my life of what my life is for is a question posed only to me and i can no more delegate the responsibility for answering it than i can delegate the task of dying

im going to die and as if that werent bad enough im going to die inside a cake

it’s quite simple death isn’t what we think it is it isn’t life which ends but time which stops

all bettes stories have happy endings thats because she knows where to stop shes realized the real problem with stories—if you keep them going long enough they always end in death

the graves a fine and private place

but none i think do there embrace

steal from the world and not a stone

tell where i lie

but at my back i always hear

time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near

and yonder all before us lie

thy beauty shall no more be found

nor in thy marble vault shall sound

my echoing song then worms shall try

that longpreserved virginity

and your quaint honour turn to dust

and into ashes all my lust

the grave’s a fine and private place

but none i think do there embrace

around around the sun we go

the moon goes round the earth

we do not die of death

cauldron save you

mother hold you

pass through the gates and smell that immortal land of milk and honey

fear no evil

feel no pain

go and enter eternity

one night he sits up in cots around him are a few dozen sick or wounded a warm september wind pours across the countryside and sets the walls of the tent rippling

silver and blue blue and silver

the voice of volkheimer what you could be

werner’s body seems to have gone weightless under his blanket and beyond the flapping tent doors the trees dance and the clouds keep up their huge billowing march and he swings first one leg and then the other off the edge of the bed

ernst says the man beside him ernst but there is no ernst the men in the cots do not reply the american soldier at the door of the tent sleeps werner walks past him into the grass

the wind moves through his undershirt he is a kite a balloon

it’s all right he told her things hardly ever work on the first try we’ll make another a better one

did they he hopes they did he seems to remember a little boat—a more seaworthy one—gliding down a river it sailed around a bend and left them behind didn’t it

why doesn’t the wind move the light

across the field an american watches a boy leave the sick tent and move against the background of the trees he sits up he raises his hand

stop he calls

halt he calls

but werner has crossed the edge of the field where he steps on a trigger land mine set there by his own army three months before and disappears in a fountain of earth

the angel of death is always a young person or a group of young people youll begin seeing them left and right soon

who wanted to be smiled at by the girl that trailed shadows like pets conjured snakes and waited for death her bridegroom to steal her from these walls

hope is the great deceiver hope is the piper who leads us sleepy to our slaughter

but before you start pointing fingers let me ask you is what i did really so bad so bad i deserved to die so bad i deserved to die like that

is what i did really so much worse than what anybody else does

is it really so much worse than what you do

think about it

for truly the man who does not know when to die does not know how to live

trying to show that you have mental illness to somebody who’s never had it is like trying to describe a new color to the colorblind

thousands of people are being buried and no one attends the funerals said one of the soldiers in peacetime its the other way round one coffin and a hundred people carrying flowers

there are times when im doing qi and im going ha ha yeah yeah and inside im going i want to fucking die i … want … to … fucking … die

for what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and melt into the sun

if you can kill it or it can kill you its real

oh god alaska i love you i love you and the colonel whispered im so sorry pudge i know you did and i said no not past tense she wasnt even a person anymore just flesh rotting but i loved her present tense

harry potter he said very softly his voice might have been part of the spitting fire the boy who lived

none of the death eaters moved they were waiting everything was waiting hagrid was struggling and bellatrix was panting and harry thought inexplicably of ginny and her blazing look and the feel of her lips on his

he saw the mouth move and a flash of green light and everything was gone

to be alive it seemed to me as i stood there in all kinds of sorrow was to be both original and reflection and to be dead was to be split off to be reflection alone

the times that were most fun seemed always to be followed by sadness now because it was when life started to feel like it did when she was with us that we realized how utterly gone she was

they died together theyll always be remembered together its decided once and for all he was hers

healthy children will not fear life if their elders have integrity enough not to fear death

i looked at the stainedglass image of the lamb in the window above me but that only reminded me that lambs are famous for being led to slaughter or sometimes hanging out with lions in illadvised relationships

when we see death we see disaster when jesus sees death he sees deliverance

the lucky ones are just born dead

a man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right

i have every reason to be sad but i dont have any reason to mourn people grieve when things end nothing has ended tonight one of us has simply gone ahead as we always knew it would have to be

he must not merely cling to life for then he will be a coward and will not escape he must not merely wait for death for then he will be a suicide and will not escape he must seek his life in a spirit of furious indifference to it

was it not worth the loss of a little immortality to have that strange mix of innocence and strength close to him

now that her spirit had left i’d thought she would feel light then i realized it was the spirit that carries the weight of the body and not the other way around

death is but crossing the world as friends do the seas they live in one another still

the most ruthless of all humans are the ones cornered in by death

o earth lie heavily upon her eyes

seal her sweet eyes weary of watching earth

lie close around her leave no room for mirth

with its harsh laughter nor for sound of sighs

she hath no questions she hath no replies

the awful thing is that if i can forget theyre people it will be no different at all

a little muzhik was working on the railroad mumbling in his beard

death cuts off possibilities even if they were possibilities you never meant to act on it feels different

when they’re gone

he thought he saw some horses too and a clown but it was the faces of all those dead raptors that really bothered him and maybe that clown a little bit

her absence is like the sky spread over everything

death i need my little addiction to you i need that tiny voice who even as i rise from the sea all woman all there says kill me kill me

come here let me share a bit of wisdom with you

have you given much thought to our mortal condition

probably not why would you well listen

all mortals owe a debt to death

theres no one alive

who can say if he will be tomorrow

our fate moves invisibly a mystery

no one can teach it no one can grasp it

accept this cheer up have a drink

but dont forget aphroditethats one sweet goddess

you can let the rest go am i making sense

i think so how about a drink

put on a garland im sure

the happy splash of wine will cure your mood

were all mortal you know think mortal

because my theory is theres no such thing as life

its just catastrophe

here the whole world stars water air

and field and forest as they were

like cast off clothes was left behind

in ashes yet with hopes that she

reborn from holy poverty

resume them on her easter day

death is no enemy but the foundation of gratitude sympathy and art of all lifes pleasures only love owes no debt to death

i dont think that science and the paranormal have to be at war in fact its crucial that they work together it seems naïve to believe that the world is exactly as it seems

the father hesitated only a moment he felt the vague pain in his chest if i run he thought what will happen is death important no everything that happens before death is what counts and weve done fine tonight even death cant spoil it

death is a bored clerk with too many orders to fill there is no reckoning no profound moment it creeps up on us from behind and snatches us away while we shit

the foolish rush to end their lives

only the steadfast soul survives

the people one loves should take all their things with them when they die

youve got to think of the fine times you had with your mate not the moment of his perishin every tear you shed now only wets his windin sheet and disturbs his rest

because i could not stop for death he kindly stopped for me or paused at least to strike a glancing blow with his skyblue mouth as he passed

a third of three had died in his bunk of natural causesfor a dagger in the heart quite naturally ends ones life

what can i say i prefer to die well informed

knackered inmates are easier to control than pumpedup ones and dead inmates are even easier to control if you follow me

we love ourselves notwithstanding our faults and we ought to love our friends in like manner

la kills people jacaranda said youre lucky youre leaving youll be able to write

sprawled out on the front lawn looking up at an ordinary sky it could fall on me and somehow be the day i didnt die

in my world death will come chasing in your world it will start whispering in your ear to destroy yourself i know this because it started whispering to me when i was in the detention center

when your demon was yourself there really was no way to fight or get rid of it

prate not to me of suicide faint heart in battle not for pride i say endure but that such end denied makes welcomer yet the death thats to be died

red lips are not so red as the stained stones kissed by the english dead

then as his planet killed him it occurred to kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error

death ends a life but it does not end a relationship which struggles on in the survivor’s mind toward some final resolution some clear meaning which it perhaps never finds

o my love my wife

death that hath suckd the honey of thy breath

hath had no power yet upon thy beauty

talk to me about the truth of religion and ill listen gladly talk to me about the duty of religion and ill listen submissively but dont come talking to me about the consolations of religion or i shall suspect that you dont understand

the calla lilies are in bloom again such a strange flower—suitable to any occasion i carried them on my wedding day and now i place them here in memory of something that has died

truly the universe is full of ghosts not sheeted churchyard spectres but the inextinguishable elements of individual life which having once been can never die though they blend and change and change again for ever

and when suddenly

the god stopped her and with anguish in his cry

uttered the words ‘he has turned round’ –

she comprehended nothing and said softly ‘who

just remember what the french say no probably not the french theyve got a president or something the brits maybe or the swedes you know what i mean

no matthew what do they say

the king is dead thats what they say the king is dead long live the king

its important to attend funerals it is important to view the body they say and to see it committed to earth or fire because unless you do that the loved one dies for you again and again

he did not know that the old one was his father for such a relationship was utterly beyond his understanding but as he looked at the emaciated body he felt a dim disquiet that was the ancestor of sadness

ah lifes little surprises they can make any day unforgettable or make it your last

live die something else lives the very soil humanity walks upon is built up from death digging into a flowerbed means digging into bones

dante evergreens arent supposed to die

good thing im aging otherwise id be dead

love is like a flower its upright when its in harmony and withered when its dead

the thin line between life and death is still under construction

the candle glimmers but an hour the night

looms in its ancient hunger would you know

the tragedy of human love and need

gaze on the stars then on a brothers face

i wonder how it takes you that moment when everything turns to shadows  somerled

she had died at age twelve and by now she was nothing but the memory of love nothing now but bones

i think about dying every day because i cant stop thinking about living

ive grieved enough for his life cut short and for mine for running on for so long with so little in it its weakness now but i suppose i am crying out of a general sense of loss maybe i am mourning for the human condition

the painful truth about life is not death but death while you are alive

there is sorrow enough in the natural way

from men and woman to fill our day

but when we are certain of sorrow in store

why do we always arrange for more

brothers  sisters i bid you beware

of giving your heart to a dog to tear

watch birth and death

the lotus has already

opened its flower

would that the dead were not dead but there is grass that must be eaten pellets that must be chewed hraka that must be passed holes that must be dug sleep that must be slept

whenever richard cory went down town

we people on the pavement looked at him

he was a gentleman from sole to crown

and he was always quietly arrayed

and he was always human when he talked

but still he fluttered pulses when he said

goodmorning and he glittered when he walked

and he was richyes richer than a king

and admirably schooled in every grace

in fine we thought that he was everything

to make us wish that we were in his place

so on we worked and waited for the light

and went without the meat and cursed the bread

and richard cory one calm summer night

went home and put a bullet through his head

vivo sin vivir en mí muero porque no muero i live without really being alive i die because i am not dying

a man was on his way to the gallows when he met another who asked him where are you going my friend and the condemned man replied im not going anywhere theyre taking me by force

heaven is a place where all the dogs youve ever loved come to greet you

i love death because life hates me

he was no different from the dark things in the boundary a bringer of death

when i was a little girl i said sitting down the wallpaper in my room had pictures of noahs story

your fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he stands before the king whose hand is to be laid upon him in honour

dear as remembered kisses after death

and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feignd

on lips that are for others deep as love

deep as first love and wild with all regret

o death in life the days that are no more

we are graced with a godlike ability to transcend time and space in our minds but are chained to death

i am dying now but i still have many things to say

do you know where your breakthrough begins your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends

if you dont fear death then let kieran meet it

song after battle

as the young men went by

i was looking for him

it surprises me anew

that he has gone

it is something

to which i cannot be reconciled

owls hoot at me

owls hoot at me

that is what i hear

in my life

wolves howl at me

wolves howl at me

that is what i hear

in my life

science ask facts and religion ask faith humans are confused between life and death

the fame of his likes circulates briskly but soon grows heavy and stale and as for history it will limit his life story to the dash between two dates

getting a second life is one thing making a better life thats the trick

who shall tell the ladys grief

when her cat was past relief

who shall number the hot tears

who shall say the dark dismay

which her dying caused that day

she loved me

and inspired me

with transcending devotion

it was a blessing

to have been her son

to have been loved

her words of wisdom

opened my eyes

to the world

and to myself

by seeing the best in me

she empowered me

by believing in me

she transformed me

she grew old

and floated away

but her love remains standing

eternally by my side

every man believes to some extent that the world began when he was born and at the moment of leaving it suffers at having to let the universe remain unfinished

silence is a lie that screams at the light

where they burn books at the end they also burn people

it was said that life was cheap in ankhmorpork this was of course completely wrong life was often very expensive you could get death for free

the dead man is on the trolley and the woman collapses across his chest thats what the ghouls want a shufti at like at that princess dianas funeral they want to scrutinise those who really knew her to drink the misery out of their faces

pain unless it is physical was sold to you by your culture

i dont say goodbye very easily anna not gracefully or prettilygoodbye tears your heart out and leaves it a feast for carrion birds who happen by

i wish i could fly like that hawk rising and falling with the still spaces in the air far above all this sickness and death and evil

i wish i could recommend the experience of not being killed to everyone

when its my time and the reaper calls my name there will be no stink of fear on me and my only wish will be to die with grace covered in the blood of my enemies

this was how an enemy should be dealt with with a dagger not a declaration

hell i dont want to grow old at all i never want to die

i prefer my history dead dead history is writ in ink the living sort in blood

do you want to die old and craven in your bed

how else though not till im done reading

death was kind he drew a sharp breath but no father should have to give such a kindness to his child

do you actually think that how long a person grieves is a measure of how much they loved someone

who sir asked paramore puzzled

why his sister john his sister

the idea that all souls are mortal is the only notion surely terminating love and all its forms

if i must go

if i must go to heavens end

climbing the ages like a stair

be near me and forever bend

with the same eyes above me there

time will fly past us like leaves flying

we shall not heed for we shall be

knowing and known unchangeably

to what purpose should i trouble myself in searching out the secrets of the stars having death or slavery continually before my eyes

please don´t drown into his fears his concrete fists don´t let him again break the bridge of your nose with his cruel born hits then disappear into that mask of misery

under the brown fog of a winter dawn

a crowd flowed over london bridge so many

i had not thought death had undone so many

is there life before death that’s chalked up

in ballymurphy competence with pain

coherent miseries a bite and a sup

we hug our little destiny again

usually the things that kill us are the things we do every single day

human efforts to avoid or overcome death are always doomed to disappointment

you may die a hundred deaths without a break in the mental turmoil or you may keep your body and die only in the mind the death of the mind is the birth of wisdom

once very near the end i said if you can  if it is allowed  come to me when i too am on my death bed allowed she said heaven would have a job to hold me and as for hell id break it into bits

here be dragons to be slain here be rich rewards to gain

if we perish in the seeking why how small a thing is death

when it comes you’ll be dreaming

that you don’t need to breathe

that breathless silence is

the music of the dark

and it’s part of the rhythm

to vanish like a spark

death is not a checkmate…it is more like a carnival trick you cannot win no matter how you move your queen

what if its as simple as one moment one tiny thing like that kiss on the rocks what if id kissed him a little longer would he be alive right now or what if id stayed with him friday night what if id been with him… wherever he was

you may say suicide is a loss of control and cowardly foolish as it may sound i am prepared to argue

romeo courage man the hurt cannot be much

mercutio no tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a churchdoor but tis enough twill serve ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man

we live we love we let it go

im not courting death ive far too many books left to read

harry lost any sense of where they were streetlights above him yells around him he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life hedwig’s cage the firebolt and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees —

no — hedwig

no — no

the motorbike zoomed forward harry glimpsed hooded death eaters scattering as hagrid blasted through their circle

but the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage

i want to stop running away from everything

i want to find something to run toward

ill never be ready yet at the same time you always want to reach the end you cant fly to a destination and linger in the air i want to reach the end of this thing and i feel terrible about it

when you die do you want to feel ashamed of what youve done with your life feel ashamed of what your life meant

beastly of him to die before you realized he might be fascinating

death is a part of life they are dancing together the dance of infinity in front of the gates of time we can live our dreams as we are dreaming our future time is the endless consciousness

we understand death for the first time when he puts his hand upon one whom we love

we are only an instant thats true but we are eternal

i could kill you a thousand times over abraham but we would never be even you took everything i had

everything worthwhile ends we are in the perpetual process now creation maturation cessation

rosencrantz my lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king

hamlet the body is with the king but the king is not with the body the king is a thing

guildenstern a thing my lord

hamlet of nothing bring me to him hide fox and all after

it doesnt matter how much his mother loves him love is not enough to keep any of us alive

fear leads to death as the window to the courtyard jump

thats what death is danny thought wanting to talk to someone and not being able to

poets never die i thought they just fail in the end

for what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun

and what is it to cease breathing but to free the breath from its restless tides that it may rise and expand and seek god unencumbered

only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing

and when you have reached the mountaintopthen you shall begin to climb

and when the earth shal claim your limbsthen shall you truly dance

oh there has to be something in the stocking that makes a noise said death otherwise what is  am for

because i could not stop for death

he kindly stopped for me

the carriage held but just ourselves

and immortality

we slowly drove he knew no haste

and i had put away

my labour and my leisure too

for his civility

we passed the school where children played

their lessons scarcely done

we passed the fields of gazing grain

we passed the setting sun

we paused before a house that seemed

a swelling of the ground

the roof was scarcely visible

the cornice but a mound

since then tis centuries but each

feels shorter than the day

i first surmised the horses heads

were toward eternity

now every mortal has pain

and sweat is constant

but if there is anything dearer than being alive

its dark to me

we humans seem disastrously in love with this thing

whatever it is that glitters on the earth

we call it life we know no other

the underworlds a blank

and all the rest just fantasy

ive developed into quite a swan im one of those people that will probably look better and better as i get older  until i drop dead of beauty

and so we did

my flesh winced in cowardice from such a death

immortality like this is about as useful as sunscreen on a submarine

you smile upon your friend today

today his ills are over

you hearken to the lovers say

and happy is the lover

tis late to hearken late to smile

but better late than never

i shall have lived a little while

before i die for ever

the sharp knife of a short life well

ive had just enough time

time has transfigured them into

untruth the stone fidelity

they hardly meant has come to be

their final blazon and to prove

our almostinstinct almost true

what will survive of us is love

whatever distinguishes one lump of flesh from another when were alive were all the same once were dead just usedup shells

could i tell them i was sorry their loved one was dead when he’d tried to kill me there was no rule of etiquette for this even my grandmother would have been stymied

there are only two things worse then an empty canvas death and taxes

man he said im not afraid of graveyards the dead are just you know people who wanted the same things you and i want

what do we want i asked blurrily

aw man you know he said we just want well the same things these people wanted

what was that

he shrugged to live i guess he said

the nuclear family from across the street which as a result of decay truly did have  kids

death is the force that will create your new life it is a mechanism of transformation welcome it

susans gotta poker you know it said as if anxious to be helpful

well well indeed my goodness me

i fortthought all of you knew that now larstlast week she picked up a bogey by its nose

death tried to imagine this he felt sure hed heard the sentence wrong but it didnt sound a whole lot better however he rearranged the words

when i woke up in a pool of sweat i couldnt remember a thing maddy had said

for the first time in my life i tasted death and death tasted bitter for death is birth is fear and dread of some terrible renewal

you are going to end up as one of those sad old men who poke around in rubbish bins

i’m going to end up in a hole in the ground and so are you so are we all

so long as human beings stay human death and life are the same thing

…but there they lay sprawled across the field craved far more by the vultures than by wives

what he meant of course was that there would always be wars that they were as easy to stop as glaciers i believe that too

and even if wars didnt keep coming like glaciers there would still be plain old death

bod shrugged so he said its only death i mean all of my best friends are dead

the reaper does not listen to the harvest

that was it shogo stopped breathing the dim yellow light falling from the ceiling of the pilothouse shone on his pale face he seemed at ease

shogo shuya yelled he still had more to say youll see keiko youll be happy with her youre

it was too late shogo couldnt hear anything anymore but his face just looked so damned peaceful

damn it shuyas lips trembled along with his words damn it

holding shogos hands noriko was crying

someone dying asks if there is life after death yes comes the answer only not yours

…she kissed me on my thin lips and all my words were pushed back into my mouth

i don’t want to die she whispered but i need to lose the shackles of this multitude of hearts

what for is this box padded is it to be sat on can it be that it is catflavoured

forget it never explain never apologize you can either write posthumously or you cant

the young open the paper to forget about life by reading the funny strips the old do it to forget about death by reading other peoples obits my advice dont open the paper and go on with your life

we have long become overgrown with calluses we no longer hear people being killed x

thats it then this is how it ends i havent even read proust

we cant be sad for her she murmured only for ourselves at having to say goodbye

losing chloe had been like reading a wonderfulook only to realize that all the pages past a certain point were blank

hourly if youve

got the energy

of all the ways i had imagined my death getting beaten by my zombified mentor while trapped by a cannibalistic window handle wasn’t one of them

like many people i feel like celebrating remember this feeling it is human and can help us understand when others express bloodlust

seeing a woman cough today made me sense a vague fear of death

feel completely unable to do anything try to picture your life in five years it really seems like you will be dead

well as to that all ill say is you cant take out a fellows heart before hes ready to give it up

o that this too too solid flesh would melt

thaw and resolve itself into a dew

or that the everlasting had not fixd

his canon gainst selfslaughter o god god

how weary stale flat and unprofitable

seem to me all the uses of this world

fie ont ah fie tis an unweeded garden

that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature

possess it merely that it should come to this

but two months dead nay not so much not two

so excellent a king that was to this

hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother

that he might not beteem the winds of heaven

visit her face too roughly heaven and earth

must i remember why she would hang on him

as if increase of appetite had grown

by what it fed on and yet within a month

let me not think ontfrailty thy name is woman

a little month or ere those shoes were old

with which she followd my poor fathers body

like niobe all tearswhy she even she

o god a beast that wants discourse of reason

would have mournd longermarried with my uncle

my fathers brother but no more like my father

than i to hercules within a month

ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears

had left the flushing in her galled eyes

she married o most wicked speed to post

with such dexterity to incestuous sheets

it is not nor it cannot come to good

but break my heart for i must hold my tongue

birth and death  what could be more monstrous than that we like to deceive ourselves and call it wondrous and beautiful and majestic but its freakish lets face it

the spirit who inhabits her animates us all destroy the host you destroy the power the young die first the old wither slowly the eldest perhaps would go last but she is the queen of the damned and the damned cant live without her

the better and more realistic test would therefore seem to be in what cause or on what principle would you risk your life

death is the sanction of everything the storyteller can tell he has borrowed his authority from death

just know i am

not there to catch you

but i am there for you

in a world where the dead have returned to life the word trouble loses much of its meaning

death is not the end death can never be the end death is the road life is the traveller the soul is the guide

for if the darkness and corruption leave

a vestige of the thoughts that once i had

better by far you should forget and smile

than that you should remember and be sad

in every person there is a doer and a devil with every passing days the doer dies and a devil has to rise

the day she was bornher grandfather made her a ring of silver and a polished stone because he loved her already

because there was only one thing worse than dying and that was knowing you were going to die and where and how death ship

can i just say that dying sucks all that bullshit about seeing the light and having this inner peace blah blah blah its crap

and here face down beneath the sun

and here upon earths noonward height

to feel the always coming on

the always rising of the night

if i could make a dream real i would not kill anything unless it could never be changed at heart

keisuke its alright for you to kill someone

akira as long as they have tags according to the rules if theres three people present its an official battle im not sure how youre supposed to start it though

keisuke so killing people is just a game huh

akira its the only way to survive

if you remembered somebody was as real as yourself how could you kill anybody

you cant drown yourself that simply all good suicides involve speed and irreversibility because the body will always move to protect itself against the sicko mind trying to do it in

the dead do not harm us only the alive

be sure that head and heart were laid

in wisdom down content to die

be sure he faced the starless sky

the passing of bierce

i have triumphed over both life and death because i no longer desire to live nor do i any longer fear to die

but at my back i always hear

time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near

life seemed to him to be a narrow cage and her iron bars were many and dense and there was only one way out

when i die nieces i want to be cremated my ashes taken up in a bush plane and sprinkled onto the people in town below let them think my body is snowflakes sticking in their hair and on their shoulders like dandruff

poets are interested primarily in death and commas

little sleepshead sprouting hair in the moonlight

when i come back

we will go out together

we will walk out together among

the ten thousand things

each scratched too late with such knowledge the wages of dying is love

time erodes us all

knowing you are alive is watching on every side your generations short time falling away as fast as rivers drop through air and feeling it hit

i asked this heroic pet lover how it felt to have died for a schnauzer named teddy salvador biagiani was philosophical he said it sure beat dying for absolutely nothing in the viet nam war

the world begins anew with every birth my father used to say he forgot to say with every death it ends or did not think he needed to because for a goodly part of his life he worked in a graveyard

just for a while deaths opening chatup line in his great seduction before he drugged you with soporific comforts distracted you with minor luxuries and ensnared you with longterm payment plans

join the rat race just for a while

concentrate on your career just for a while

move in with your girlfriend just for a while

find a bigger place out in the burbs just for a while

lie down in that wooden box just for a while

it is my wish to die of unique causes perhaps in a highspeed tricycle crash a bizarre stapling incient or as a result of inadvertently sucking my brains out through my ear while trying to untwist the vacuum hose

if i should go before the rest of you

break not a flower nor inscribe a stone

nor when im gone speak in a sunday voice

but be the usual selves that i have known

weep if you must

but life goes on

so sing as well

people were excited by violence what after all was the sexual act but a voluntarily endured assault a momentary death

the southwind brings

life sunshine and desire

and on every mount and meadow

but over the dead he has no power

the lost the lost he cannot restore

and looking over the hills i mourn

the darling who shall not return

psychologists have clinically observed that overly prolonged grief in the bereaved usually signifies a poor relationship with the one who died

we do not play on graves—

because there isnt room—

besides—it isnt even—it slants

and people come—

and put a flower on it—

and hang their faces so—

were fearing that their hearts will drop—

and crush our pretty play—

and so we move as far

as enemies—away—

just looking round to see how far

it is—occasionally—

a little smoke lost in the air that was the life of a man

while death and darkness girdle me

i could picture how caprice was before we lost her dark hair beautiful smile intelligent hazel eyes quick wit

now gone

just gone

like a chessboard where suddenly one of the knights disappeared a blank spot on the board of life that could never truly be replaced because no two things were alike no two beings alike

i grew up in a hospital and as a child i played in the dissecting room

when graves are covered with stones the dead can no longer get out but the dead can’t go out anyway what difference does it make whether they’re covered with soil or stones

nothing in life was as ugly as death

death was forthe other people

one day we will all wear a garment which has no pockets

death is a scandal the machine is functioning we are all hostages

be gentle

with every soul

you meet

you wake up

there is someone

and secretly

that they

had not

the beauty of the sea is that it never shows any weakness and never tires of the countless souls that unleash their broken voices into its secret depths

maybe death is the great equalizer the one big thing that can finally make strangers shed a tear for one another

eventually however the denial turned into emptiness and my childhood ended

hope could not outlast the breather love however    love was something not even death could conquer because at the end of everything even life he was hers

birth is painful and delightful death is painful and delightful everything that ends is also the beginning of something else pain is not a punishment pleasure is not a reward

if one does die taking these drugs the death is likely to be very peaceful morphia is after all the goddess of dreams

with the dread first kiss was the beginning second kiss was the end

he was just a small church parson when the

war broke out and he

looked and dressed and acted like all parsons

that we see

he wore the clerics broadcloth and he hooked

his vest behind

but he had a mans religion and he had a stong

and he heard the call to duty and he quit his

church and went

and he bravely tramped right with em every

where the boys were sent

he put aside his broadcloth and he put the

said hed come to be a soldier and was going

then hed refereed the prize fights that the boys

pulled off at night

and if no one else was handy hed put on the

gloves and fight

he wasnt there a fortnight ere he saw the sol

and he said im done with preaching this

is now the time for deeds

he learned the sound of shrapnel he could tell

the size of shell

from the shriek it make above him and he knew

just where it fell

in the front line trench he laboured and he knew

the feel of mud

and he didnt run from danger and he wasnt

he wrote letters for the wounded and he cheered

them with his jokes

and he never made a visit without passing round

the smokes

then one day a bullet got him as he knelt be

who was going west right speedy and they

both seemed mighty glad

cause he held the boys hand tighter and he

smiled and whispered low

now you neednt fear the journey over there

with you ill go

and they both passed out together arm in arm

i think they went

he had kept his vow to follow everywhere the

boys were sent

have you ever for even a second thought about how hard it is for people like me just to stay alive

i want to feel the rush of death the high of utter nothingness the fragility of my own mortality let it slip through my fingers like sand and when its gone for good ill be none the wiser

the fury of confession at first

then the fury of clarity

it was from you death that such hypocritical

obscure feeling was born and now

let them accuse me of every passion

let them badmouth me let them say i’m deformed

you isolate me you give me the certainty of life

i’m on the stake i play the card of fire

and i win this little immense goodness of mine

i can do it for i have suffered you too much

i return to you as an émigré returns

to his own country and rediscovers it

i made a fortune in the intellect

and i’m happy as i once was

destitute of any norm

a black rage of poetry in my breast

once your joy was confused with terror

it’s true and now almost with other joy

livid and arid my passion deluded

now you really frighten me

for you are truly close to me

part of my angry state of obscure hunger

of the anxiety almost of a new being

i love you now i love you immortally even if i die and there is nothing left of me

o never from the memory of my heart

your dear paternal image shall depart

who while on earth ere yet by death surprised

taught me how mortals are immortalized

how grateful am i for that patient care

all my life long my language shall declare

how very clean

now as if in belated punishment for the invention of writing any message once posted on the internet was immortal words as numerous as the dust of the earth would linger forever in their millions and trillions and quadrillions and beyond

the fear of death never left me i couldnt get used to the thought i would still sometimes shake and weep with terror by contrast the fact of existence here and now sometimes took on a glorious splendour

downfall failure and death cannot be far from any man who made counterfeit friends his ally and support

after your death you will be what you were before your birth

the bed we loved in was a spinning world

where we would dive for pearls my lover’s words

were shooting stars which fell to earth as kisses

on these lips my body now a softer rhyme

to his now echo assonance his touch

a verb dancing in the centre of a noun

some nights i dreamed he’d written me the bed

a page beneath his writer’s hands romance

and drama played by touch by scent by taste

in the other bed the best our guests dozed on

dribbling their prose my living laughing love

i hold him in the casket of my widow’s head

as he held me upon that next best bed

youre only putting off the inevitable he said

thats what being alive is all about

once the game is over the king and the pawn go back in the same box

if i could take a bite of the whole world

and feel it on my palate

i’d be more happy for a minute or so

but i don’t always want to be happy

sometimes you have to be

unhappy to be natural

not every day is sunny

when there’s been no rain for a while you pray for it to come

so i take unhappiness with happiness

naturally like someone who doesn’t find it strange

that there are mountains and plains

and that there are cliffs and grass

what you need is to be natural and calm

in happiness and in unhappiness

to feel like someone seeing

to think like someone walking

and when it’s time to die remember the day dies

and the sunset is beautiful and the endless night is beautiful

that’s how it is and that’s how it should be

nobody can tell what is right and what is wrong what is righteous and what is evil even if there is a god and i had his teachings right before me i would think it through and decide if that was right or wrong myself

in spite of my suffering at the thought that i was sure to end up by killing myself i cried aloud and burst into tears

i truly believe i am not afraid of death what i shrink from i believe is the shame of dying as stupid and befuddled as i am

nobody wants to believe that existence carries on without at least taking a stumble from their departure of this world

…the longer i think about it the more it seems to me that we who are still alive are unreal in the eyes of the dead that only occasionally in certain lights and atmospheric conditions do we appear in their field of vision

madness doesn’t get off wearing gloves it needs to feel skin on skin smell the blood and shit as it brings itself off

the fact of having been born is a bad augury for immortality

ah earth you old extinguisher

the living used to wonder what happened after death she said that whole religions were born and evolved around this one simple uncertainty

our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them

they looked to each other for support for strength and at times motivation to remember why and for whom they lived

but at my back i always hear

time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near

and yonder all before us lie

giving birth by marcus amaker

do you remember

when the earth was just a baby

settling in its skin

safe in the arms of mother nature

with fire breathing from within

you were not shackled by time

and life roamed around your heart

with the weight of dinosaurs

leaving footprints in your lungs

and the first time you saw the sun

you could barely breathe

because the possibility of endless light

so you admire the strength of trees

who naturally grew into

staring down the mouth of

do you remember being  years old

when your mother told you

birth is more painful than dying

and you burst with dreams

seeking light in your heart

where shadows now rest

comfortably next to fear

but you come out of the woods clear

with nature’s breath

under your tongue

and a weightless bliss

no longer scared of

you smell so good

no i dont i smell like death

youre crazy youre not dead you do not smell like death

i was dead a long time

and now youre not hence the alive smell

not that theres anything wrong with just lying around on your back

in its way rotting is interesting too as we will see

its just that there are other ways to spend your time as a cadaver

one forgets the dead quite quickly one doesnt wonder about the deadwhat is he doing now who is he with

fate is the same for the man who holds back the same if he fights hard

we are all held in a single honour the brave with the weaklings

a man dies still if he has done nothing as one who has done much

a man who takes into consideration the feelings of others even when arranging the manner of his own death shows a nobility of character which compels the admiration of all classes

death was not the scariest thing out there no the denial of it could be far worse

my name isn’t in the list of those

who died or were

there are two kinds of people in this world son those who save lives and those who take lives

and what of those who protect and defend those who save lives by taking lives

thats like trying to stop a storm by blowing harder ridiculous you cant protect by killing

human stories are practically always about one thing really arent they death the inevitability of death

dark circles under my eyes sink deeper and deeper into my skull in contrast to my pale skin there is an undeniable resemblance to a fresh corpse

this is where the evening splits in half henry love or death grab an end pull hard and make a wish

who knows what evil lurks in the heart of men

the death of rats looked up from the feast of the potato squeak he said

death waved a hand dismissively well yes obviously me he said i just wondered if there was anyone else

those who live in memories are never really dead

in the end all you want is someone to long for you when it comes time to put you in the ground

scarlet watched a leaf fall to the ground lying dead amoung the other leaves on the forest floor a brief life seems pointless

tristan thought for a moment isnt that what life is though a brief opportunity to exist a short gift

if christ is god he cannot sin and if suffering was a sin in and by itself he could not have suffered and died for us however since he took the most horrific death to redeem us he showed us in fact that suffering and pain have great power

for brutus as you know was caesars angel

judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him

this was the most unkindest cut of all

the amazing miracle of death when one second youre walking and talking and the next second youre an object

and now let us love and take that which is given us and be happy for in the grave there is no love and no warmth nor any touching of the lips nothing perchance or perchance but bitter memories of what might have been

losing a mate to death is devastating but its not a personal attack like divorce when somebody you love stops loving you and walks away its an insult beyond comparison

someday you will die and until you know that youre useless to me

being alone can be good its easy to find peace alone but sometimes being alone is a king of death

i find myself thinking about my ongoing existence as a human being and the path that lies ahead of me though of course these thoughts lead to but one place  death

she had storms all her life but she died peacefully

i wont be sad too often

if they bury me in the library

with bookworms in my coffin

twas something else i had come to hate her you see i had come to wish her dead and that was what held me back

he danced with the sky instead and the sky dropped him like a rotten plum

die die we all pass away

but dont wear a frown coz its really okay

and you might try to hide and you might try to pray

but we all end up remains of the day

even when our death is imminent we carry the image of ourselves moving forward alive into the future

life is the death of all of us  tristan

if there is nothing else there is this to be inundated consumed

if you truly live you will never truly die

who said all times delight

hath she for narrow bed

lifes troubled bubble broken

thats what i said

i had traded the fight against love for the fight against loneliness the fight against life for the fight against death

the best way to be appreciative for your life is to live it dont die for any other reason but love dreams are what guide us art is what defines us math is makes it all possible and love is what lights our way

oh god god why did you take such trouble to force this creature out of its shell if it is now doomed to crawl back  to be sucked back  into it

too much of water hast thou poor ophelia

and therefore i forbid my tears

the kiss oh the kiss what a perfect unnerving luscious kiss he made me feel unhinged    like he could take me apart and put me back together again and again

flowers cold from the dew

and autumns approaching breath

i pluck for the warm luxuriant braids

which havent faded yet

in their nights fragrantly resinous

entwined with delightful mystery

they will breathe in her springlike

but in a whirlwind of sound and fire

from her shing head they will flutter

and falland before her

they will die faintly fragrant still

and impelled by faithful longing

my obedient gaze will feast upon them

with a reverent hand

love will gather their rotting remains

the longer i lived the longer it would be until i saw him alive again until i could taste his new lips and run my fingers through his new hair we could be young and beautiful again

its harder to pick and choose when youre dead its like a photograph you know it doesnt matter as much

if you heard your lover scream in the next room

and you ran in and saw his pinkie on the floor in a small puddle of blood

you wouldnt rush to the pinkie and say

darling are you ok

no youd wrap your arms around his shoulders

and worry about the pinkie later

the same holds true if you heard the scream

ran in and saw his hand or god forbid his whole arm

but suppose you hear your lover scream in the next room

and you run in and his head is on the floor next to his body

which do you rush to and comfort first

they couldnt keep death out but while she was in she had to act like a lady

you may remember that on earth—though of course we never confessed it—the death of anyone we knew even those we liked best was always mingled with a certain satisfaction at being finally done with them

losing someone you love is harder one minute theyre there the next theyre gone there were times i wished they would rise up from the dead

everything even me and one day even charlotte must come to end

was there any meaning to life or to war that two men should sit together and jump within seconds of each other and yet never meet on the ground below

would you guys choose to walk away from possibly the most incredible encounter of your lifetime just because you had to let it go sooner then you wanted just because you knew that it would never be

i know who you are and i am ready not that i want to go of course but i will come those souls are always light because more of them have been put out

the grave and the image are equally links with the irrecoverable and symbols for the unimaginable

my father will find you and kill you for what you have done she said to him solemnly

maligo towered over her a leering smile twisting his dark face

you would have to consider yourself lucky if you ever see your father again even if it is while he watches me take your life he snarled allowing a haughty smirk creep across his face

people arent often asked to make life or death decisions there are no causes to die for you can go through life never knowing which of your friends would really come through for you

i doubt love can do little else if it cannot bring back people back from the dead

walking thru this graveyard i realize times were never really hard we live we love we let it go the world aint changed me at all

but in battle you cannot tell another when it is his time to enter the worldtocome nor is it possible to keep any man in this world when he wishes to leave it behind

all death reminds us that nothing is promised only that life was worth it

to his way of thinking the only thing more natural than death was sex

death is a bored clerk with too many orders to fill there is no reckoning no profound moment it creeps up on us from behind and snatches us away while we shit

suicidal glory is the luxury of the irresponsible

diamonds were nothing more than carbon but carbon in a crystal lattice that made it the hardest known mineral in nature that was the way we all were headed i was sure of it we were destined to be diamonds

anna ash i dont have anything planned with my mother shes dead

ashley what

anna she died when i was seven she drowned its just my dad and me i didnt tell you before because i just wanted a fresh start here because before i moved everybody knew about it and im sorry

ashley  youre like a disney princess

the guillotine is the ultimate expression of law and its name is vengeance it is not neutral nor does it allow us to remain neutral

i know what you mean i said

his eyes opened wider for a second he seemed to see me no you don’t he said you mustn’t he keeps wanting to give you his love a gift out and out and you dismiss it shrug it off because you’re afraid

i’m not afraid it’s more like… i watched myself in the mirror above the sink the mask was suddenly a gag i listened

i’ll give you what i learned from all this he said accept what people offer drink their milkshakes take their love

but all these transformations exist as constructs of the mindthe actual energy present in the sunbeam experiences no change at all

it’s natural to die the fact that we make such a big hullabaloo over it is all because we don’t see ourselves as part of nature we think because we’re human we’re something above nature

but a rocket has suddenly struck a terrific blast quite close beyond the village the entire fabric of the air the time is changed—the casement window blown inward rebounding with a wood squeak to slam again as all the house still shudders

their hearts pound eardrums brushed taut by the overpressure ring in pain the invisible train rushes away close over the rooftop

they sit still as the painted dogs now silent oddly unable to touch death has come in the pantry door stands watching them iron and patient with a look that says try to tickle me

ever peaceful be you slumber

though your days were few in number

on this earthspite took its toll

yet shall heaven have your soul

with pure love we did regard you

for your loved one did we guard you

but you came not to the groom

only to a chill dark tomb

you cannot be buried in obscurity you are exposed upon a grand theater to the view of the world if your actions are upright and benevolent be assured they will augment your power and happiness

death is alive they whispered death lives inside life as bones dance within the body yesterday is within today yesterday never dies

you have tasted of death now said the old man is it good

it is good said mossy it is better than life

no said the old man it is only more life

if i lie down on my bed i must be here

but if i lie down in my grave i may be elsewhere

and this evening when i close my eyes against the darkness and think about her ill imagine iridescent wings fluttering if only for a moment against cloudless blue skies

death will be a great relief no more interviews

what is birthday but a celebration of death

the scribbled signature black onto the blinding global white onto the thick soupy red

yet for quixotic reasonsnamely that i enjoyed writing obitsi had decided to scale back on articles about city life in order to write exclusively about the citys dead for even less money it was a strange and inexplicable career move

how could a person have and do all these stupid thingsclip coupons and double lock the front doorand then one day just cease to exist

love is not love that wounded bleeds and bleeding sullies slow come death within my hands and i unto my love will go

im not afraid of being dead im just afraid of what you might have to go through to get there

but death was sweet death was gentle death was kind death healed the bruised spirit and the broken heart and gave them rest and forgetfulness death was man’s best friend when man could endure life no longer death came and set him free

lifes only choosing when to die lifes a big postponement because the choice is so difficult its a tremendous relief not to have to choose

all creation necessarily ends in this creators powerless fleeing from the things they have wrought

suicides heart attacks the papers didnt seem interested the world was full of ways to die too many to cover newsworthy deaths had to be exceptional most people go unobserved

artmaking is not about telling the truth but making the truth felt

believe it or not each and every one of us in this room is one day going to stop breathing turn cold and die

a complete life may be one ending in so full identification with the nonself that there is no self to die

what branch does not have its leaves and which twig will not have its flowers

the only advantage of knowledge is that it can justify suffering

because beauty consits of its own passing just as we reach for it its the ephemeral configuration of things in the moment when you can see both their movement and their death

never trust a man who teaches about death

but yet had no real experience at all about it

come my child i said trying to lead her away wish goodbye to the poor hare and come and look for blackberries

oh my darling my darling she moaned over and over again and god meant your life to be so beautiful

the dead person is not truly dead until the last person who rememebers them dies

how am i going to tell the kids how do i tell the man that i love the man that i swore i’d grow old with that we won’t have that happy ending that he and i have worked so hard for how do i say goodbye to all of you how do i let go

to learn to die is to learn to live death is the giver of life

who can be worried without the light of a memory

death is never an excuse to stop living

we are born and then we die and in between lies only this strange darkness that we can’t break

gone but only until we get there

you why are you so afraid of war and slaughter even if all the rest of us drop and die around you grappling for the ships you’d run no risk of death you lack the heart to last it out in combat—coward

literature is the ditch im going to die in its still the thing i care most about

ill fall

you wont fall

ill fall ill fall and ill die

as i said it i could see it happening the foot stepping on air pulling the rest of my body with it tree limbs breaking as i plummeted down

no he said his voice assured youd never do that to me

i say the same thing about the death of james wait oh well  he wasnt going to write the beethovens ninth symphony anyway

the only cure for a real hangover is death

death is more merciful than hope itself there is nothing surprising in this for death is divinely appointed while hope is the creation of human folly both end in frustration am i destined to lead a life of endless frustration

the beginning and the end

we’re organisms we’re conceived we’re born we live we die and we decay but as we decay we feed the world of the living plants and bugs and bacteria

let him submit to me only the god of death is so relentless death submits to no one—so mortals hate him most of all the gods let him bow down to me i am the greater king i am the elderborn i claim—the greater man

and yet said poirot suppose an accident

ah no my friend

from your point of view it would be regrettable i agree but nevertheless let us just for one moment suppose it then perhaps all these here are linked together  by death

i was dancing when i was twelve

i was dancing when i was aaah

i danced myself right out the womb

is it strange to dance so soon

i danced myself right out the womb

i was dancing when i was eight

is it strange to dance so late

i danced myself into the tomb

is it strange to dance so soon

i danced myself into the tomb

is it wrong to understand

the fear that dwells inside a man

whats it like to be a loon

i liken it to a balloon

i danced myself out of the womb

is it strange to dance to soon

i danced myself into the tomb

but then again once more

i danced myself out of the womb

is it strange to dance so soon

i danced myself out of the womb

as soon as someone dies frenzied construction of the future shifting furniture etc futuromania

whilst the wolflets bayed

a grave was made

and then with the strokes of a silver spade

it was filled to make a mound

and for two cold days and three long nights

the father tended that holy plot

and stayed by where his wife was laid in the grave within the ground

for two days i went about my business i travelled the globe as always handing souls to the conveyor belt of eternity

one wants to live of course indeed one only stays alive by virtue of the fear of death but i think as i thought then that it is better to die violently and not too old

lieb liebchen leg ‘s händchen aufs herze mein

so sweeting why were you threatening to throw tate out of the house what did he say

leather brushed her chin as he tipped it up serious dark eyes met hers what did he say

she glanced around surely the footmen were too far away to hear he wanted to join us in our bed

i’ll run him through

no perhaps he only said it to goad you into a duel perhaps it was intended as a way to kill you

it was an insult to you love that can’t be ignored

and so you rush inexorably toward death i don’t care if he stands on a drury lane stage and calls me a courtesan i won’t have you risking your life

dr beall gave him the first shot followed closely by the second

he said ill check for a heartbeat

i said you dont need to i can see it in his eyes

that kind of imagination is why were not dead

wherever you look there is so much loss and folly to contemplate

does anyone else day dream about what it would be like if specific age groups just dropped dead all across the world

time and death its the ultimate vision of an artist at the end of everything its just whats there it was not something i planned to do

that implacable lover who was going to turn billys eyes away from me forever

after i am dead id rather have people ask why i have no monument than why i have one

any time

and will a not come again

and will a not come again

no no he is dead

go to thy death bed

he will never come again

each day death corrodes what we call living and life ceaselessly swallows our desire for the void

glory is the sunshine of the dead

till her appointed course be run

till on the darkness faint her breath

flown to the silent void and death

the testimony of the suns

they hadfinished their lives before their death – which is not always the end of life and often comes long before the end

happiness is the change that comes over me

when i describe the world

it comes over the world

happiness is the change that comes over me

when im afraid

it comes over the world

for instance i can be afraid of and for the world

afraid because the world consists among other things

of me so swiftly dying

everybody was dying or already dead or leaving other people and the year was dying into winter and the only thing to do was make some noise

in ten years time i’ll be… dead sixty

as he watches the sun rise what grieves him is that he failed her he thinks of the terror she felt they tell him it was quick as if that will somehow confine the horror

the man now retrieved a linen cloth and stuffed it deep into katherine’s mouth death he

whispered to her should be a quiet thing

all primitive people are frightened of owls said harley the villagers here are scared to death of the gufo birds of ill omen if they see one they think theyll die but they never do see one i mean of course he added with a laugh

erik erik i saved your life remember you were scentenced to death but for me you would be dead by now

death always knew how to connect vice with misfortune

life isnt fair its just fairer than death thats all

the desire of death will not always lead you to death but the fear of death will

why is edamame always ready to expire it´s so urgent for a vegetable edamame it sounds like an assisted form of suicide is there an advertising concept in this

some of us hover when we weep for the other who was

dying since the day they were born

we must make haste then not only because we are daily nearer to death but also because the conception of things and the understanding of them cease first

dying speech of an old philosopher

i strove with none for none was worth my strife

nature i loved and next to nature art

i warmd both hands before the fire of life

it sinks and i am ready to depart

yes he is here in this

the few young trees set out

to modify the bare facts

hes here but only

because we are here

when we go he goes with us

to be your hands that never

do violence your eyes

that wonder your lives

that daily praise life

by living it by laughter

he is never alone here

never cold in the field of graves

it is when we are faced with death that we turn most bookish

with the gods gone and christ not yet come there was a unique moment from cicero to marcus aurelius when man stood alone nowhere else do i find that particular grandeur

…not that it was unjust not that the scales were forced out of balance where there had been good it showed as clearly kindnesses accomplishments all those were present too

you had once asked me if i was afraid of death

i said i was afraid of not living

i don’t want to eke out my life like a resource in short supply the only selfish life is a timid one to hold back to withdraw to keep the best in reserve both overvalues the self and undervalues what the self is

a dead dog is more quiet than a house on the steppes a chair in a empty room

corpses sour you they are bad for objectivity

the angel of death is the invisible angel of life

i believe there are ways whose ends are life instead of death

death frees us from the sickness of modern life

she would die and maybe everyone would forget that she had ever lived

a heart can be broken but it keep on beating just the same

the language of roses shifts under our feet it blows in and out like the wind it carries the fragrance of the flower and then it is goneit is how we learn to speak about something that is disappearing as we say its name

let whoever can win glory before death

you never know these days uninvited guests may force you to take an unplanned trip to an unknown destination doesn’t hurt to be in your sunday clothes

it’s when i have to acknowledge the past and all of those nameless faceless people i’d assassinated that i unravel inside

remember me when i am dead

and simplify me when im dead

the sum of his life was a unique melody hauntingly beautiful and powerful

open questions like love life death struggle and sex are our experiences our opinions are not answers but they still remain mysterious unanswered questions let it be open

an honorable death is well and good but if the life at stake is not your own what then

sometimes you cant save someone from themselves

awareness of mortality exerts a unique power to focus the mind and heart on essentials

men may perish but the world will neither celebrate nor mourn it will go on his smile thinned would you like to know how

no

stop it lan whispered through numb lips

i wonder if my first breath was as soulstirring to my mother as her last breath was to me

it was mina this whole time wasn’t it

i give him the only thing i can the cold hard truth the one that’ll rewrite every memory he has  of him and me her and me the two of them all three of us it’ll always be mina

we are all dust passing through the air the difference is some are flying high in the sky while others are flying low but eventually we all settle on the same ground

i believe that to be the worlds greatest living

there must be something

terribly wrong with you

i dont even want to be the worlds greatest

just being dead would be fair

what are you doing to me he asked the crow tearful teaching you how to fly i can’t fly you’re flying right now i’m falling every flight begins with a fall the crow said

you can’t avoid the inevitability of death it comes at you one way or another and takes us all to the same place in the end to apologize for it is to apologize for the sun shining or the rain falling it is what it is

ah lalage while life is ours

hoard not thy beauty rose and white

but pluck the pretty fleeing flowers

that deck our little path of light

for all too soon we twain shall tread

the bitter pastures of the dead

estranged sad spectres of the night

life is the only thing which can never be replaced when lost

death starves us of life so we learn to fabricate our own immortalities

they had killed him  murdered him except he would not die would not die he vowed because he would live to kill his killers

the battle with the gods thus hinges on our own mortality creativity is a yearning for immortality

we are all of life

who stepped from the sea

trading weightless journeys of the currents

we are all of life

who build and tear down and build again

to find gold and silver

to find scars that weep and bleed

to step from the sea

to stay with the sea

im one of those who doesnt think there is much difference

between an atomic scientist and a man who cleans the crappers

except for the luck of the draw

parents with enough money to point you toward a more

of course some come through brilliantly but

there are thousands millions of others bottled up kept

from even the most minute chance to realize their potential

jails are a spooky place remarked bill trying to match the pace of detective adam

oh that is nothing in front of the ultimate fear replied detective adam

funny thing that the ultimate fear is also the ultimate relief

which is

when you have the power to love that strength that courage is infinite that love is infinite there is nothing finite about its presence for love never dies

i see no end to my misery but the grave

but me

they cannot touch

old age and death the strange

and ignominious end of old

if they succeed it will not matter if man becomes immortal

he will have nothing to live for

a tired man lay down his head

in a dusty room so dim

and for so long his wife did shake

and yell to waken him

meanwhile his thoughts his dreams did stir

of powderblasts in the air

and carnival delights

yet still his wife was in despair

in a dusty room so dim

for she knew death was a whore

not far from tempting him

the stronger civilization becomes the more deeply the love of death is buried in the subconscious

for what blessing may a man hope for but

an immortality in

the loving vigilance of death

its as if i had been going downhill when i thought i was going uphill thats how it was in societys opinion i was heading uphill but in equal measure life was slipping away from me and now its all over nothing left but to die

the gods play no

not only are selves conditional but they die each day we wake slightly altered and the person we were yesterday is dead so why one could say be afraid of death when death comes all the time

he took his hands off the oars and pulled in the mooring rope if i make a couple of loops he thought i can strap the axe on to my back

he had a mental picture of what could happen to a man who plunged into the cauldron below a waterfall with a sharp piece of metal attached to his body

vimes blinked a tall dark robed figure was now sitting in the boat

are you death

its the scythe isnt it people always notice the scythe

im going to die

possibly you turn up when people are possibly going to die

oh yes its quite the new thing its because of the uncertainty principle

whats that

im not sure

thats very helpful

when your people are lying dead around you dont come crying to me

and i dont believe you dead how can you be dead if i still feel you maybe like god you changed into something different that ill have to speak to in a different way but you not dead to me nettie and never will you be

you can’t get the blood out

most of us are naturally inclined to struggle against the restrictions our friends and family impose upon us but if we are so unfortunate as to lose a loved one what a difference then then the restriction becomes a sacred trust

the blue glow was bottmless it seemed to be sucking her own thoughts out of her mind

no whispered susan no ive never thought like that

death stood up abruptly and turned away you may find out that it helps he said

these are the ushers of martius before him

he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears

death that dark spirit ins nervy arm doth lie

which being advancd declines and then men die

art is long and time is fleeting

and our hearts though stout and brave

still like muffled drums are beating

funeral marches to the grave

the menopause of sarah became her menostart this is feminine beauty the death plot against mordecai became his life spring this is masculine beauty a kind of life lived in gods word is a life of miraculous beauty

neighbours complaining about someone’s dog making an awful racket you could hardly blame the poor beast its owner had died in her bed at least a fortnight before and there hadn’t been much left of the old girl worth eating

there are worse ways to die than warm and drunk

he should be happy because he can think about the unhappiness of others

he’s stupid if he doesn’t know other people’s unhappiness is theirs

and isn’t cured from the outside

because suffering isn’t like running out of ink

or a trunk not having iron bands

there being injustice is like there being death

are not our lives too short for that full utterance which through all our stammerings is of course our only and abiding intention

death had been more pitiful to them than longer life would have been it had taken the one in the loyalty of love and the other in the innocence of faith from a world which for love has no recompense and for faith no fulfillment

marvin paused for a rest

after a few moments they resumed and let him see the o the g the i the z and the e

the next two words were for and the the last one was a long one and marvin needed another rest before the could tackle it

it started with i then n then c next came an o and an n followed by a v an e another n and an i

after a final pause marvin gathered his strength for the last stretch

he read the e the n the c and at last the final e and staggered back into their arms

i think he murmured at last from deep within his corroding rattling thorax i feel good about it

the lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever

in crime and enmity they lie

who sin and tell us love can die

who say to us in slanders breath

that love belongs to sin and death

all are dead and ourselves left alone amidst a new generation whom we know not and who know us not

she did not have time to wonder about his being late he died bent over the sidewalk sign that stood out in front of the hardware store he had not even had time to get into the store

for as much as i hate the cemetery i’ve been grateful it’s here too i miss my wife it’s easier to miss her at a cemetery where she’s never been anything but dead than to miss her in all the places where she was alive

once a thing is set to happen all you can do is hope it wont or willdepending as long as you live there’s always something waiting and even if it’s bad and you know its bad what can you do you can’t stop living

the first time i died i didnt see god no light at the end of the tunnel no haloed angels no dead grandparents to be fair i probably wasnt a solid shooin for heaven but honestly i kind of assumed id make the cut

please bury me in the library

with a dozen longstemmed proses

the summer is gone and never can it return there will never be any summer any more and i am weary of everything… i am alone

no thought is born in me that does not bear the image of death

of all the many people we meet in a lifetimeit is strange that so many of us find ourselves in thrall to one

particular person once that face is seenan involuntary heartache sets in for which there is no cure all the

wonder of this world finds shape in that one person and thereafter there is no reprieve because this kind of love

does not endor not until death

but try to remember that a good man can never die you will see your brother many times againin the streets at home in all the places of the town the person of a man may go but the best part of him stays it stays forever

her mouth set ive already lost one man i loved tonight i will not lose the other she glared at him and curse you you stone head for making me say it first

every living thing requires love to survive for without it we die

an enemy is like a mans most prized flower it brings him joy to see it buried in the ground

this worlds a city full of straying streets and deaths the marketplace where each one meets

oh dire dreadful death you drag your heels

why dawdle and draw back you drown my heart

if seeing her an hour before her last

weak cough into all blackness i could yet

be held by chalkwhite walls

the consumptive belsen

one of my biggest fears is that im going to die alone in my home and my cats will eat me because i am too dead to open their food cans

just consider how terrible the day of your death will be

others will go on speaking and you will not be able to argue back

it seems like with you everything leads back to the subject of death

not success not growth not happiness the cradle of your love of life … is death

and it was not alone

i had never known any man to die while speaking in terzarima

life is short enough there is nothing worth here to take your life and those things we do gain can never be taken to our grave

you are immortal till the very moment you die discover it and stand untouchable

what you dont think about when youre planning for children is when youre going to teach them how not to be killed

death is a continuation of my life without me

i carry the seeds of death within me and plant them wherever i linger long enough to love

he paused then claimed that chapman had whipered in his ear while he was writing the speech

only in death will we have our own names since only in death are we no longer part of the effort in death we become heroes

i didnt want to die i just found death soothing to think about

from a purely physical standpoint she didnt have a chance but her attitude was that death was better than capitulation

no amount of wishing will bring back the dead

once someone asked me what do you want to be your epitaph so i said paulo coelho died when he was alive

indeed hearty laughter streamed through my nose could he do it perpetually i asked

perpetually my neighbor rubbed his waxy chin

i mean is he still able to do it

i’m not sure i understand

well then is he dead…

my neighbors puzzled face slowly began to transform into a look of realization but sir he said of course he’s dead i mean to say this man could kill himself on command you see and you don’t come back from the dead

the two of us found ourselves crossing to the door so i could let my visitor out i slapped him with friendliness on the shoulder

no you don’t come back from the dead i agreed

it was like a dream you might have after death in which lost people came back to life your friends loved you again no matter what you had done and your failures were unaccountably forgiven

the country people indeed did not always clearly distinguish between the fairies and the dead they called them both the silent people and the milky way they thought was the path along which the dead were carried to fairyland

death is not in the nature of things it is the nature of things but what dies is the form the matter is immortal

a penny for my thoughts oh no ill sell em for a dollar their worth so much more after im a goner and then maybe youll hear the words ive been singing funny when your dead how people start listening

if i werent already dead id have to kill myself just so i could roll over in my grave

and in this moment i realize one reason its so great to have a best friend is sometimes like right now cal and i are thinking the very same thing

sit chloe said dashing after him and tugging firmly at his sleeve lets hear the rest of it you can kill him later

chloe to dageus

believe in me and you shall die forever

im going to enjoy this

what i asked hell

for some death is an art for others it is merely an inevitability

seek for the endless life in the world because with death there remains neither the seeker nor the sought the other world is altogether an illusion stop deceiving yourself seek for the endless life in the world

death it was something i had to think about once weird right strange that death was ever an inevitable end but it wasn’t anymore not really i eluded it tricked it it was an odd concept—the world aged moved forward yet i    didn’t

the planets tyrant dotard death had held his gray mirror before them for a moment and shown them the image of things to come

how wicked it would be if we could to call the dead back she said not to me but to the chaplain i am at peace with god she smiled but not at me poi si torno all eterna fontana

thy soul shall find itself alone

’mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone—

not one of all the crowd to pry

into thine hour of secrecy

be silent in that solitude

which is not loneliness—for then

the spirits of the dead who stood

in life before thee are again

in death around thee—and their will

shall overshadow thee be still

the dead leave their shadows an echo of the space within which once they lived they haunt us never fading or growing older as we do the loss we grieve is not just their futures but our own

the trifler

deaths the lover that id be taking

wild and fickle and fierce is he

smalls his care if my heart be breaking

gay young death would have none of me

hear them clack of my haste to greet him

no one other my mouth had kissed

i had dressed me in silk to meet him

false young death would not hold the tryst

slows the blood that was quick and stormy

smooth and cold is the bridal bed

i must wait till he whistles for me

proud young death would not turn his head

i must wait till my breast is wilted

i must wait till my back is bowed

i must rock in the corner jilted

death went galloping down the road

gones my heart with a trifling rover

fine he was in the game he played

kissed and promised and threw me over

and rode away with a prettier maid

enough were tired my heart and i

we sit beside the headstone thus

and wish that name were carved for us

the moss reprints more tenderly

the hard types of the masons knife

as heavens sweet life renews earths life

with which were tired my heart and i

in this abundant earth no doubt

is little room for things worn out

disdain them break them throw them by

and if before the days grew rough

we once were loved used  well enough

i think weve fared my heart and i

i learned a little of beauty  enough to know that it had nothing to do with truth  and i found moreover that there was no great literary tradition there was only the tradition of the eventful death of every literary tradition

the everlasting staircase

when the call came saying twentyfour hours to live

my first thought was cant she postpone her exit

from this planet for a week ive got places to do

people to be then grief hit between the ribs

said disappear or reappear more fully so i boarded

a red eyeball and shot across america

hoping the nurses had enough quarters to keep

the jukebox of grandmas heart playing she grew up

poor in appalachia and while world war ii

functioned like prozac for the great depression

she believed poverty was a double feature

that the comfort of her adult years was merely

an intermission that hunger would hobble back

hurl its prosthetic leg through her window

so she clipped clipped clipped  became the jacques

cousteau of the bargain bin her wetsuit

stuffed with coupons and now pupils fixed chin

dangling like the boots of a hanged man

i press my ear to her lampshadethin chest

and listen to that little soldier march toward whatever

plateau or simply exhaust his arsenal of beats

i hate when people ask if she even knew i was there

the point is i knew holding the onesided

conversation of her hand once i believed the heart

was like a bar of soap  the more you use it

the smaller it gets care too much and itll snap off

in your grasp but when grandmas last breath

waltzed from that room my heart opened

wide like a parachute and i realized she didnt die

she simply found a silence she could call her own

the shortest distance between two points is a time line a schedule a map of your time the itinerary for the rest of your life

nothing shows you the straight line from here to death like a list

its not what id want for at my funeral when i die i just want them to plant me somewhere warm and then when the pretty women walk over my grave i would grab their ankles like in that movie

the back door of every tomb opens on a hilltop

let my heiress have full rights

live in my house sing songs that i composed

yet how slowly my strength ebbs

how the tortured breast craves air

the love of my friends my enemies rancor

and the yellow roses in my bushy garden

and a lovers burning tendernessall this

i bestow upon you messenger of dawn

also the glory for which i was born

for which my star like some whirlwind soared

and now falls look its falling

prophesies your power love and inspiration

preserving my generous bequest

you will live long and worthily

thus it will be you see i am content

be happy but remember me

cure the symptoms cure the disease

visible objects therefore do not perish utterly since nature repairs one thing from another and allows nothing to be born without the aid of anothers death

and when lifes sweet fable ends

soul and body part like friends

no quarrels murmurs no delay

a kiss a sigh and so away

his name was theo

you hang on to your pain like it means something like its worth something well let me tell you its not worth shit so let it go infinite possibilities and all you can do is whine

well what am i supposed to do

what do you think you can do anything you lucky bastard youre alive

we all must face death and walk with it but we also must love and live in it

as she cried i could feel growing there as had once before a presence between us the tiny perfect form of sherry nestled between her parents bodies our bodies were shaped by her absence by the almost unbearable weight of her loss

i am afraid of death you are young so presumably youre more afraid of it than i am obviously we shall put if off as long as we can but it makes very little difference so long as human beings stay human death and life are the same thing

there was a saying in our family that no one ever died people just dried up were hung on a hook and conducted their affairs from there

when death speaks to me it speaks only of the beauty of life

the bodys ills are the least of ills for they end only in death which is but a little thing but if the spirit dies then all is lost

how did it die he asked

short circuit i said old and frayed wires

he looked at me like i was senile

could have been disease violence or sometimes things die because we dont love them enough

without death life would have no boundaries and our days would not be so precious my mother was a firm believer in the common sense of nature

when i shut my eyes on this world ill finally have peace

the crickets still sing in october and lilly shes trying to bloom tho shes resting her head on the shoulder of death she still shines by the light of the moon

death is my lover and he wants to move in

to suspect your own mortality is to know the beginning of terror to learn irrefutably that you are mortal is to know the end of terror

a right understanding that death is nothing

to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable not because it adds to it

an infinite span of time but because it takes away the craving for

immortality for there is nothing terrible in life for the man who has

truly comprehended that there is nothing terrible in not living

with that i took a deep breath and leapt spreading my arms pretending i could fly

actually this is a poem my father once showed me a long time ago it has been bastardized many times in many ways but this is the original

the cold within

in bleak and bitter cold

each possessed a stick of wood

or so the storys told

their dying fire in need of logs

the first man held his back

for of the faces round the fire

he noticed one was black

saw one not of his church

and could not bring himself to give

the fire his stick of birch

the third one sat in tattered clothes

he gave his coat a hitch

why should his log be put to use

to warm the idle rich

the rich man just sat back and thought

of the wealth he had in store

and how to keep what he had earned

from the lazy shiftless poor

the black mans face bespoke revenge

as the fire passed from his sight

for all he saw in his stick of wood

was a chance to spite the white

and the last man of this forlorn group

did naught except for gain

giving only to those who gave

was how he played the game

the logs held tight in deaths still

they didnt die from the cold without

they died from the cold within

when i die i plan to be laughing hysterically

when i die i hope it may be said

her suffering was black but her books were read

i never saw death before and now i see

that it is warring eyes in a womans form

i am going to die but that is of no importance

masks camouflage the faces of both good and evil

keeps hidden what is a truth and what is a lie

the ocean pulsed outside our window the sound of the waves crashing on the rocks below usually calmed me down but the fear and chaos that were tangled in my mind made that an impossibility

if it had been a heart attack the newspaper

might have used the word massive

as if a mountain range had opened

inside her but instead

it used the word suddenly a light coming on

in an empty room the telephone

fell from my shoulder a black parrot repeating

a sunday dusky if it had been

terminal we could have cradled her

as she grew smaller wiped her mouth

said goodbye but it was sudden

how overnight we could be orphaned

the world became a bell wed crawl inside

the ringing all wed eat

he couldn’t look back at the children he couldn’t think of it all he could do was watch the eyes of his wife

and even as the rustling began he felt still he felt calm scratching and scrapping within the stones and the rustle of wings but all eli knew was the nature of love

she nailed it to the wall with her wellaimed dart like a butterfly with no will whose sentence has always been written

i dont know much more than i did when i was alive most of the stuff i know now that i didnt know then i cant put into words

so youre here by yourself

seems like an odd place to come by yourself

i needed to get away

woman trouble thats another of my fathers expressions

no actually i poisoned my neighbors dogs

after a moment she said how drunk are you

is that true

what

that you poisoned your neighbor’s dogs

i’m afraid it is

well keep them away from me

fidelity is a living breathing entity on wobbly footing it can wander becoming something different entirely

what i took away from witnessing the broken climbers in moshi was this everything is easy until it isnt

whatever is destroyed the act of destruction does not vary much beauty if vapour from the pit of death

the ferocity of santiago nasars fate which had collected twenty years of happiness from him not only with his death but also with the dismemberment of his body and its dispersion and extermination

its your life not your death that defines you

among his own people death was a swift insect gleaming black its wings a blur  too fast to be outrun and too agile to be avoided the unplumbed void in which he swam was but the depth of a single facet of its darkly jewelled eyes

there was no safety there was no pride all there was was money everything became money and money became everything money treated us as if we were things and we died

to be good

to save nothing

molecules dissolve and pass away but consciousness survives the death of the matter on which it rides

if we knew what we are we should do as sir arthur jermyn did and arthur jermyn soaked himself in oil and set first to his clothing one night

whats it like

death its like being on holiday with a group of germans

its life you deal with it or you dont

that was a tragedy more terrible than becoming a vampire

of course what im about to share isnt true for me but

friends somebody said are gods apology for relations p

its like romeo  juliet i say you cant separate them otherwise there would be no shakespeare

i decide to be more straightforward i tell him nothing frightens me anymore i am not even afraid to die

busseys eyes already wide open grow even wider my death is the last thing he needs

do you think youll find danny this way bussey asks

finally i answer bussey no i dont think so

bussey seems relieved but im more panicky because i had never thought that i could wind up alone in my mind whatever the odds danny  i were  would be together forever

as i remember his laugh there was nothing mad about it it was more like the laugh of someone who has been the victim of a practical joke a farce in which he had believed until suddenly he realized his folly

a fool without fear is sometimes wiser than an angel with fear

casy said solemnly this here ol man jus lived a life an just died out of it i dont know whether he was good or bad but that dont matter much he was alive an thats what matters an now his dead an that dont matter

if you are distant and misanthropic selfish or cruel you will find yourself alone in life and death

one is seldom unchanged by the death of those one loves it gives me a deeper knowledge of them and so of oneself in regard to them

every soldier in the course of time exists only in the breath of written word

indeed she often wondered if she were dead or dying from the inside out and that was the root of her calm the reason she could surrender her character

our lives carry us along in ways we cannot control and almost nothing stays with us it dies when we do and death is something that happens to us every day

hed learned something life was boobytrapped and there was no easy passage through you had to jump from colour to colour from happiness to happiness and all those possible explosions in between it could be all over any time

we are mortals all human and nonhuman bound in one fellowship of love and travail no one escapes the fate of death but we can with caring make our goodbyes less tormented if we broaden the circle of our compassion life can be less cruel

if some persons died and others did not die death would indeed be a terrible affliction

could she smell my breath could she hear my cursed circular heart beat revolving like the crime it is in my deathly chest

the chanting went on the musicians giving in to the rhythm of their own being finding healing in touching that rhythm and healing in chanting about death the only real god they knew

every story is a story about death but perhaps if we are lucky our story about death is also a story about love

funerals arent scheduled

they are stupid they are beasts they are meat they are death i am talking simply but without any affectation

what kind of lifehave you lived little one that everything seems to be a question of fair and unfair life and death just are fair has nothing to do with it

it came to mary now that her mother had been right after all mary had been born for this in sixteen years shed shot along the shortest route she could find between life and death as the crow flew

i believe that there is something connecting us  something that was here before we got here and will still be here after were gone ive begun to believe that all of our consciousnesses are bound up in that greater consciousness

an animating presence  pp

taggle looked up at her his amber eyes as deep as the loneliness kate had felt before he became her friend

the traditional thing he said slowly involves the river and a sack

he brooded on how close destruction always was to all creatures animals as well as humans and he realized that there is nothing we can predict or know for certain in this world except death

death follows us around for a reason its because death is our best adviser there is nothing more powerful than a person who is prepared to live right now in this instant fully accepting that this may be their last moment on earth

war was so many things and not the least of which confusion what was wrong what was right for that matter

was killing right or wrong brave or cowardly human nature or unnatural behavior of creatures too smart for their own good

loyalty betrayal hate love fear friendship teamwork violence war was connected to all of these hard work sadness suffering discipline chaos questions few answers strategy bravery foolishness death life

and both winning and losing were only two small aspects of the word war

the thing about oracles is that they talk back

we tend to get a little information before we off people it’s not a play by ear sort of deal

it was a year ago today your daughter went missing’ bagg had closed his eyes feeling the death going on inside

and as we watched the tsar of death lifted up his eyelids like skirts and began to dance in the streets of leningrad

you that in faroff countries of the sky can dwell secure look back upon me here for i am weary of this frail worlds decay

a man of importance had been shot at a place i could not pronounce in swahili or in english and because of this shooting whole countries were at war it seemed a laborious method of retribution but that was the way it was being done

the young man tied his shuka on his shoulder one day and took his shield and his spear and went to war he thought war was made of spears and shields and courage and he brought them all

but they gave him a gun so he left the spear and the shield behind him and took the courage and went where they sent him because they said this was his duty and he believed in duty

he took the gun and held it the way they had told him to hold it and walked where they told him to walk smiling a little and looking for another man to fight

he was shot and killed by the other man who also believed in duty and he was buried where he fell it was so simple and so unimportant

but of course it meant something to kibii and me because the tall young man was kibiis father and my most special friend arab maina died on the field of action in the service of the king but some said it was because he had forsaken his spear

there is a pain – so utter –

it swallows substance up –

then covers the abyss with trance –

so memory can step

around – across – opon it –

as one within a swoon –

goes safely – where an open eye –

would drop him – bone by bone

the women in your family have never lost touch with one another death is a path we take to meet on the other side

every human being is doomed to die which is the greatest of all failures

i shall soon be quite dead at last in spite of all

western funerals black hearses and black horses and fastfading flowers why should black be the colour of death why not the colours of a sunset

i wanted to play with death like a child with a new toy i wanted to push all the buttons and see what would happen

then hope unlookedfor came so suddenly to eomers heart and with it the bite of care and fear renewed that he said no more but turned and went swiftly from the hall

i would have had to kill him and death you know keeps secrets better even than a guilty roman

search for the stranger inside you forgotten even by your death

loneliness is the standard that separates life from death

does anybody know which are the thoughts of god even if they are plants mountains sky stars or whatever else

i need to ask are you afraid of spiders

nicholas blinked suddenly caught off guard yes im afraid of spiders

were you always

what are you a psychiatrist

pritam took a breath he could feel laines eyes on him appraising his line of questioning

nicholas looked at laine she watched back her gray eyes missed nothing

sure agreed nicholas standing and my sisters nuts too and we both like imagining that little white dogs are big nasty spiders because our daddy died and we never got enough cuddles

your father died asked laine when

who cares

pritam sighed you must see this from our point of

thats what you believe pritam said carefully

thats what i fucking believe nicholas stabbed his finger through the air at the dead bird talisman lying slack on the coffee table

all things that we ordained festival

turn from their office to black funeral

our instruments to melancholy bells

our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast

our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change

our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse

and all things change them to the contrary

it was  calling me if you can believe it them calling me

emptiness is this world’s greatest discovery who has chosen this kind world for us and why

the belief in death leads meditating about life meanwhile the belief in life leads you thinking about death

don’t hope you will receive help from the words of life because they all bring you to death

dyings a fearful popular activity these days so we often double em up

ah god its barbaric however you look at it he told ruth

what cremation she asked

humans are about to grasp basic substances of all creations

when that moment comes life or death are no longer matters

dont you have a religion dorolow asked horza

yes he replied not taking his eyes away from the screen on the wall above the end of the main messroom table my survival

so your religion dies with you how sad dorolow said looking back from horza to the screen the changer let the remark pass

as if the dead really do persist even in a bottle of wine

deaththe abyss from where no traveler is permitted to return

life garp wrote is sadly not structured like a good oldfashioned novel instead an end occurs when those who are meant to peter out have petered out all that is left is memory but even a nihilist has memory

nothing shall part us in our love till thanatos death at his appointed hour removed us from the light of day

but now as it is sorrows unending sorrows must surge within your heart as well—for your own son’s death never again will you embrace him stiding home my spirit rebels—i’ve lost the will to live to take my stand in the world of men—

fife simply walked off by himself into the jungle to look at all the things which would continue to exist after he had ceased to there were a lot of them fife looked at them all they remained singularly unchanged by his scrutiny

cad é an mhaith dom eagla a bheith orm ní shaorfadh eagla duine ón mbás dar ndóigh

what is this slow blue dream of living

and this fevered death by dreaming

it seems that the people of oran are like that friend of flaubert who on the point of death casting a last glance at the irreplaceable earth exclaimed close the window its too beautiful

would that death were like this would that one would sleep and sleep and sleep forever

i fear too early for my mind misgives

some consequence yet hanging in the stars

shall bitterly begin his fearful date

with this nights revels and expire the term

of a despisèd life closed in my breast

by some vile forfeit of untimely death

but he that hath the steerage of my course

direct my sail

here is a minute it may be my love is dead but here is a minute to kneel over the grave and pray by it

he wanted to die he prayed for it through the roar in his ears he begged for it

if life is worth living for so is it worth dying

mostly i couldnt bear the paltry notion that memory was all that eternal life really meant and i spent too much time wondering where people got the fortitude or delusion to keep on moving past the static dead

when will the death

from the siege

may be able to die those who didnt know how to live

little soul you charming little wanderer my bodys guest and partner

where are you off to now

somewhere without colour savage and bare

youll crack no more of your jokes once youre there

the misfortune is that although everyone must come to death each experiences the adventure in solitude we never left maman during those last days and yet we were profoundly separated from her

it was in the reign of george ii that the abovenamed personages lived and quarrelled  good or bad handsome or ugly rich or poor they are all equal now

standing upright her eyes meeting my disapproving look she mutters between teeth reddened by cola nuts lady death is just as beautiful as life has been

i want you to tell all these people that i wanted more time to spend with them tell them i meant to tell them i wanted to hear what they said and tell them what was on my mind

the barrow

in this high field strewn with stones

i walk by a green mound

its edges sheared by the plough

lie smashed and scattered round

under the clover leaves

and slivers of flint seem to grow

in the wind the chestnut heaves

where a mans grave has been

whatever the barrow held

once has been taken away

a hollow of nettles and dock

lies at the centre filled

with rain from a sky so grey

it reflects nothing at all

i poke in the crumbled rock

for something they left behind

but after that funeral

there is nothing at all to find

on the map in front of me

the gothic letters pick out

dozens of tombs like this

no fragments littered about

of a dead and buried race

in the margins of histories

no fragments these splintered bones

construct no human face

these stones are simply stones

in museums their urns lie

behind glass and their shaped flints

are labelled like butterflies

all that they did was die

and all that has happened since

means nothing to this place

above long clouds the skies

turn to a brilliant red

and show in the waters face

one living and not these dead

— anthony thwaite from the owl in the tree

aunt rosa a fussy angular wildeyed old lady who had lived in a tremulous world of bad news bankruptcies train accidents cancerous growths—until the germans put her to death together with all the people she had worried about

its like a memorial to atlantis or lyonesse these are the stone buoys that mark a drowned world

can there be anything more sad than a girl dying on the day of her first communion in her new dress a little bride of death

i am not afraid of death which after all cant be far away what does frighten me though is the halfway stage

we are all created by desire and we all die because of desire

the dead were just the dead neither awful nor remarkable history separated out these individuals and preserved their names where others were obilterated for ever

only the debris of wreckage and not much of that was left behind by the sharks who fed on tragedy the fishermen too mourned the death of a living child

just when you think youre in the catbirds seat the angel of death calls dibs on shotgun

death preserves an ideal

the dead and notyet dead we are company all together

places change imperceptibly – in detail at least – a good deal said the doctor making an effort to keep up a conversation that plainly would not go on itself and people too population shifts – theres an old fellow sir they call death

they had lived and known glory and then they were ddead she was alive and they were not and nothing but a heartbeat separated her from them

of my conception i know only what you know of yours it occurred in darkness and i was unconsenting by some bleak alchemy what had been mere unbeing becomes death when life is mingled with it

as he walked the sad faded leaves were driven pitilessly around him by the wind and under the mingling influences of autumn and evening a craving for the quietude of the grave … overtook him with unwanted intensity

when the dead departed they took away any falsehoods that they might have allowed us to believe while alive we who are left behind have to embark on a different life since the dead are no longer here to help us deceive ourselves

it is brutal only i never could see the sense in having folks look at your tombstone and say he was a man who didnt believe in violence hes a good man and dead

is dust immortal then i askd him so that we may see it blowing through the centuries but as walter gave no answer i jested with him further to break his melancholy humour what is dust master pyne

and he reflected a little it is particles of matter no doubt

then we are all dust indeed are we not

and in a feigned voice he murmered for dust thou art and shalt to dust return then he made a sour face but only yo laugh the more

i should not really object to dying were it not followed by death

the taste one gets of death in dreams i find more penetrating and atmospheric than the ordinary fear one might suffer while awake

what delightful hosts are they—

life and love

this late hour yet glad enough

they have not withheld from me

their high hospitality

so with face lit with delight

and all gratitude i stay

yet to press their hands and say

thanks—so fine a time good night

life versus death becomes as montaigne pointed out old age versus death

death is only a small interruption

raise from your bed of languor

raise from your bed of dismay

your friends will not come tomorrow

as they did not come today

you must rely on yourself they said

you must rely on yourself

oh but i find this pill so bitter said the poor man

as he took it from the shelf

crying o sweet death come to me

come to me for company

sweet death it is only you i can

phoebe asked me tell me what do you think of the afterlife

i rather think she replied that total annihilation is the most comfortable position

i was shaken the horse clopped on the children laughed behind us

when i die she said i dont expect to see any of my loved ones again ill just become a part of all this she waved her hand at the surrounding countryside thats all right with me

the face of the dead man was concealed of course our customs not being those of the south where corpses are carried to the grave in open coffins that they might – one last time before slipping into the pit – be warmed by the light of the sun

curiosity is a good thing like onion soup but too much onion soup makes your breath smell terrible and too much curiosity can make your whole body smell terrible if it causes you to be dead

your father was no longer a young man he was already in his fifties

fiftysix the old woman repeated his body had been weakened the ocean had left him vulnerable pneumonia took hold of him and in time he died

because of mickey eddie said

because of loyalty she said

people don’t die because of loyalty

they don’t she smiled religion government are we not loyal to such things sometimes to the death

better she said to be loyal to one another

only fools insist upon life at any cost others would say that life may be laid down when it becomes too heavy where does it go after all but into the keeping of the powers who gave it and will give it once again

the deaths field is the mirror which allows us the knowledge of the world we living in

whenever a soul leaves the body a void is felt across the world

belief in immortality is harmful because it is not in our power to conceive of the soul as really incorporeal so this belief is in fact a belief in the prolongation of life and it robs death of its purpose

well never know exactly why we are what we are and so on all you can do is follow your path all the way to the wilderness and then you continue along because thats what must be

we have already said more goodbyes than are necessary those were goodbyes that brought about the end of partings we taught each other that no parting is possible

one foot in front of the other was all she could manage

death to the young is more than that undiscovered country despite its inevitability it is a place having reality only in song or in other peoples grief

lifes a queue of small irritations with the last door at the end

i think about death sometimes analytically of course

three things have a limited threshold

time pain and death

while truth love and knowledge –

are boundless

three things are needed

for humanity to coexist

truth peace and basic needs

the air smelled of a limited life expectancy

you dont even have a cross he said his beloved was silent you dont even have any candles no face of christ no tears what can i say

then she began to murmur and he was astonished

this was her only glimpse of heaven and she wept so much that he was afraid finally she held his hand the two brothers fired the cannon at the burial

everything is unfinished  our whole lives

we’re all carrying our coffins with us every day or we are all constantly cheating death

we were too greedy grasping for immortality too soon perhaps if we had only been patient content to wait we would all have forever in the end

remember pia he whispers perfect is as perfect does

maybe as mizuko said we wont even really die just carry on in the feedback loop we are stuck in instead of connecting with new things widening our worlds algorithms have shrunk it to a narrow chamber with mirrored walls

through christ the sting of death is but a gentle pinch to the soul and the mourn is light perhaps someday in that glorious place free of sin we shall meet again

even after somebody dies you can still keep learning about them

the city outside so busy so full of life seemed in stark contrast to the deathly silence inside their home it seemedlike a muffled silence as if the house itself was holding its breath waiting

beauty can be born out of not only love but also pain and other motivations

in billion years the sun will expand  engulf our orbit as the charred ember that was once earth vaporizes have a nice day

may the light be in you forever

may the sun love you and keep you

may the dream make you awaken

for the stars love to shine upon you

and the heavens cry for your loss

may goodness and love flow

through you once more

drink of the light and the love here

find that we all need you

may your spirit come back across

technically all tattoos are temporary even permanent ones

one day we were born one day we shall die the same day the same second

the only thing really worth doing in this life is giving love to everyone around you

i am no wise man every day shows me how little i know about life and how wrong i can be but there are things i know to be true i know i will die and i know that the only sane response to such a horror is to love

he wasnt supposed to die he cried out somewhat desperately petulantly like a spoiled child but i could hear other thoughts racing between us

neither are you

neither am i

shell be waiting for me never before had he wanted immortality so badly

immortality it is impossible to be conscious of being unconscious

how do you know you are dead it is not possible to be aware of any gaps in life it is continuous and neverending from your own point of view

death and birth are a continuous event from your own perspective

you will die physically but you will be born into a new physical body being born happens or you would not be here now you were born into this life it is what we know happens there is no evidence anything else happens true or false

walk a bit further

there is a different land not far away

the people in it have the magic to break the icy fingers of the great death

i heard that you don’t even have to pay

however you have to find their door

it is only found by those who pay the other price

i sat all morning in the college sick bay

counting bells knelling classes to a close

at two oclock our neighbours drove me home

in the porch i met my father crying—

he had always taken funerals in his stride—

and big jim evans saying it was a hard blow

the baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram

when i came in and i was embarrassed

by old men standing up to shake my hand

and tell me they were sorry for my trouble

whispers informed strangers i was the eldest

away at school as my mother held my hand

in hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs

at ten oclock the ambulance arrived

with the corpse stanched and bandaged by the nurses

next morning i went up into the room snowdrops

and candles soothed the bedside i saw him

for the first time in six weeks paler now

wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple

he lay in the fourfoot box as in his cot

no gaudy scars the bumper knocked him clear

a fourfoot box a foot for every year

pain has a threshold and so does death

if one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child then one million of you are a million times guilty

i know i should look away let him grieve in private but i cannot the sweet girl that i knew only briefly is the key to this gentle beast who has captured my heart

everyone feels guilty before a mother who has lost her son in a war throughout human history men have tried in vain to justify themselves

as adam brought death so christ brought life as adam is the father of mortality so christ is the father of immortality

joan wernick said she took two lessons from the crash you’re going to die when you’re supposed to die

but death is not easily escaped from by anyone all of us with souls earthdwellers and children of men must make our way to a destination already ordained where the body after the banqueting sleeps on its deathbed

we were playing a game against an unknown and unforgiving opponent the stakes were terrible—play well or die—but we didn’t even know the ground rules

life makes beggars out of those who have joyful hearts taxing the living with hardship and tribulation but the charity of companionship the currency of shared and unmitigated love alleviates all disconsolation

as he walked along the runway he came upon a united airlines pilot he tried to sit up martz said i saw a huge triangular hole in his forehead and i told him to just lie still and that help was on the way but it was too late for him

if one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty

he saw at least a dozen people still in their seats their clothes were torn or blown or burned from their bodies completely naked in front missing limbs missing faces some breathing some moaning and others just deader than a door nail

no crime is a means to an end no crime can be rationalized
