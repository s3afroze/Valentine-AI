my soul doth magnify the lord

and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior

people who cease to believe in god or goodness altogether still believe in the devil evil is always possible and goodness is eternally difficult

we fear men so much because we fear god so little one fear cures another when mans terror scares you turn your thoughts to the wrath of god

i have found god but he is insufficient

one of the main reasons that we lose our enthusiasm in life is because we become ungratefulwe let what was once a miracle become common to us we get so accustomed to his goodness it becomes a routine

give me the love that leads the way

the faith that nothing can dismay

the hope no disappointments tire

the passion thatll burn like fire

let me not sink to be a clod

the cross is gods way of taking away all of our accusations excuses and arguments

the cross is god taking on flesh and blood and saying me too

the reality of loving god is loving him like hes a superhero who actually saved you from stuff rather than a santa claus who merely gave you some stuff

i think that i shall never see

a poem lovely as a tree

a tree whose hungry mouth is pressed

against the earths sweet flowing breast

a tree that looks at god all day

and lifts her leafy arms to pray

a tree that may in summer wear

a nest of robins in her hair

upon whose bosom snow has lain

who intimately lives with rain

poems are made by fools like me

but only god can make a tree

when faith replaces doubt when selfless service eliminates selfish striving the power of god brings to pass his purposes

we are women and my plea is let me be a woman holy through and through asking for nothing but what god wants to give me receiving with both hands and with all my heart whatever that is

for hate is strong

and mocks the song

of peace on earth goodwill to men

then pealed the bells more loud and deep

the right prevail

with peace on earth goodwill to men

i used to wonder if it was gods plan that i should be alone for so much of my life but i found peace i found happiness within people and the world

its all gods will you can die in your sleep and god can spare you in battle

when everything gets answered its fake

my arms are too short to box with god

we are nearer to him than his jugular vein

god is no fonder of intellectual slackers than he is of any other slacker

lift your hips for me love

just because you can explain it doesnt mean its not still a miracle

if in thirst you drink water from a cup you see god in it those who are not in love with god will see only their own faces in it

he who has god and everything else has no more than he who has god only

we have never heard the devils side of the story god wrote all the book

yahweh youve been unhappy because youve desired things that cannot be

lucifer thats what desire is the need for what we cant have the need for whats readily available is called greed

i can no more understand the totality of god than the pancake i made for breakfast understands the complexity of me

the grace of god means something like here is your life you might never have been but you are because the party wouldnt have been complete without you

love is as simple as the absence of self given to another god when invited fills the void of any unrequited love hence loving is how one is drawn closer to god no matter its most horrific repercussions

god is the same everywhere

how come when mortals want things their only option is to make a deal with hell and sell their soul why can’t they make deals with god in exchange for good behavior

then who are they making them with i exclaimed

themselves

you will never glory in god till first of all god has killed your glorying in yourself

should we wave a flag and tell the buddhists that we have proof the buddha did not come from a lotus blossom or that jesus was not born of a literal virgin birth those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical

if absolute power corrupts absolutely where does that leave god

to have found god and still to pursue him is the soul’s paradox of love

woman is the light of god

if money’s the god people worship i’d rather go worship the devil instead

a lonely day is gods way of saying that he wants to spend some quality time with you

i gave in and admitted that god was god

for those who believe no proof is necessary for those who dont believe no proof is possible

and my god will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in christ jesus

i seemed to hear god saying put down your gun and well talk

what the soul hardly realizes is that unbeliever or not his loneliness is really a homesickness for god

i dont try to imagine a personal god it suffices to stand in awe at the structure of the world insofar as it allows our inadequate senses to appreciate it

god dwells within you as you

love is the only future god offers

in god there is no hunger that needs to be filled only plenteousness that desires to give

dont believe in god love the world just the way it is

pray hope and dont worry worry is useless god is merciful and will hear your prayer

god might work on mysterious ways but hell worked on efficient ones

suppose neutral angels were able to talk yahweh and lucifer – god and satan to use their popular titles – into settling out of court what would be the terms of the compromise specifically how would they divide the assets of their early kingdom

thank god men cannot fly and lay waste the sky as well as the earth

i think you have every right to cherrypick when it comes to moving your spirit and finding peace in god you take whatever works from wherever you can find it and you keep moving toward the light

the query at auschwitz tell me where was god

and the answer where was man

are those real islands asked the young prince

of course they are real islands said the man in evening dress

and those strange and troubling creatures

they are all genuine and authentic princesses

then god must exist cried the prince

i am god replied the man in full evening dress with a bow

the young prince returned home as quickly as he could

so you are back said the father the king

i have seen islands i have seen princesses i have seen god said the prince reproachfully

the king was unmoved

neither real islands nor real princesses i have seen god said the prince reproachfully

the king was unmoved

neither real islands nor real princesses nor a real god exist

i saw them

tell me how god was dressed

were the sleeves of his coat rolled back

the prince remembered that they had been the king smiled

that is the uniform of a magician you have been deceived

at this the prince returned to the next land and went to the same shore where once again he came upon the man in full evening dress

my father the king has told me who you are said the young prince indignantly you deceived me last time but not again now i know that those are not real islands and real princesses because you are a magician

the man on the shore smiled

it is you who are deceived my boy in your fathers kingdom there are many islands and many princesses but you are under your fathers spell so you cannot see them

the prince pensively returned home when he saw his father he looked him in the eyes

father is it true that you are not a real king but only a magician

the king smiled and rolled back his sleeves

yes my son i am only a magician

then the man on the shore was god

the man on the shore was another magician

i must know the real truth the truth beyond magic

there is no truth beyond magic said the king

the prince was full of sadness

he said i will kill myself

the king by magic caused death to appear death stood in the door and beckoned to the prince the prince shuddered he remembered the beautiful but unreal islands and the unreal but beautiful princesses

very well he said i can bear it

you see my son said the king you too now begin to be a magician

to judge from the notions expounded by theologians one must conclude that god created most men simply with a view to crowding hell

love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated

truth is the handmaiden of love

dialogue is the pathway to truth

humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn

to learn is to die voluntarily and be born again in great ways and small

so speech must be untrammeled

so that dialogue can take place

so that we can all humbly learn

so that truth can serve love

so that suffering can be ameliorated

so that we can all stumble forward to the kingdom of god

stop asking god to bless what youre doing find out what gods doing its already blessed

if the concept of god has any validity or any use it can only be to make us larger freer and more loving if god cannot do this then it is time we got rid of him

beloved let us love one another because love is from god everyone one who loves is born of god and knows god whoever does not love does not know god for god is love

im convinced that most men dont know what they believe rather they only know what they wish to believe how many people blame god for mans atrocities but wouldnt dream of imprisoning a mother for her sons crime

god put us here on this carnival ride we close our eyes never knowing where itll take us next

you cannot conceive nor can i of the appalling strangeness of the mercy of god

day after day day after day

we stuck nor breath nor motion

as idle as a painted ship

whatever god requires is right no matter what it is although we may not see the reason there of until all of the events transpire

youre gonna have to serve somebody well it may be the devil or it may be the lord but youre gonna have to serve somebody

every child comes with the message that god is not yet discouraged of man

i have to believe much in god because i have lost my faith in man

were called to be faithful to take those first difficult stepsand to leave the results up to god

harper in your experience of the world how do people change

mormon mother well it has something to do with god so its not very nice

harper and then up you get and walk around

mormon mother just mangled guts pretending

harper thats how people change

god is whispering in your heart in the whole existence just tune your ears

i could not believe in a god that would challenge faith like this

your prayer for someone may or may not change them but it always changes you

there is nothing more important than your eternal salvation

did god ever cry over his lost angel i wonder

the more humble and obedient to god a man is the more wise and at peace he will be in all that he does

we can never know who or what we are till we know at least something of what god is

perfect prayer does not consist in many words silent remembering and pure intention raises the heart to that supreme power

the common man prays i want a cookie right now and god responds if youd listen to what i say tomorrow it will bring you  cookies

he has not created me for naught i shall do good i shall do his work i shall be an angel of peace a preacher of truth in my own place while not intending it if i do but keep his commandments

let every man abide in the calling wherein he is called and his work will be as sacred as the work of the ministry it is not what a man does that determines whether his work is sacred or secular it is why he does it

without god life has no purpose and without purpose life has no meaning without meaning life has no significance or hope

god is really only another artist he invented the giraffe the elephant and the cat he has no real style he just goes on trying other things

oh god of dust and rainbows

help us to see

that without the dust the rainbow

would not be

let nothing disturb you

let nothing frighten you

all things are passing away

patience obtains all things

whoever has god lacks nothing

the world takes us to a silver screen on which flickering images of passion and romance play and as we watch the world says this is love god takes us to the foot of a tree on which a naked and bloodied man hangs and says this is love

i tell of hearts and souls and dances

butterflies and second chances

desperate ones and dreamers bound

seeking life from barren ground

who suffer on in earthly fate

the bitter pain of agony hate

might but they stop and here forgive

would break the bonds to breathe and live

and find that god in goodness brings

a chance for change the hope of wings

to rest in him and self to die

and so become a butterfly

why not

because if youre dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they wont give up theyll get you in the end

youre here to be light bringing out the godcolors in the world

matthew  the message

personally i do not want to make you a man men are so very frail men break men die no i’ve always wished to make a god

and god is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work

lucifer spoke thus pride took him from heaven though he sat at gods right hand her voice grew faint the hint of a whisper in the end pride is the only evil the root of all sins

pride is all i have

in the heartfelt mercy of our god the dawn from on high will visit us to shine on those sitting in darkness in the shadow of death to guide our feet to the way of peace

i perceive god everywhere in his works i sense him in me i see him all around me

if god really existed it would be necessary to abolish him

i always thought when i got older that god would sort of come into my life in some way he didnt i dont blame him if i was him id have the same opinion about me that he does

he who thinks halfheartedly will not believe in god but he who really thinks has to believe in god

poor god how often he is blamed for all the suffering in the

world it’s like praising satan for allowing all the good that happens

may each of us remember this truth one cannot forget mother and remember god one cannot remember mother and forget god why because these two sacred persons god and mother partners in creation in love in sacrifice in service are as one

we never know how god will answer our prayers but we can expect that he will get us involved in his plan for the answer if we are true intercessors we must be ready to take part in god’s work on behalf of the people for whom we pray

i have too much respect for the idea of god to make it responsible for such an absurd world

why do humans exist a major part of the answer because pikaia gracilens survived the burgess decimation

for every thing that lives is holy

if you understood him it would not be god

its our faith that activates the power of god

imagination is the voice of daring if there is anything godlike about god it is that he dared to imagine everything

that god does not exist i cannot deny that my whole being cries out for god i cannot forget

all this twaddle the existence of god atheism determinism liberation societies death etc are pieces of a chess game called language and they are amusing only if one does not preoccupy oneself with winning or losing this game of chess

if god exists i hope he has a good excuse

god send me anywhere only go with me lay any burden on me only sustain me and sever any tie in my heart except the tie that binds my heart to yours

the power of god is with you at all times through the activities of mind senses breathing and emotions and is constantly doing all the work using you as a mere instrument

god gave us crying so other folks could see when we needed help and help us

the nurse smiled and patted my arm don’t give up yet sometimes when we think god has written the end what he really means is the beginning

on forgiveness didnt he and i stand together before an all seeing god convicted of the same murder for i had murdered him with my heart and my tongue

the idea of god infinity or spirit stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception

she has mans braina brain that a man should have were he much giftedand womans heart the good god fashioned her for a purpose believe me when he made that so good combination

if pinpointing gods presence were really that simple then he supposed the beaches would be more crowded in the mornings they would be filled with people on their own quests instead of people jogging or walking their dogs or fishing in the surf

only god is awesome

gods only excuse is that he does not exist

theological formation is the gradual and often painful discovery of gods incomprehensibility you can be competent in many things but you cannot be competent in god

even when god seemed to have abandoned me he was watching even when he seemed indifferent to my suffering he was watching and when i was beyond all hope of saving he gave me rest then he gave me a sign to continue my journey

we unwittingly project onto god our own attitudes and feelings toward ourselves but we cannot assume that he feels about us the way we feel about ourselves  unless we love ourselves compassionately intensely and freely

like when you sit in front of a fire in winter — you are just there in front of the fire you dont have to be smart or anything the fire warms you

god is the color of water water doesnt have a color

becuse god loves us but the devil takes an interest

our heaven is their hell said god i like a balanced universe

nevers the word god listens for when he needs a laugh

you are not what others think you are you are what god knows you are

for the happy man prayer is only a jumble of words until the day when sorrow comes to explain to him the sublime language by means of which he speaks to god

it is said that god has created man in his own image but it may be that humankind has created god in the image of humankind

give me one hundred preachers who fear nothing but sin and desire nothing but god and i care not a straw whether they be clergymen or laymen such alone will shake the gates of hell and set up the kingdom of heaven on earth

this most beautiful system of the sun planets and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being

this being governs all things not as the soul of the world but as lord over all and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called lord god παντοκρατωρ or universal ruler

the soul is like an uninhabited world

that comes to life only when

god lays his head

against us

people who fit don’t seek the seekers are those that don’t fit

so india’s problem turns out to be the world’s problem what happened in india has happened in god’s name

the problem’s name is god

why worry about minor little details like clean air clean water safe ports and the safety net when jesus is going to give the world an extreme makeover planet edition right after he finishes putting satan in his place once and for all

there is a god part in you the consciousness the pure self learn to listen the voice of that power

why would an allpowerful creator decide to plant his carefully crafted species on islands and continents in exactly the appropriate pattern to suggest irresistibly that they had evolved and dispersed from the site of their evolution

science can teach us and i think our hearts can teach us no longer to look around for imaginary supporters no longer to invent allies in the sky but rather to look to our own efforts here below to make the world a fit place to live

was there ever a more horrible blasphemy than the statement that all the knowledge of god is confined to this or that book how dare men call god infinite and yet try to compress him within the covers of a little book

some of the most beautiful things we have in life comes from our mistakes

when did you feel your

most euphoric kiss

was i the source

of your greatest bliss

children and dogs are the messengers of god some of us do not deserve them

and why does this same god tell me how to raise my children when he had to drown his

science adjusts its views based on whats observed

faith is the denial of observation so that belief can be preserved

be a man what good is religion if it collapses under calamity think of what earthquakes and floods wars and volcanoes have done before to men did you think that god had exempted us he is not an insurance agent

faith does not need to push the river because faith is able to trust that there is a river the river is flowing we are in it

defeat is for the valiant only they will know the honour of losing and the joy of winning

i am not here to tell you that defeat is a part of life we all know that only the defeated know love because it is in the realm of love that we fight our first battles – and generally lose

i am here to tell you that there are people who have never been defeated

they are the ones who never fought

they managed to avoid scars humiliations feelings of helplessness as well as those moments when even warriors doubt the existence of god’’

not all dreamers are winners but all winners are dreamers your dream is the key to your future the bible says that without a vision dream a people perish you need a dream if youre going to succeed in anything you do

– but here is a question that is troubling me if there is no god then one may ask who governs human life and in general the whole order of things on earth

– man governs it himself – homeless angrily hastened to reply to this admittedly nonetooclear question

in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth

i dont know if god exists but it would be better for his reputation if he didnt

we all long for eden and we are constantly glimpsing it our whole nature at its best and least corrupted its gentlest and most human is still soaked with the sense of exile

imagination is a gift given to us from god and each one of us use it differently

i am striving to give back the divine in myself to the divine in the all

my father chose my name  and my last name was chosen by my ancestors  that’s enough i myself choose my way

entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for wither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god

in my opinion there are two things that can absolutely not be carried to the screen the realistic presentation of the sexual act and praying to god

with lovely flowers strown

but one straight narrow pathway

that was not overgrown

and to this beauteous garden

he brought mankind to live

and said to you my children

these lovely flowers i give

prune ye my vines and fig trees

with care my flowers tend

but keep the pathway open

your home is at the end

gods garden

you can con god and get away with it granny said if you do so with charm and wit if you live your life with imagination and verve god will play along just to see what outrageously entertaining thing youll do next

he who defends with love will be secure heaven will save him and protect him with love

it always strikes me and it is very peculiar that whenever we see the image of indescribable and unutterable desolation—of loneliness poverty and misery the end and extreme of things—the thought of god comes into ones mind

god doesnt like lesbians grandma huberman hised throwing the magazine in the trash

in me is working a power stronger than every other power the life that is in me is a thousand times bigger than i am outside

the same sun that rises over castles and welcomes the day

spills over buildings into the streets where orphans play

and only you can see the good in broken things

you took my heart of stone and you made it home

and set this prisoner free

let us practice the fine art of making every work a priestly ministration let us believe that god is in all our simple deeds and learn to find him there

yet a part of you still believes you can fight and survive no matter what your mind knows its not so strange where theres still life theres still hope what happens is up to god

sometimes what i wouldnt give to have us sitting in a bar again at  am telling lies to one another far from god

dont sit back and wait for god to do it all ask for his advice but be prepared to do the hard yards yourself

there were a lot of gods gods always come in handy they justify almost anything

what do people mean when they say i am not afraid of god because i know he is good have they never even been to a dentist

if you violate laws of god youre a sinner

if you violate laws of men youre a criminal

if you violate your own laws youre pathetic

there is no god nature sufficeth unto herself in no wise hath she need of an author

those who believe that they believe in god but without passion in their hearts without anguish in mind without uncertainty without doubt without an element of despair even in their consolation believe only in the god idea not god himself

the best remedy for those who are afraid lonely or unhappy is to go outside somewhere where they can be quite alone with the heavens nature and god

waking up is not a selfish pursuit of happiness it is a revolutionary stance from the inside out for the benefit of all beings in existence

i wouldnt burden any decent system of faith by participating in it im not agnostic just nonpartisan theological switzerland thats me

then he paused for a second and said yea but sometimes i think it’s just like an onoff switch click and you’re gone and then he paused again and said  and that’s why i don’t like putting onoff switches on apple devices

joy to the world there is an afterlife

god does not require that we be successful only that we be faithful

people make the rules of society not god

we were given the scriptures to humble us into realizing that god is right and the rest of us are just guessing

but he was pierced for our transgressions

he was crushed for our iniquities

the punishment that brought us peace was upon him

and by his wounds we are healed

the beauty of collaboration between older and younger generations is that we combine strength with wisdom—a surefire way to accomplish more for the glory of god

i have never understood why people who can swallow the enormous improbability of a personal god boggle at a personal devil

submit to god and be at peace with him in this way prosperity will come to you

when the lord makes it clear youre to follow him in this new direction focus fully on him and refuse to be distracted by comparisons with others

for he who loves god without faith reflects on himself while the person who loves god in faith reflects on god

are your convictions so fragile that mine cannot stand in opposition to them is your god so illusory that the presence of my devil reveals his insufficiency

o god — please give him back i shall keep asking you

if you want to be reminded of the love of the lord just watch the sunrise

even god has a hell his love of mankind

we sinned for no reason but an incomprehensible lack of love and he saved us for no reason but an incomprehensible excess of love

in the year  a person can have sufficient intellectual and material resources to build a nuclear bomb and still believe that he will get seventytwo virgins in paradise

are we biology or god or something higher i know my heart beats and i listen to it the beat is biology but what is the song

did i hear god call me an idiot

i found my god in music and the arts with writers like hermann hesse and musicians like muddy waters howlin wolf and little walter in some way in some form my god was always there but now i have learned to talk to him

gods creatures who cried themselves to sleep stirred to cry again

please god im only fourteen years old a teenager have mercy be loving

i was says god for eons and look at what it got me you

god does not give us more than we can handle i am told but i wonder if god doesnt overestimate me just a little or perhaps and this is likely i underestimate god

listen god love everything you love  and a mess of stuff you dont but more than anything else god love admiration

you saying god vain i ast

naw she say not vain just wanting to share a good thing i think it pisses god off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and dont notice it

what it do when it pissed off i ast

oh it make something else people think pleasing god is all god care about but any fool living in the world can see it always trying to please us back

when i stand before thee at the days end thou shalt see my scars and know that i had my wounds and also my healing

god who am i

those with less curiosity or ambition just mumble that god works in mysterious ways i intend to catch him in the act

jamie in brother andrews the calling

do what you do only for gods sake start for gods sake work for gods sake and act within the sphere of gods good approval

let your life reflect the faith you have in god fear nothing and pray about everything be strong trust gods word and trust the process

live in the wisdom of accepted tenderness tenderness awakens within the security of knowing we are thoroughly and sincerely liked by someone

scripture suggests that the essence of the divine nature is compassion and that the heart of god is defined by tenderness

closing his eyes royce brushed a kiss against her smooth forehead thank you he thought

and in his heart he could have sworn he heard a voice answer youre welcome

we must be ready to learn from one another not claiming that we alone possess all truth and that somehow we have a corner on god

i am sunai he said i am holy fire and if i have to burn the world to cleanse it so help me i will

you are the perfect creation of god dont allow you to be down god is experiencing through you

do you know that nothing you do in this life will ever matter unless it is about loving god and loving the people he has made

my feeling is quite simply that if there is a god he has done such a bad job

that he isnt worth discussing

but for me the sweetest contact with god has no form i close my eyes look within and enter a deep soft silence the infinity of gods creation embraces me

the greatest enemy of hunger for god is not poison but apple pie

it is not the banquet of the wicked that dulls our appetite for

heaven but endless nibbling at the table of the world it is not

the xrated video but the primetime dribble of triviality we

we might be wise to follow the insight of the enraptured heart rather than the more cautious reasoning of the theological mind

therefore since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us be thankful and so worship god acceptably with reverence and awe for our god is a consuming fire

come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light

the more you go with the flow of life and surrender the outcome to god and the less you seek constant clarity the more you will find that fabulous things start to show up in your life

don’t be disheartened by the forces of evil nothing can happen that god hasn’t allowed even resistance is all part of grand orchestration the devil always has you right were god wants you

nor does god whisper through the trees his voice is not to be mistaken when men hear it they fall to their knees and their souls are riven and they cry out to him and there is no fear but only wildness of heart that springs from such longing

there is something infantile in the presumption that somebody else has a responsibility to give your life meaning and point… the truly adult view by contrast is that our life is as meaningful as full and as wonderful as we choose to make it

they call him aslan in that place said eustace

what a curious name

not half so curious as himself said eustace solemnly

my god if i had a heart i would write my hate on ice and wait for the sun to show

when man is with god in awe and love then he is praying

if god sends us on strong paths we are provided strong shoes

i need a god who is bigger and more nimble and mysterious than what i could understand and contrive otherwise it can feel like i am worshipping nothing more than my own ability to understand the divine

since that day there is nothing anyone could ever say to convince me that one person cannot change a nation one person can do unbelievable things all it takes is that one person whos willing to risk everything to make it happen

there must be must be a first mover existing above all – and this we call god

god is the most beautiful and beauty is the expression of god if you cant appreciate beauty in the world how can you understand god

the same everlasting father who cares for you today will care for you tomorrow and every day

either he will shield you from suffering or give you unfailing strength to bear it

be at peace then and put aside all anxious thoughts and imaginings

it is far more comforting to think god listened and said no than to think that nobody’s out there

don’t tell me about your god with your words show me about your god with your actions

god will judge us mr harris byby what we did to relieve the suffering of our fellow human beings i dont think god cares what doctrine we embrace

my son ﻿do not forget my teaching

but let your heart ﻿keep my commandments

for ﻿length of days and years of life

and peace they will add to you

do not let ﻿﻿kindness and truth leave you

bind them around your neck

write them on the tablet of your heart

so you will ﻿find favor and good repute

in the sight of god and man

trust in the lord with all your heart

and ﻿do not lean on your own understanding

in all your ways ﻿acknowledge him

and he will ﻿make your paths straight

prayer will make a man cease from sin or sin will entice a man to cease from prayer

it i ast

yeah it god aint a he or a she but a it

but what do it look like i ast

oh she say god love all them feelings thats some of the best stuff god did and when you know god loves em you enjoys em a lot more you can just relax go with everything thats going and praise god by liking what you like

god dont think it dirty i ast

naw she say god made it listen god love everything you love and a mess of stuff you dont but more than anything else god love admiration

you saying god vain i ast

naw she say not vain just wanting to share a good thing i think it pisses god off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and dont notice it

what it do when it pissed off i ast

oh it make something else people think pleasing god is all god care about but any fool living in the world can see it always trying to please us back

yeah she say it always making little surprises and springing them on us when us least expect

you mean it want to be loved just like the bible say

yes celie she say everything want to be loved us sing and dance make faces and give flower bouquets trying to be loved you ever notice that trees do everything to git attention we do except walk

man corrupt everything say shug he on your box of grits in your head and all over the radio he try to make you think he everywhere

soon as you think he everywhere you think he god but he aint whenever you trying to pray and man plop himself on the other end of it tell him to git lost say shug conjure up flowers windwater a big rock

but this hard work let me tell you he been there so long he dont want to budge he threaten lightening floods and earthquakes us fight i hardly pray at all every time i conjure up a rock i throw it

every man is a divinity in disguise a god playing the fool

and no matter how far they try to go the other way – to extend life play around with the genes clone this clone that live to one hundred and fifty – at some point life is over and then what happens when the life comes to an end

you see

he leaned back he smiled

when you come to the end that’s where god begins

god’s word is not just to be heard and repeated it is to be breathed lived and emulated with each action

once you have surrendered yourself you make yourself receptive in receiving from god you are perfected and completed

my faith is big enough to accept all of gods wonders

god created man and finding him not sufficiently alone gave him a companion to make him feel his solitude more keenly

god who foresaw your tribulation has specially armed you to go through it not without pain but without stain

what we are is gods gift to us what we become is our gift to god

you do not have to be shamed in my closeness family are the people who must never make you feel ashamed

you are wrong family are the people who must make you feel ashamed when you are deserving of shame

and you are deserving of shame

i am i am trying to tell you we were stupid he said because we believed in things

why is this stupid

because there are not things to believe in

there is no love only the end of love

do not be a fool

if god exists he is not to be believed in

if i stopped loving him i would cease to believe in his love if i loved god then i would believe in his love for me its not enough to need it we have to love first and i dont know how but i need it how i need it

family friends and relationships are the blessings of the god they are the best way to access god

the great commandment is that we preach the gospel to every creature but neither god nor the bible says anything about forcing it down peoples throats

a brief for the defense

sorrow everywhere slaughter everywhere if babies

are not starving someplace they are starving

somewhere else with flies in their nostrils

but we enjoy our lives because thats what god wants

otherwise the mornings before summer dawn would not

be made so fine the bengal tiger would not

be fashioned so miraculously well the poor women

at the fountain are laughing together between

the suffering they have known and the awfulness

in their future smiling and laughing while somebody

in the village is very sick there is laughter

every day in the terrible streets of calcutta

and the women laugh in the cages of bombay

if we deny our happiness resist our satisfaction

we lessen the importance of their deprivation

we must risk delight we can do without pleasure

but not delight not enjoyment we must have

the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless

furnace of this world to make injustice the only

measure of our attention is to praise the devil

if the locomotive of the lord runs us down

we should give thanks that the end had magnitude

we must admit there will be music despite everything

we stand at the prow again of a small ship

anchored late at night in the tiny port

looking over to the sleeping island the waterfront

is three shuttered cafés and one naked light burning

to hear the faint sound of oars in the silence as a rowboat

comes slowly out and then goes back is truly worth

all the years of sorrow that are to come

ill pray that you grow up a brave man in a brave country i will pray you find a way to be useful

ill pray and then ill sleep

god wanted to make heaven and the earth is that heaven nowhere in the universe there is so much love life beauty and peace enjoy your stay with the fellow beings

you must worship the self in krishna not krishna as krishna

be a light unto the world and hurt it not seek to build not destroy bring my people home

how

by your shining example seek only godliness speak only in truthfulness act only in love

live the law of love now and forever more give everything require nothing

avoid the mundane

do not accept the unacceptable

teach all who seek to learn of me

make every moment of your life an outpouring of love

use every moment to think the highest thought say the highest word do the highest deed in this glorify your holy self and thus too glorify me

bring peace to the earth by bringing peace to all those whose lives you touch be peace feel and express in every moment your divine connection with the all and with every person place and thing

love does not cost anything kind words and deeds do not cost anything the real beauty of the world is equal for everyone to see it was given by god equally to all without restrictions

everyone was given a beautiful vehicle in which to express love to others feelings are free to express and give to ourselves and each other through our willingness to give and care

what is complicated about this why have we made others feel they have to climb mountains and swim oceans in order to make a difference

all we need to understand my friends is that human life was given equally to us all not partially but in totality

we are not on this planet to ask forgiveness of our deities

we regard god as an airman regards his parachute its there for emergencies but he hopes hell never have to use it

all that is not god is death

think of the patience god has had for you and let it resonate to others if you want a more patient world let patience be your motto

to have faith is to be sure of the things we hope for to be certain of the things we cannot see

this is the secret of life the self lives only by dying finds its identity and its happiness only by selfforgetfulness selfgiving selfsacrifice and agape love

there is only one good definition of god the freedom that allows other freedoms to exist

nature and natures laws lay hid in night

god said let newton be and all was light

do something

with tears streaming down my face i helplessly looked to the sky and yelled to god

god look at this mess look at all this pain and suffering look at all this killing and hate god how could you let this happen why don’t you do something

just then a quiet stillness pacified my heart a feeling of peace i won’t ever forget engulfed my body

and as i looked into my own eyes in the mirror the answer to my own question came back to me…

steve stop asking god to do something god already did something he gave you life now you do something

god abandons only those who abandon themselves and whoever has the courage to shut up his sorrow within his own heart is stronger to fight against it than he who complains

how do you know when youre god when i pray to him i find i am talking to myself

god existed before every religion he exists in spite of all religions

in great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of god both may be and one must be wrong god cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time

god doesnt work on our timetable he has a plan that he will execute perfectly and for the highest greatest good of all and for his ultimate glory

there is only one all pervading god it has only one message  love all encompass all and transcend the limits of the selfish gene

the christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake

the greatest act of faith some days is to simply get up and face another day

restlessness and impatience change nothing except our peace and joy peace does not dwell in outward things but in the heart prepared to wait trustfully and quietly on him who has all things safely in his hands

eskimo if i did not know about god and sin would i go to hell priest no not if you did not know eskimo then why did you tell me

i always wondered why god was supposed to be a father she whispers fathers always want you to measure up to something mothers are the ones who love you unconditionally dont you think

love the animals god has given them the rudiments of thought and joy untroubled

god has in fact written two books not just one of course we are all familiar with the first book he wrote namely scripture but he has written a second book called creation

i may not be where i want to be but im thankful for not being where i used to be

one but many

we are all one

but many

the gods too are fond of a joke

god dances with the outcast

never allow your ego to diminish your ability to listen

god favors men and women who delight in being made worthy of happiness before the happiness itself

i am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of god for the salvation of everyone who believes first for the jew then for the gentile

god himself does not give answers he gives himself

if you should rise from nowhere up to somewhere

from being no one up to being someone

be sure to keep repeating to yourself

you owe it to an arbitrary god

whose mercy to you rather than to others

won’t bear to critical examination

stay unassuming if for lack of license

to wear the uniform of who you are

you should be tempted to make up for it

in a subordinationg look or toe

beware of coming too much to the surface

and using for apparel hat was meant

to be the curtain of the inmost soul

everything smaller than heaven bores us because only heaven is bigger than our hearts

the peace of the celestial city is the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment of god and of one another in god city of god book

where does your security lie is god your refuge your hiding place your stronghold your shepherd your counselor your friend your redeemer your saviour your guide if he is you dont need to search any further for security

the anatomy of conflict

no man is great enough or wise enough for any of us to surrender our destiny to the only way in which anyone can lead us is to restore to us the belief in our own guidance

the soul hardly ever realizes it but whether he is a believer or not his loneliness is really a homesickness for god

god depends on us it is through us that god is achieved

it is impossible to enslave mentally or socially a biblereading people the principles of the bible are the groundwork of human freedom

god is the same even though he has a thousand names it is up to us to select a name for him

were all pieces of the same everchanging puzzle

some connected for mere seconds some connected for life

some connected through knowledge some through belief

the humble sinner will sometimes be interpreted as one of the filthiest in the eyes of man yet immersed in the eyes of god and this is due to the volition of honesty regarding his own corruption

if you place your bet with god you lose nothing even if it turns out that god does not exist but if you place it against god and you are wrong and god does exist you lose everything

the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my shield and the horn of my salvation my stronghold

religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise every expanded prospect

letter to william bradford jr april

the wizard of oz says look inside yourself and find self god says look inside yourself and find the holy spirit the first will get you to kansas

the latter will get you to heaven

take your pick

a sacramentlike marriagemeans living a life better than your natural instincts so that youre modeling god and god never gives up

look i know you meant well creating the world and all but how could you let it get away from you like this how come you couldnt stick with your original idea of paradise peoples lives were a mess

if there was a god id still have both nuts

have patience all things are difficult before they become easy

dreams are tawdry when compared with the leading of god and not worthy of the aura of wonder we usually surround them with god only doeth wonders he does nothing else his hand can work nothing less

where i will find peace other than in oblivion

even though you cant finally grasp me guess what i still want to be known

what you cant forget god cant remember

it is the holy spirits job to convict gods job to judge and my job to love

we tend to be preoccupied by our problems when we have a heightened sense of vulnerability and a diminished sense of power today see each problem as an invitation to prayer

the fact of god is necessary for the fact of man think god away and man has no ground of existence

god created the world in six days on the seventh day he rested on the eighth day he started getting complaints and it hasnt stopped since

i have said that the soul is not more than the body

and i have said that the body is not more than the soul

and nothing not god is greater to one than onesself is

rather he consoled himself with the fact that in the real world when he looked closely into the darkness he might find the presence of a light damaged and bruised but a little light all the same

before you came into my life i believed that god had abandoned me now i know that he has blessed me beyond measure

for all works and things which are either commanded or forbidden by god and thus have been instituted by the

supreme majesty are musts nevertheless no one should be dragged to them or away from them by the hair for i can drive no man to heaven or beat him into it with a club

ive always been spiritual but ive never had a proper context and it took me a while to find the proper context its hard to realize you can have any kind of relationship with god you want and so i now have a punk rock relationship with god

women are delicate creatures fragile gentle made by god to be sheltered from the harshness of this world

god is alive real and wants to heal you in every aspect of your life where you are hurting

it is said that god is always on the side of the big battalions

i am unaware of his plans but i shall never stop believing in them because i cannot fathom them and i prefer to mistrust my own intellectual capacities than his justice

the true story of every person in this world is not the story you see the external story the true story of each person is the journey of his or her heart

there is no other way to determine the difference between the will of god and the crafts of satan jesus is the way the truth and the life the holy spirit of god is the comforter

i cannot encourage any fabrication even for the sake of making people feel good if i were to fabricate consciously and knowingly i would not only be ordaining myself their enemy but also ordaining myself gods enemy

god who is everywhere never leaves us yet he seems sometimes to be present sometimes to be absent if we do not know him well we do not realize that he may be more present to us when he is absent than when he is present

choices will continually be necessary and  let us not forget  possible obedience to god is always possible it is a deadly error to fall into the notion that when feelings are extremely strong we can do nothing but act on them

man approaches god most nearly when he is in one sense least like god for what can be more unlike than fullness and need sovereignty and humility righteousness and penitence limitless power and a cry for help

she was a fool and so am i and so is anyone who thinks he sees what god is doing writes bokonon

i didnt need to understand the hypostatic unity of the trinity i just needed to turn my life over to whoever came up with redwood trees

i stared up at the sky and raised my middle finger just in case god was watching i dont like being spied on

do not fight the thing in detail turn from it look only at your lord sing read work

if you are a christian you are not a citizen of this world trying to get to heaven you are a citizen of heaven making your way through this world

the stone that was rolled before christs tomb might appropriately be called the philosophers stone because its removal gave not only the pharisees but now for  years the philosophers so much to think about

mine was a patchwork god sewn together from bits of rag and ribbon eastern and western pagan and hebrew everything but the kitchen sink and jesus

o lord you have searched me and you know me

the whole war between the atheist and the theist comes down to this the atheist believes a what created the universe the theist believes a who created the universe

it may not always be easy convenient or politically correct to stand for truth and right but it is the right thing to do always

to be convinced in our hearts that we have forgiveness of sins and peace with god by grace alone is the hardest thing

men always makes gods in their own image

we must transcend the illusion that money or power has any bearing on our worthiness as children of god

cynicism is when a small mind and a hurt heart rejects the hope love and truth of a big and caring god

believe what you believe and it will be

believe what others believe and they will consume you

and believe me a good piece of chicken can make anybody believe in the existence of god

a foe to god was never true friend to man

god loves you even on your blackest days and he will always always be there to guide you home all you have to do is look for the light of his love

if we assume that man actually does resemble god then we are forced into the impossible theory that god is a coward an idiot and a bounder

if we cooperate with him in loving obedience god will manifest himself to us and that manifestation will be the difference between a nominal christian life and a life radiant with the light of his face

and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor

look at me making one of your dreams come true you and your norm truck driving around normville

youre practically a god

i regard the afterlife to be a fairy story for people that are afraid of the dark

there can only be two basic loves the love of god unto the forgetfulness of self or the love of self unto the forgetfulness and denial of god

god doesnt bless us just to make us happy he blesses us to make us a blessing

you do not need to work to become spiritual you are spiritual you need only to remember that fact spirit is within you god is within you

imagine that jesus is calling you today he extends a second invitation to accept his fathers love and maybe you answer oh i know that its old hat

did you know that every time you tell me you love me i say thank you

when god takes out the trash dont go digging back through it trust him

i feel the healing

touch my heart

and kiss my soul

shower your head with flowers

and anoint your feet with my tears

for i know i have caused you

so much heartache frustration and despair –

throughout my youthful years

i wish i could give you

the remainder of my life

to add to yours

or simply erase

the lines on your face

and mend all that has been torn

for next to god

you are the fire

that has given light

to the flame in each of my eyes

you are the fountain

that nourished my growth

and from your chalice –

without the wetness of your love

the fragrance of your water

or the trickling sounds of

your voice

if you are able to judge god so easily you certainly can judge the world you must choose two of your children to spend eternity in gods new heavens and new earthand you must choose three of your children to spend eternity in hell

mack i dont want to be the judge

i cant do this

you suppose then that god does this so easily but you cannot

mack i cant i cantcould i go insteadill go in their placecould i do that he fell at her feet crying and begging now please let me go for my childreni am begging you pleaseplease

now you sound like jesusthat is how jesus loves

if the almighty directs our steps weve no need to look back over our shoulders

there’s always a choice that’s god’s way always will be your will is still free do as you will there’s no set of legirons on you but this is what god wants of you

the only legitimate reason that kingship is not attractive to us is because in this age and this world the only kings available are finite and sinful listen to c s lewis describe why he believes in democracy

the question is not whether god broke into the universe as a king he did the question is what kind of king is he what difference would his kingship make for you

sometimes god calms the storm and sometimes he calms his child

the greatest thing a man can do in this world is to make the most possible out of the stuff that has been given him this is success and there is no other

man is a demon man is a god both true

i have no such powers if i did i would be more merciful than god believe me

spirituality is not about being fixed it is about gods being present in the mess of our unfixedness messy spirituality

let our voices be heard i hope they will not be shrill voices but i hope we shall speak with such conviction that those to whom we speak shall know of the strength of our feeling and the sincerity of our efforts

before you realize this truth say the yogis you will always be in despair a notion nicely expressed in this exasperated line from the greek stoic philosopher epictetus you bear god within you poor wretch and know it not

theres no safety outside of god

god is peace bliss beauty and truth focus your energy on that life will be like that

the worse i am the more i need god i cant shut myself out from his mercy that is what it would mean starting a life with you without him

it does not mean that god has failed

we are all butterflies earth is our chrysalis

many spiritfilled authors have exhausted the thesaurus in order to describe god with the glory he deserves his perfect holiness by definition assures us that our words cant contain him isnt it a comfort to worship a god we cannot exaggerate

the sorrow of god lies in our fear of him our fear of life and our fear of ourselves he anguishes over our selfabsorption and selfsufficiency gods sorrow lies in our refusal to approach him when we sinned and failed

the maker of the universe with stars a hundred thousand lightyears apart was interested furious and very personal about it if a small boy played baseball on sunday afternoon

teenagers who do not go to church are adored by god but they dont get to meet some of the people who love god back

if theres a god out there then i would hope he has more important things to attend to than my drinking scotch or eating pork

a friend once said and i found to be truethat everyday people they lie to god tooso what makes you think that they wont lie to you

i think music is what language once aspired to be music allows us to face god on our own terms because it reaches beyond life

i told him i had once lost everything i had too and that i think that can be god’s way of building walls around us to force us to look up at him

if you wish to befriend someone look for a person who loves first god then themselves if they love god they will be able to love their neighbor too

to realize the truth you have to cross the boundaries of all religions and prophets

i know im not god are you dont be silly

god god everybodys god dont be silly

fear is to begin with the end in mind there is no end life is eternal live life knowing that the end was your past and the future is only full of beautiful beginnings through an eternity built around god’s love

i swear to god

god doesn’t come to this part of the house so swear to me liam c

science fiction any scientific acclaim that omits god

they believe themselves lucifers equals cain all these pitiful little gnats but there is only one that we have ever owned to be our superior there is but one greater than us and to him to him we no longer speak

satan is screaming lies over us all day long and god whispers the truth is a still small voice so often the voice we listen to most is the one we hear loudest

in monasteries seminaries retreats and synagogues they fear hell and seek paradise those who know the mysteries of god never let that seed be planted in their souls

fuck you angel fuck you and all gods little prison bitches he slips you some cigarettes and a con job smile and you run off to do his dirty work for him go and scare some sinners no ones listening to you here

the whole time you thought you were waiting on god but the whole time god was waiting on you

where others have not supported you he will support you when you feel discouraged he will be your encouragement where you don’t know he will tell you when the time is right when you feel unloved remember that he has always loved you

you see limitations god sees opportunities you see faults god sees growth you see problems god sees solutions you see limitations god sees possibilities you see life god sees eternity

all gods giants have been weak men who did great things for god because they reackoned on god being with them

the gods have become our diseases

concerned but not consumed

i have always been a firm believer in god and the power of prayer though to be honest my faith has made for alist of questions i definitely want answered after im gone

he hath never failed thee yet

never will his love forget

o fret not thyself nor let

thy heart be troubled

neither let it be afraid

a god that did everything we thought was right and good wouldnt be the creator of the universe he would be our puppet

the goal of prayer is to live all of my life and speak all of my words in the joyful awareness of the presence of god

prayer becomes real when we grasp the reality and goodness of gods constant presence with the real me jesus lived his everyday life in conscious awareness of his father

marriage isnt about winning  its about lasting

bare heights of lonelinessa wilderness whose burning winds sweep over glowing sands what are they to him even there he can refresh us even there he can renew us

god is love and he who abides in love abides in god and god in him

every christian would agree that a mans spiritual health is exactly proportional to his love for god

i had a standing agreement with god id agree to believe in him barely so long as he let me sleep in on sundays

she wasnt a logically reasoning woman but god is good and hearts may count in heaven as high as heads

no matter what the cause god is only as willing as you are

it was a subtle refinement of god to learn greek when he wished to write a book – and that he did not learn it better

all his prayers of the past had been simple concrete requests god give me a bicycle a knife with seven blades a box of oil paints only how how could you say something so indefinite so meaningless as this god let me be loved

blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly nor stands in the path of sinners nor sits in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law he meditates day and night

the saints too had wandering minds the saints too had constantly to recall their constantly wandering mindchild home they became saints because they continued to go after the little wanderer like the good shepherd

if youre reading this i hope god opens incredible doors for your life this year greatness is upon you you must believe it though

any patch of sunlight in a wood will show you something about the sun which you could never get from reading books on astronomy these pure and spontaneous pleasures are ‘patches of godlight’ in the woods of our experience

i decided i would fill the emptiness in me with god and with paint

the bible is the greatest of all books to study it is the noblest of all pursuits to understand it the highest of all goals

it may be a species of impudence to think that the way you understand god is the way god is

the world is charged with the grandeur of god

faith in god is an opening up a letting go a deep trust a free act of love  but sometimes it was so hard to love

let people embrace their elected god or let them create one if they feel inspired in case some want to share it may be fun but if they don’t fancy the concept they should be free to recant is heaven a place in the sky

the body is wiser than its inhabitants the body is the soul the body is god’s messenger

we are beautiful because we are sons and daughters of god not because we look a certain way

anything beyond the limits and grasp of the human mind is either illusion or futility and because your god having to be one or the other of the two in the first instance i should be mad to believe in him and in the second a fool

god didn’t give fear a body god gave love a body

god made you the way he wanted you to be and he does not make mistakes he has a plan for your life that is much bigger than you can imagine

omnipotentbenevolent simply means that god is allpowerful and wellmeaning

i understand the concept its just    there seems to be a contradiction

yes the contradiction is pain mans starvation war sickness

the camerlengo frowned would he

do you have children lieutenant

chartrand flushed no signore

imagine you had an eightyearold son    would you love him

would you let him skateboard

chartrand did a double take the camerlengo always seemed oddly in touch for a clergyman yeah i guess chartrand said sure id let him skateboard but id tell him to be careful

so as this childs father you would give him some basic good advice and then let him go off and make his own mistakes

i wouldnt run behind him and mollycoddle him if thats what you mean

but what if he fell and skinned his knee

he would learn to be more careful

the camerlengo smiled so although you have the power to interfere and prevent your childs pain you would choose to show your love by letting him learn his own lessons

of course pain is part of growing up its how we learn

the camerlengo nodded exactly

god is not interested in your art but your heart

charity even for one person does not make sense except in terms of an effort to love all creation in response to the creators love for it

i want to be with god all the time but i dont want to be a monk or totally give up worldly pleasures i guess what i want to learn is how to live in this world and enjoy its delights but also devote myself to god

i dont know whether i believe in god or not i think really im some kind of a buddhist but the essential thing is to put oneself in a frame of mind which is close to that of prayer

i wonder sometimes what the memory of god looks like is it a palace of infinite rooms a chest of many jeweled objects a long lonely landscape where each tree recalls an eon each pebble the life of a man where do i live in the memory of god

i dont think it is a good mental health practice to fantasize that you know the infinite thoughts of imaginary entities

if it’s not one god it’s another allah or oil jesus or jewels lenin or lust

it is impossible to see how good work might be accomplished by people who think that our life in this world either signifies nothing or has only a negative significance

work connects us both to creation and to eternity pg  christianity and the survival of creation

he had discovered that there was not just one god but many and some were more than cruel — they were insane and that changed all cruelty after all was understandable with insanity however there was no arguing

he was a wise man who invented god

god hides the fires of hell within paradise

but no matter how much evil i see i think it’s important for everyone to understand that there is much more light than darkness

enjoy the world

you and i were created by god to be so much more than normal…following the crowd is not a winning approach to life in the end it’s a loser’s game because we never become who god created us to be by trying to be like everybody else

the prophets isaiah and ezekiel dined with me and i asked them how they dared so roundly to assert that god spoke to them and whether they did not think at the time that they would be misunderstood  so be the cause of imposition

i testify that he is utterly incomparable in what he is what he knows what he has accomplished and what he has experienced yet movingly he calls us his friends

god leads us god will do the right thing at the right time and what a difference that makes

to love someone is to desire and work toward their becoming the best version of themselves the one person in all the universe who can do this perfectly for you is god

wonder what day god created the egg how should we know we should not question our stay on earth is not for long let us rejoice and believe and give thanks eat a egg

happiness is inseparably connected with decent clean behavior

no one can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and money

supposing that originally there was nothing but one creator how could ordinary binary sexual relations come into being

its time we capture our imaginations for christ

define the word exist and youll know whether god exists

christianity is not about how much faith you have its about who your faith is in

could there be any doubt that the jews would seek to harm the son of god again knowing that his body was now readily accessible in the form of defenseless crackers

if theres one thing ive learned its that god is a very creative author and he writes a different story for every person no two lives or stories alike

tell me im a sinner i got news for you

i spoke to god this morning and he dont like you

dont you try and teach me no original sin

i dont need your pity for the shape im in

far better it is for you to say i am a sinner than to say i have no need of religion the empty can be filled but the selfintoxicated have no room for god

never doubt god in the darkness what he has given us in the light

you must know that you are worth much to me whether you accomplish anything or not even if you are rejected in the worlds eyes you are valuable to me

god made everything out of nothing but the nothingness shows through

i think god is a callous bitch not making me a lesbian im deeply disappointed by my sexual interest in men

if god hadnt rested on sunday he would have had time to finish the world

a bird does not fall in air

in the fire of creation

god doesnt vanish

the fire brightens

each creature god made

must live in its own true nature

how could i resist my nature

that lives for oneness with god

dont think you can frighten me by telling me that i am alone france is alone god is alone and the loneliness of god is his strength

the fear of god reigning in the heart is the beauty of the soul

to be a god can ultimately become boring and degrading thered be reason enough for the invention of free will a god might wish to escape into sleep and be alive only in the unconscious projections of his dreamcreatures

god is the reason i’m surviving but he’s sure used you in my life wonderfully i love you

only the hopeless love god

if you could really see that tree over there merlin said you would be so astounded that youd fall over

really but why asked arthur its just a tree

no merlin said its just a tree in your mind to another mind it is an expression of infinite spirit and beauty in gods mind it is a dear child sweeter than anything you can imagine

these are the three stages of enlightenment the three glimpses of satori

the first stage enlightenment

a glimpse of the whole

the first stage of enlightenment is short glimpse from faraway of the whole it is a short glimpse of being

there is a gap a silence and emptiness where there is not thought between you and existence

you and existence meet and merge for a moment

and for the first time the seed the thirst and longing for enlightenment the meeting between you and existence will grow in your heart

the second stage of enlightenment

silence relaxation togetherness inner being

the second stage of enlightenment is a new order a harmony from within which comes from the inner being it is the quality of freedom

the inner chaos has disappeared and a new silence relaxation and togetherness has arisen

your own wisdom from within has arisen

a subtle ego is still present in the second stage of enlightenment

the hindus has three names for the ego

ahamkar which is the ordinary ego

asmita which is the quality of amness of no ego it is a very silent ego not aggreessive but it is still a subtle ego

atma the third word is atma when the amness is also lost this is what buddha callas noself pure being

in the second stage of enlightenment you become capable of being in the inner being in the gap in the meditative quality within in the silence and emptiness

for hours for days you can remain in the gap in utter aloneness in god

still you need effort to remain in the gap and if you drop the effort the gap will disappear

love meditation and prayer becomes the way to increase the effort in the search for god

then the second stage becomes a more conscious effort now you know the way you now the direction

the third stage of enlightenment

ocean wholeness noself pure being

at the third stage of enlightenment at the third step of satori our individual river flowing silently suddenly reaches to the ocean and becomes one with the ocean

at the third satori the ego is lost and there is atma pure being you are but without any boundaries the river has become the ocean the whole

it has become a vast emptiness just like the pure sky

the third stage of enlightenment happens when you have become capable of finding the inner being the meditative quality within the gap the inner silence and emptiness so that it becomes a natural quality

you can find the gap whenever you want

this is what tantra callas mahamudra the great orgasm what buddha calls nirvana what lao tzu calls tao and what jesus calls the kingdom of god

you have found the door to god

you have come home

gentleness is strength under control it is the ability to stay calm no matter what happens

when we lift our hands in praise and worship we break spiritual jars of perfume over jesus the fragrance of our praise fills the whole earth and touches the heart of god

those who are afraid of freedom are those who cannot trust us to live in them trying to keep the law is actually a declaration of independence a way of keeping control

open your eyes that you might see that all things are possible through you with gods help

i say to myself who are you to measure infinite power

god does not patch up the old life

or make certain repairs on the old life

he gives a new life through the new birth

loss is only temporary when you believe in god

is anything too hard for the lord genesis

in gods eyes walking on water is no more miraculous than the ability of hemoglobin to bond with oxygen inside a red blood corpuscle

faith in its most correct form never removes responsibility it removes fear of responsibility the results are complete opposites with the greater saying gods will is my delight

im only a tool beloved not your savior

once i was free in the shackles of sin

free to be tempted just bound to give in

free to be captive to any desire

free to eternally burn in hell’s fire

‘til someone bought me and called me his slave

bound by commands i am free to obey

captive by beauty i’m free to adore

sentenced to sit at his feet evermore

for in paris whenever god puts a pretty woman there the streets the devil in reply immediately puts a fool to keep her

our identity rests in gods relentless tenderness for us revealed in jesus christ

common sense is no match for the voice of god

philosophers can debate the meaning of life but you need a lord who can declare the meaning of life

we live in a world that is beyond our control and life is in a constant flux of change so we have a decision to make keep trying to control a storm that is not going to go away or start learning how to live within the rain

one must love god first and only then can one love ones closest of kin and neighbors we must not be idols to one another for such is not the will of god

your current circumstances are part of your redemption story he is writing

as fallible humans we usually slip too far over one edge or the other  all wrath and judgment or all grace and love

o child of god be more careful to keep the way of the lord more concentrated in heart in seeking his glory and you will see the lovingkindness and the tender mercy of the lord in your life

your angel cannot protect you against that which neither god nor the devil had made

i see the glass half full and thank god for what i have

but what if youre wrong

what if theres more

what if theres hope you never dreamed of hoping for

what if you jump

and just close your eyes

what if the arms that catch you catch you by surprise

what if hes more than enough

what if its love

now he haunts me seldom some fierce umbilical is broken

i live with my own fragile hopes and sudden rising despair

now i do not weep for my sins i have learned to love them

and to know that they are the wounds that make love real

his face illudes me his voice with its pity does not ring in my ear

his maxims memorized in boyhood do not make fruitless and pointless my experience

i walk alone but not so terrified as when he held my hand

i do not splash in the blood of his son

nor hear the crunch of nails or thorns piercing protesting flesh

i am a boy againi whose boyhood was turned to manhood in a brutal myth

now wine is only wine with drops that do not taste of blood

the bread i eat has too much pride for transubstantiation

i tooand together the bread and i embrace

each grateful to be what we are each loving from our own reality

because your steadfast love is better than life my lips will praise you

god is so immense that if he were too visible people would give forced compliance without expressing their heart so god made it possible in enormous love for us to live as if he were not there

true happiness is not found in any other reward than that of being united with god if i seek some other reward besides god himself i may get my reward but i cannot be happy

when i see god i see beauty i see love i see joy i see peace and i see you god loves us let us love one another

he flashed the warmest smile id ever seen and my heart felt comforted maybe dj saw my insecurities my fears maybe he knew god still had a lot of work to do in my life before id be good girlfriend material

or maybe just maybe he saw beyond all that and simply wanted to flirt with the wedding coordinator instead of rehearse for the big night

i did my best to relaxand let him

art is a collaboration between god and the artist and the less the artist does the better

on the subject of who is to blame for our disunity  the easy conclusion that

the devil is at work trying to destroy the church is true but itʼs not the whole story of

course the enemy is at work doing that but closer examination shows that much of

the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the church itselfon believers in godand

how our own devilish deeds have alienated other followers of god sadly weʼve done

the devilʼs work for him

theres a lot of pride involved in my refusal to believe in god

never forget that there are only two philosophies to rule your life the one of the cross which starts with the fast and ends with the feast the other of satan which starts with the feast and ends with the headache

and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat

my lack of faith in god is not a dilapidated house

it does not need to be razed to the ground or burned down to cinders

i refuse to be the wounded woman on a cross

that you crucify with your disapproval like nails

i will only be the woman who believes in thunderstorms

the same way lightning loves the tops of trees it strikes

every time it gets tired of being pent up in an unforgiving sky

the only difference is that i believe these are natural weather phenomenons

not god’s belly rumbling or synapses firing

when my doorway is filled with groups of people

i will be the martyr who steps aside to let the arrows

crack through the plaster in my wall instead of piercing my chest

this is not a eulogy to the believer i could have been

this is a battle cry to the believer i always have been

after old nights spent drowning in despair believer

in love as an entire language instead of a single word

just because my beliefs align themselves on a different spectrum

does not mean they are the wrong wavelength or color

and even though i think the universe was created by the big bang

instead of a god with magic dust shooting from his fingertips

my universe does not contain fewer stars

i want to help you to grow as beautiful as god meant you to be when he thought of you first

but i dont understand god i dont understand how he could see the way people treat one another and not chalk up the whole human race as a bad idea

on my honor i will do my best

to do my duty to god and my country

if god were not only to hear our prayers as he does ever and always but to answer them as we want them answered he would not be god our saviour but the ministering genius of our destruction

god wasnt love couldnt be love because for me love was a corpse

you know how it goes

at some point in your life

you fell in love with someone

and had a glimpse of god

then you abandoned life and lover

and started celebrating

your love for god

all was in gods plan and he had to accept even as he didnt understand

one by one these disciples would infect the nations with grace it wasnt a call to take the sword or the throne and force the world to bow rather they were to live the contagious love of god to woo the nations into a new future

in moments of prayer people tend to pose as a critic and point out percieved flaws in gods art

you are not limited to this body to this mind or to this reality—you are a limitless ocean of consciousness imbued with infinite potential you are existence itself

god is an hypothesis and as such stands in need of proof the onus probandi rests on the theist

was it scripted by god or i am playing with my life

let my worship be within the heart that rejoices

for behold all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals

therefore let there be beauty and strength

power and compassion honor and humility

mirth and reverence within you

i know there is a god because in rwanda i shook hands with the devil i have seen him i have smelled him and i have touched him i know the devil exists and therefore i know there is a god

god created heaven on earth but man created hell

this is one reason people need to believe in god—because we want someone to know us truly all the way through even the worst of us

it dont matter if you believe in god nick he believes in you

he is not apprehended by reason but by life

in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth    then he said let there be light which means he made the entire universe in the dark how fucking good is that hes brilliant

one must pray first but afterwards one must help oneself god does not care for cowards

in the end what will you fight for what got there first what got there last or what has been there all along

even when you dont see him working hes busy working on your behalf forever grateful for gods grace

in a wellfunctioning democracy the state constitution is considered more important than gods holy book whichever holy book that may be and god matters only in your private life

you are a child of mine

born of my own design

and you bear the hard of life

no matter where you go

oh you will always know

that youve been made free in christ

and you are a child of mine

when it comes to god we cant run out of second chancesonly time

and if there is no god

you act as if there is and its the same thing

these thoughts are depressing i know they are depressing

i wish i was more cheerful it is more pleasant

also it is a duty we should smile as well as submitting

to the purpose of one above who is experimenting

with various mixtures of human character which goes best

all is interesting for him it is exciting but not for us

there i go again smile smile and get some work to do

then you will be practically unconscious without positively having to go

every word every image used for god is a distortion more than a description

coincidence is gods way of being anonymous

you got a god dont make no difference if you don know what he looks like

it is only through us that god lives when we abandon him he dies

even now there are still days so beautiful i almost believe in god

do not forget do not ever forget that you have promised me to use the money to make yourself an honest man

valjean who did not recall having made any promise was silent the bishop had spoken the words slowly and deliberately he concluded with a solemn emphasis

jean valjean my brother you no longer belong to what is evil but to what is good i have bought your soul to save it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition and i give it to god

if in my life i fail completely to heed others solely out of a desire to be devout and to perform my religious duties then my relationship with god will also grow arid it becomes merely proper but loveless

may the god who gives endurance and encouragement

give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow

christ jesus so that with one heart and mouth you may

glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ

god is dead and i am his replacement

the great question that will be with us throughout this entire book what did jesus actually bring if not world peace universal prosperity and a better world what has he brought

theres no god higher than truth

what is the world what is it for

assess it like that and when youre done find an ant and have him assess the cathedrals of europe

in seven days god had created the earth in a single day mankind had turned it upside down

gods will is what we would choose if we knew what god knows

with god all things are possible

cynicism places the cynic at the center seat of judgement with the self appointed authority to criticize and condemn

break my heart for what breaks yours

everything i am for your kingdoms cause

as i walk from earth into eternity

with god all things are possible a

the whole universe is sum up in the human being devil is not a monster waiting to trap us he is a voice inside look for your devil in yourself not in the others

don’t forget that the one who knows his devil knows his god

i receive thee ransom of my soul for love of thee have i studied and kept vigil toiled preached and taught…

i saw the spiders marching through the air

swimming from tree to tree that mildewed day

in latter august when the hay

came creaking to the barn but where

the wind is westerly

where gnarled november makes the spiders fly

into the apparitions of the sky

they purpose nothing but their ease and die

urgently beating east to sunrise and the sea

the world looks like something god had just imaged for his own pleasure doesnt it

the sorrows god sent us brought comfort and strength with them while the sorrows we brought on ourselves through folly or wickedness were by far the hardest to bear

then hwin though shaking all over gave a strange little neigh and trotted across to the lion

please she said youre so beautiful you may eat me if you like id sooner be eaten by you than fed by anyone else

the mind of god is a mystery and none can understand it

if i convert its because its better that a believer dies than that an atheist does

i have realized that whatever good comes to me comes from god whatever bad comes to me god has allowed it and i choose to be thankful for both

easily mistaken it is not about a love for adversity it is about knowing a strength and a faith so great that adversity in all its adverse manifestations hardly even exists

to be a child means to owe ones existence to another and even in our adult life we never quite reach the point where we no longer have to give thanks for being the person we are

embedded in the larger story of redemption is a principle we must not miss god uses ordinary people to do extraordinary things in the lives of others

you dont have to stop thinking and asking questions to believe in god child if hed wanted a flock of eight billion sheep he wouldnt have given us opposable thumbs much less free will

two or three angels

came near to the earth

they saw a fat church

came and went in continually

and the angels were puzzled

to know why the people went thus

and why they stayed so long within

remember he wants your fellowship and he has done everything possible to make it a reality he has forgiven your sins at the cost of his own dear son he has given you his word and the priceless privilege of prayer and worship

you will be at your best forever even now you have good moments occasional glimpses of your heavenly self when you change your babys diaper forgive your bosss temper tolerate your spouses moodiness you display traces of saintliness

the day came when she discovered sex sensuality and literature she said i submit let my life be henceforth ruled by poetry let me reign as the queen of my dreams until i become nothing less than the heroine of god

when lincoln was asked if god was on the union’s side lincoln’s unvarying response was that what was really important was whether they were on god’s side

no one can sum up all god is able to accomplish through one solitary life wholly yielded adjusted and obedient to him

great minds think alike because a greater mind is thinking through them

if i were to construct a god i would furnish him with some way and qualities and characteristics which the present lacks

can a mortal ask questions which god finds unanswerable quite easily i should think all nonsense questions are unanswerable

god gave us the gift of life it is up to us to give ourselves the gift of living well

what comes when it comes will be what it is

prayers are to men as dolls are to children

what gave you this idea of an imperfect god

i dont know it seems quite feasible to me that is the only god i could imagine believing in a god whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purposea god who simply is

for when we cease to worship god we do not worship nothing we worship anything

hating skin color is contempt for gods divine creative imagination honoring it is appreciation for conscious beautifulloveinspired diversity

why should i wish to see god better than this day

i see something of god each hour of the twentyfour and each moment then

in the faces of men and women i see god and in my own face in the glass

i find letters from god dropped in the street and every one is signed by gods name

and i leave them where they are

for i know that others will punctually come forever and ever

him

there is no one who takes care of us as lovingly as our mother does she is our living god

nowhere in the bible however do we find god distinguishing between levels of sin god doesnt share our rating system to him all sin is equally evil and all sinners are equally lovable

often im asked next what do you really think

i say i just told you what i really think

yes but whats your gut feeling

earthseed the books of the living

i hear and behold god in every object yet understand god not in the least

nor do i understand who there can be more wonderful than myself

things that look impossible suddenly seem a lot better once you get god on board

we seek god so earnestly eliav reflected not to find him but to discover ourselves

god is the composer you are the song

god spoke to you by so many voices but you would not hear

what the new mate sports car or unexpected check could never do christ says i can youll love how he achieves it he reconnects your soul with god

it is closer to the truth to say that god is crazy than that god is reasonable i suspect god merely smiles when someone calls him crazy but shakes his head and frowns when someone calls him reasonable

we may be helpless to stop bad things from happening but perhaps god leaves us signs and road maps to help us recover and reconnect provided we know where to look

the more i know about god i am convinced he likes to read books and authors are his librarians every soul is a story waiting to be read

man in his spiritual pride has exchanged god’s method of selfdenial for satan’s plan of self–improvement

enlightenment is at the source of everything from it flows our intuition and our creative energy it is the delta of the human spirit  what we innately seek to return to as we find ourselves lost in this world

that god is in truth the sort of bloodthirsty paranoid who would rend to bits fortytwo children for the crime of sassing one of his priests dont ask me about the front offices policies i just work here

gods should be iridescent like the rainbow in the storm man creates a god in his own image and the gods grow old along with the men that made them but the godstuff roars eternally like the sea with too vast a sound to be heard

he uses our past to positively affect our present and secure our future

god created me—and you—to live with a single allembracing alltransforming passion—namely a passion to glorify god by enjoying and displaying his supreme excellence in all the spheres of life

in silence the three of them looked at the sunset and thought about god

glory be to him who changes others and remains himself unchanged

i don’t want to be an anti against anybody i simply want to be the builder of a great affirmation the affirmation of godwho loves us and who wants to save us

can i tell you that in my eyes not even god would be good enough to command you

prayer is an acknowledgment that our need of gods help is not partial but total

newspapers are the bibles of worldlings

how diligently they read them

here they find their law and profits

their judges and chronicles

their epistles and revelations

funny i still cant believe in god

does that matter nowhe believes in you

if we’re lucky god blesses us with a few folks who are willing to look beyond the flaws and see the person we try so hard to hide and if we’re blessed we find someone who’ll love us anyway

hed gone to church for forty years and was only getting worse it seemed like this should tell god something

lincoln grew immeasurably as he came to think of himself as an instrument of god’s will

the earth is gods pinball machine and each quake tidal wave flash flood and volcanic eruption is the result of a tilt that occurs when god cheating tries to win free games

your dream will challenge prod and haunt you until you surrender to its call

while humans play god dogs learn from their masters

of course the cat will growl and spit at the operator and bite him if she can but the real question is whether he is a vet or a vivisector

i suspect youre thinking of pascal finkler said finallyonly he said the opposite he said you might as well wager on god because that way even if he doesnt exist youve nothing to lose whereas if you wager against god and he does exist

youre in the shit

if you want to love god love the lessfortunate one if you want to see god look through the eyes of a hungry child

if i can put one touch of rosy sunset into the life of any man or woman i shall feel that i have worked with god

i know that what you call god really exists but not in the form you think god is primal cosmic energy the love in your body your integrity and your perception of the nature in you and outside of you

god hold us to that which drew us first when the cross was the attraction and we wanted nothing else

quoting from thomas merton

dialogues with silence

the lord works through deeply flawed people since he made so few of the other kind

if god did not exist he would have to be invented but all nature cries aloud that he does exist that there is a supreme intelligence an immense power an admirable order and everything teaches us our own dependence on it

if i were omnipotent and omnibenevolent i wouldnt be so damn ineffable

god and religion before every thing dante cried god and religion before the world

mr casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on the table with a crash

very well then he shouted hoarsely if it comes to that no god for ireland

john john cried mr dedalus seizing his guest by the coat sleeve

dante stared across the table her cheeks shaking mr casey struggled up from his chair and bent across the table towards her scraping the air from before his eyes with one hand as though he were tearing aside a cobweb

no god for ireland he cried we have had too much god in ireland away with god

when my people search for a name to give to the truth we feel at those moments we call it god and when we capture that understanding in timeless poetry we call it praying

ivan hold your tongue or ill kill you

ivan sat with his eyes on the floor and his hands pressed to his ears but he began trembling all over the voice continued

i suddenly saw that all the time it was not i who had been seeking god but god who had been seeking me i had made myself the centre of my own existence and had my back turned to god

the reasoning is classic in its clarity if god does not exist kirilov is god if god does not exist kirilov must kill himself kirilov must therefore kill himself to become god that logic is absurd but it is what is needed

god is a circle whose center is everywhere and its circumference nowhere

you can safely assume youve created god in your own image when it turns out that god hates all the same people you do

the soul may ask god for anything and never fail

light of god gives birth to all stars

whether our days trip along like the angels mounting on jacobs ladder to heaven or grind along like the wagons that joseph sent for jacob they are in each case ordered by gods mercy

god has chosen to save the world through the cross through the shameful and

powerless death of the crucified messiah if that shocking event is the

revelation of the deepest truth about the character of god then our whole way

of seeing the world is turned upside down… all values are transformed… god

refuses to play games of power and prestige on human terms

i didnt exist at creation

i didnt exist at the flood

and i wont be around for salvation

to sort out the sheep from the cud

or whatever the phrase is the fact is

im a crude existential malpractice

and you are a diet of worms

we are here in a wood of little beeches

and the leaves are like black lace

against a sky of nacre

across the moon

it is in this wise that god speaketh unto me

he layeth hands of healing upon my flesh

stilling it in an eternal peace

until my soul reaches out myriad and infinite hands

toward him

and is eased of its hunger

and i know that this passes

this implacable fury and torment of men

as a thing insensate and vain

and the stillness hath said unto me

over the tumult of sounds and shaken flame

out of the terrible beauty of wrath

i alone am eternal

across the moon

gods will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built so pray for that

her faith in a loving and forgiving god is strong but she worships laughter

all things therefore are charged with love are charged with god and if we knew how to touch them give off sparks and take fire yield drops and flow ring and tell of him

if excitement is a mechanism our creator uses for his own amusement love is something that belongs to us alone and enables us to flee the creator love is our freedom love lies beyond es muss sein

god is represented as infinite eternal incomprehensible he is contained under every predicate in non that the logic of ignorance could fabricate

with adequate planning passion and perseverance you can achieve the godgiven goals

the golden eternity is

they had not yet attained the stupefying boredom of omnipotence their experiments did not always succeed

i invite all brats to throw their cookies at the baker’s head if they’re not sweet winos to chuck their wine if it’s bad the dying to shuck their souls when they croak and men to throw their existence in god’s face when it’s bitter

the commandment of love is only possible because it is more than a requirement love can be commanded because it has first been given

the lord replied the years when you have seen only one set of footprints my child is when i carried you

how would this world be if there was not god the answer is simple it would become itself god

faith in god is optional but faith in the self – in the spirit within is imperative

whenever you stand up

for your conscience

be prepared to be hated

by the wicked

but never ever

let that scare you

for whenever you

stand up for god

by him

you are loved

it has been said that we can know god only in so far as we can become god

imagine there is no god there is no heaven or hell there is only your son and his son and his son and the world you leave for them

the tenure of human positions no matter how highly exalted will eventually come to an end only gods tenure is eternal

our problems sometimes show the degree of our relationship with god

god cares only for what is his busies himself with only himself thinks only of himself and has only himself before his eyeshe serves no higher person and satisfies only himself his cause isa purely egoistic cause

and in the soil

of his being

a soul is planted

bearing the fruits

of his masterpiece

he who stands by his heart has god in him our conscience is what unites us with god

all true believers have good reasons for disbelieving in every god except their own said birbal and so it is they who between them give me all the reasons for believing in none

nobody can tell what is right and what is wrong what is righteous and what is evil even if there is a god and i had his teachings right before me i would think it through and decide if that was right or wrong myself

if i could take a bite of the whole world

and feel it on my palate

i’d be more happy for a minute or so

but i don’t always want to be happy

sometimes you have to be

unhappy to be natural

not every day is sunny

when there’s been no rain for a while you pray for it to come

so i take unhappiness with happiness

naturally like someone who doesn’t find it strange

that there are mountains and plains

and that there are cliffs and grass

what you need is to be natural and calm

in happiness and in unhappiness

to feel like someone seeing

to think like someone walking

and when it’s time to die remember the day dies

and the sunset is beautiful and the endless night is beautiful

that’s how it is and that’s how it should be

the man stopped talking and was looking at the sunset

but what does someone who hates and loves want with a sunset

tough times dont define you they refine you ‪

never put yourself in a position to be made an example of

decision decides destiny what god wants you to become is the positive person you decide to become when led by gods spirit

god is not willing to do everything and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us

any person who with all the sincerity of heart is in search for god on land or in the sea is worthy of respect

live you say in the present

live only in the present

but i don’t want the present i want reality

i want things that exist not time that measures them

what is the present

it’s something relative to the past and the future

it’s a thing that exists in virtue of other things existing

i only want reality things without the present

i don’t want to include time in my scheme

i don’t want to think about things as present i want to think of them as things

i don’t want to separate them from themselves treating them as present

i shouldn’t even treat them as real

i should treat them as nothing

i should see them only see them

see them till i can’t think about them

see them without time without space

to see dispensing with everything but what you see

and this is the science of seeing which isn’t a science

children understood at a very young age that doing nothing was an expression of power doing nothing was a choice swollen with omnipotence it was in fact godly

god loves us but the devil takes an interest

the love of christ is always there and unchanging no matter what we do but it is when we are obedient that we actually begin to feel it

when the world caves in

still my hope will cling

to your promise

where my courage ends

let my heart find strength

in your presence

we need a bigger estimation of god and a smaller estimation of sin

even a god finds it hard to love and be wise at the same time

i wonder either their god has turned old sick or died because even the religious people no more believe in shit

there are always consequences to wrong choices

no matter what i feel i hold the assurance that god never leaves me

the lord likes small things best especially those done with love

i pray that i am never so foolishly naive or roguishly pompous to think that i can be the captain of my own ship for if god is not at the helm my ship will soon be at the bottom

im always talking to god about whether or not he exists  thats how i know im a theist

leonora penderton feared neither man beast nor the devil god she had never known

religion is based on the idea that god is an imbecile

many of the most powerful things in life are not tangible all it takes is for you to close your eyes to see

dear god i am only what you made me and i appreciate everything that you gave me but like i dont want to do it any more sort of lost sight of what im doing it for

faithfulness imparts gods reason for all circumstances no matter what the world says losing is no longer an option

never compare your love story to those you watch in movies theyre written by scriptwriters yours is written by god

if you choose not to talk

if the universe does consist of a battle between the devil and god the final analysis should conclude that religion would have been the devil’s most brilliant move and science god’s

ingratitude to god does not rely only on our refusal to give the verbal thanksgiving due to him but also recides in our inability to appreciate his gifts and potentials in us by leaving them untapped

go ahead god you fat filthy motherfucker lightningbolt my ass into oblivion if youre so tough

caring for the poor resting on the sabbath showing hospitality and keeping the home—these are important things that can lead us to god but god is not contained in them

dont ever be discouraged with yourself because you have not arrived at success but instead be pleased that you are pressing toward it

realize this – your anger with god does not drive a wedge between you and him it is your silence that drives the wedge  prodigal life

i imagined i was god for a millisecond

and became speechless for a long time

loving someone is waking up a little bit earlier than they do so you can pray for their day

we do not need such things to help us to see god i countered we have his word and that is

jesus said enter into my rest and let god do what he does best

i can only imagine how happy life would be if we could stay so grounded in our faith that we would never waver in our positive attitudes

keep on the watch and pray

peace for israel he said

is that possible i drew closer

yes if we have peace with god first

might something god only has

it is said that men may not be the dreams of the god but rather that the gods are the dreams of men

theres no need to curse god if youre an ugly duckling he chooses those strong enough to endure it so that they can guide others whove felt the same

dazzles the darkness in my heart

and breaks apart the dusky clouds of night

the end of all is hinted in the start

when we are born we bear the seeds of blight

around us life  death are torn apart

yet a great ring of pure and endless light

dazzles the darkness in my heart

it lights the world to my delight

infinity is present in each part

a loving smile contains all art

the motes of starlight spark  dart

infinity is present in each part

and a great ring of pure and endless light

dazzles the darkness in my heart

you can see god from anywhere if your mind is set to love and obey him

the man who counts on the aid of a god deserves the help he doesnt get

i experience religious dread whenever i find myself thinking that i know the limits of god’s grace since i am utterly certain it exceeds any imagination a human being might have of it god does after all so love the world

i believe in a god of scandalous grace i have pledged allegiance to a king who loved evildoers so much he died for them teaching us that there is something worth dying for but nothing worth killing for

in gods eyes a man who teaches one truth and nothing else is more righteous than a man who teaches a million truths and one lie

what do we find god doing about this business of sin and evilgod did not abolish the fact of evil he transformed it he did not stop the crucifixion he rose from the dead

it makes me happier more secure to think that i do not have to plan and manage everything for myself that i am only a sword made sharp to smite the unclean forces an enchanted sword to cleave and disperse them

grant o lord that i may not break as i strike let me not fall from thy hand

but it aint easy trying to do without god even if you know he aint there trying to do without him is a strain

only god may be adored because only god is unlimited goodness truth and beauty and thus only god deserves unlimited love

as we grow in the knowledge of gods holiness even though we are growing in the practice of holiness it seems the gap between our knowledge and our practice always gets wider this is the holy spirits way of drawing us to more and more holiness

if that type of bad god did exist then we could go on living in good health if we could push the responsibility for our misery onto god then we would have that much more peace of mind wouldnt we

the god that we commonly know may be less sinister than the true god that we dont know for sure

acedia is sorrow so complete that the flesh pervails completely over the spirit you dont just turn your back on the world you turn your back on god you dont care and you dont care that you dont care

it sounds as if youd like to be god

all what we think and know is an illusion nothing exists everything is an opinion

there is no point of adventure if you have known about everything

i wonder how god deals with the situation considering the boredom

i do not know the answers to lifes hard questions but i do know the one who knows them and thats sufficientfor now

the lord doesnt want anybody in his house who has to be dragged there

who that prohibits two people who have different views about god to love each other

creativity is the natural order of life life is energy pure creative energy

there is an underlying indwelling creative force infusing all of life  including ourselves

when we open ourselves to our creativity we open ourselves to the creators creativity within us and our lives

we are ourselves creations and we in turn are meant to continue creativity by being creative ourselves

creativity is gods gift to us using our creativity is our gift back to god

the refusal to be creative is selfwill and is counter to our true nature

when we open ourselves to exploring our creativity we open ourselves to god good orderly direction

as we open our creative channel to the creator many gentle but powerful changes are to be expected

it is safe to open ourselves up to greater and greater creativity

our creative dreams and yearnings come from a divine source as we move toward our dreams we move toward our divinity

god is found in the collection of many   rather than in the one

but god knows best i concluded

if grace belongs to god there are those who say that luck belongs to the devil and that he looks after his own

these infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an omnipotent being how these madmen

give themselves away the real god taketh heed lest a sparrow fall but the god created from human vanity sees

no difference between an eagle and a sparrow

man’s glory lies not lincoln thought in ‘his goodness’ for this is often nonexistent he derives glory instead from his being made in the image of the living god

im here to tell you there aint much forgiveness in that oldtime religion that particular savior was a mean son of a bitch if you sinned honey he was going to get you no doubt about it

i call them sacred echoes because i noticed that throughout my relationships daily life and study the same scripturally sound idea or phrase or word will keep reappearing until i can no longer avoid its presence the sacred echo

we must go out to pure life pure truth pure love and that is the definition of god he is the ultimate goal of life from him we came and in him alone do we find our peace

the promise of a dreamer’s future will always remain greater than their present ability god will always give them dreams that are further along than their current level of maturity

praise be to god who has so disposed matters that pleasant literary anecdotes may serve as an instrument for the polishing of wits and the cleansing of rust from our hearts

away with them away we should not believe fairy stories if we wish to be good think of them as persons from the fairy wood

god deposits a dream of what we can be for him a dream that acts as our internal honing device

and like an echo god often uses the repetitive events and themes in daily life to get my attention and draw me closer to himself  the sacred echo

the official was bending over his desk staring at the sergeant

may i ask you a question

have you ever thought you were christ

i cant say that i have but i have considered that god was good to me to let me find what i was looking for if thats what you mean

god is only where you let him in

theology philosophy metaphysics and quantum physics are merely ways for god to have his smart people believe in him

to put it another way pain is gods megaphone to rouse a deaf world why must it be pain why cant he rouse us more gently with violins or laughter because the dream from which we must be wakened is the dream that all is well

depend on it gods work done in gods way will never lack gods supply he is too wise a god to frustrate his purposes for lack of funds and he can just as easily supply them ahead of time as afterwards and he much prefers doing so

different creeds are but different paths to reach the same god

what is this thing called life i believe

that the earth and the stars too and the whole glittering universe and rocks on the mountains have life

only we do not call it soi speak of the life

that oxidizes fats and proteins and carbo

hydrates to live on and from that chemical energy

makes pleasure and pain wonder love adoration hatred and terror how do these things grow

from a chemical reaction

i think they were here already i think the rocks

and the earth and the other planets and the stars and the galaxies

have their various consciousness all things are conscious

but the nerves of an animal the nerves and brain

bring it to focus the nerves and brain are like a burningglass

to concentrate the heat and make it catch fire

it seems to us martyrs hotter than the blazing hearth

from which it came so we scream and laugh clamorous animals

born howling to die groaning the old stones in the dooryard

prefer silence but those and all things have their own awareness

as the cells of a man have they feel and feed and influence each other each unto all

like the cells of a mans body making one being

they make one being one consciousness one life one god

and i understand my sisters when they say every woman has a story thats been told a maxim of one soul maybe less

and that is why youll never hear me call a woman slut bitch or a dyke

no matter what she does because i do not blame her

i blame the men who have emotionally and physically raped her

i blame these corporations whose images tell them they hate her

and i put my arms on her shoulder and tell her how great to life and

to god that she created her

god defines himself as i am who i am which also means my being is such that i shall always be present in every moment of becoming

life faculties productionin other words individuality liberty propertythis is man and in spite of the cunning of artful political leaders these three gifts from god precede all human legislation and are superior to it

he that takes truth for his guide and duty for his end may safely trust to gods providence to lead him aright

there are two atheisms of which one is a purification of the notion of god

everything you do is connected to who you are as a person and in turn creates the person you are becoming everything you do affects those you love all of life is covenant

what the father gives is the capacity to be a self freedom and thus autonomy but an autonomy which can be understood only as a surrender of self to the other

in christ for the first time we see that in god himself there existswithin his inseparable unitythe distinction between the father who gives and the gift which is given the son but only in the unity of the holy spirit

god listen to the absurdity within us and raise us from the illusion

come my child i said trying to lead her away wish goodbye to the poor hare and come and look for blackberries

oh my darling my darling she moaned over and over again and god meant your life to be so beautiful

meditating on the nature and dignity of prayer can cause saying at least one thing to god lord teach us to pray

the english experience suggested that nobody really doubted the existence of god until theologians tried to prove it

if you want nothing to do with god then why do you say his name all the time

we have to believe in a god who is like the true god in everything except that he does not exist since we have not reached the point where god exists

for liberty is an acknowledgment of faith in god and his works

a prayer is a chat with thy god

why do men have nipples because god is a woman and she really wants us to enjoy ourselves thats why

even on the cross he did not hide himself from sight rather he made all creation witness to the presence of its maker

those who set up a fictitious worship merely worship and adore their own delirious fancies indeed they would never dare so to trifle with god had they not previously fashioned him after their own childish conceits

past boldness is no assurance of future boldness boldness demands continual reliance on gods spirit

the selfrevealing of the word is in every dimension  above in creation below in the incarnation in the depth in hades in the breadth throughout the world all things have been filled with the knowledge of god

if god had intended us to follow recipes he wouldnt have given us grandmothers

all simple souls must admire and respect one another saying let us proceed each one along our path to the same goal united in purpose and by means of gods order which in its great variety is in us all

the world today is fast becoming onehumanity is one god is one and mankind are all part of one human family

all religions are connected and they all lead to faith in the one god no matter what name we give him he is but one god

in the bible the opposite of sin with a capital s is not virtue  its faith faith in a god who draws all to himself in his resurrection

what is important is not the specific manner in which god is worshiped but the degree to which the devotee is filled with love

about changing faith at our best christians embrace it leaving enough space within orthodoxy for god to surprise us every now and then

morality is everywhere the same for all men therefore it comes from god sects differ therefore they are the work of men

i found myself saying sacrifice is the secret  you have to sacrifice things for art and its the same

in my hands is power the power to hear or to destroy to grant life or to cause death i revere this gift have honed it over time an art as magnificent and awesome as any painting in the louvre

i an art i am science in all ways that matter i am god

god must be ruthless and farsighted god studies his creations and selects the best of these creations must be cherished protected sustained greatness rewards perfection

yet even the flawed have purpose

a wise god experiment considers uses what comes into his hands and forges wonders yes often without mercy often with a violence the ordinary condemn

i have nearly done so

if my work was discovered they with their foolish laws and attitudes would damn me

when my work is complete they will worship me

but the idea of goodness did attract me for i did not regard it as the opposite of sin i saw it as something bright and positive and sustaining like the sunshine something to be adored but from afar

i remember the day i started thinking this it was such a revelation to me it was the day my mother lost her faith in god she found that things of unquestioned certainty could never be trusted again

i dont believe in god and i certainly dont feel chosen

i think you may be

i smiled dubiously thank you

it is not meant as a compliment hazard makes you elect you cannot elect yourself

as a child i had been taught to say my prayers at the start of every day and so it did not seem an odd thing for me to stand out in the field and say oh god whatever happens today let it be under your perfect control

there are many problems which could only

be solved by generations which are still to be

born later its only one way of many how god

gives answers to human problems and prayers

sil nexistait pas dieu il faudrait linventer if god did not exist he would have to be invented

i saw my real gods   the gods of most men food drink and security in conformity

your father is the only god you can also become god but you must follow a simple rule and let that rule be made up of love

the mathematicians are the priests of the modern world

a certain wise man once said that god didnt play dice with the universe but that man was wrong sometimes i think he must even try russian roulette

it is sad that unless you are born a god your lifefrom its very beginning is a mystery to you

trust in him at all times you people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us selah

those who attempt to search into the majesty of god will be overwhelmed with his glory

god is only a word dreamed up to explain the world

the place to cure most of the ills of society is in the homes of the people

the world is a garden of philosophy god is its gardener man is the visitor

and any tree that does not bear fruits of philosophy either does not belong to

that garden or is yet to be grown

in rwanda one persons god is another persons satan

god doesnt act like the church no instead the church must act like god

god steals my soul

do you ever feel like we are the universe’s date to a pig party

the human race

people are not being reached in the context of the body of christtheyre like newborn babies being left on a doorstep somewhere to feed and care for themselves

let us tell them the painful truth that most of these works of art are about god whom we never mention in polite society

only is a bird doesnt swim in the ocean but flies in the air can it enter the ocean from above only because god is not temporal can he enter into time

those of us who embrace the feminine know its strength

there is only one allpervading god it has no religion no incarnation it is free from all contaminations

we degrade god too much ascribing to him our ideas in vexation at being unable to understand him

thank you heavenly father you heard my petition you have answered my plea

may your name be glorified and be praised

night doesn’t fall for my eyes

but my idea of the night is that it falls for my eyes

beyond my thinking and having any thoughts

the night falls concretely

and the shining of stars exists like it had weight

fear nothing but your conscience

if we become aware that someone is sending thoughts of ill will in our direction we do not argue with the apparent reality of malice to do so would give it more substance we remove the personal sense of ourself and the other person

god is only as strong as your belief in him

greatness comes from the inside and once you believe you have it its yours to share with the world

the character of jesus is the character of god god would never do something jesus would find morally reprehensible so if you can’t find it in jesus then you really ought to think twice before you claim you’ve found it in god

when you find that a theology has nothing more to offer than what the world already offers then that theology as a theology is impractical and therefore useless

only in the silence of our mind are we one

relationships are valuable no matter who they are between

hannah was reminded of what her bishop had said to her when shed spoken to him of her dreams our mind has a way of working out our fears but godhe has a way of making us a new creature if we let him

is it not the same distance to god everywhere

an ugly face needs makeup thats why man needs religion

god have pity on the smell of gasoline

which finds its way like an arm

through a car window

more human than kerosene

more unctuous more manly

the gods play no

you can’t selectively numb your anger any more than you can turn off all lights in a room and still expect to see the light

the steadfast love of the lord is not seasonal his mercies do not have winter or summer days they are new every now and then

isn’t that the way god works she’d thought he takes the things in our lives that are ugly disgusting and downright wicked and transforms them into something magnificent

when the door of opportunity of your storehouse opens for you let faith and hope enter first when your faith leads the way you will locate the source of your hidden treasures

we are often harsher judges than god himself

there’s enough metaphysics in not thinking about anything

if you drop your beliefs you drop your success gods mighty people begin to fall even as achievers when they begin to drop the beliefs they pursue at first

grace is godgiven power to live differently

there is nothing unforgivable and there are no secrets before an allknowing merciful god

the laws of god the laws of man

the laws of god the laws of man

he may keep that will and can

not i let god and man decree

laws for themselves and not for me

and if my ways are not as theirs

let them mind their own affairs

their deeds i judge and much condemn

yet when did i make laws for them

please yourselves say i and they

need only look the other way

but no they will not they must still

wrest their neighbor to their will

and make me dance as they desire

with jail and gallows and hellfire

and how am i to face the odds

of mans bedevilment and gods

i a stranger and afraid

in a world i never made

they will be master right or wrong

though both are foolish both are strong

and since my soul we cannot fly

to saturn nor to mercury

keep we must if keep we can

these foreign laws of god and man

man has  common problems with god the one is that there is evil in the world the other is that free will is limited the one he is charging that the world is too evil the other is that it is not evil enough

my grace is sufficient for thee the words soothed her soul like a healing balm

a stagecoach passed by on the road and went on

and the road didn’t become more beautiful or even more ugly

that’s human action on the outside world

we take nothing away and we put nothing back we pass by and we forget

and the sun is always punctual every day

god transforms us one area at a time

also at times on the surface of streams

and grow and burst

and have no meaning at all

except that they’re waterbubbles

growing and bursting

don’t be lookin up at no sky for help look down here at us twisted dreamers

i don’t always feel what i know i should feel

my thought crosses the river i swim very slowly

because the suit men made it wear weighs it down

we must surrender ourselves to god not our assignments

we start our lives with blues    with music its our first language its the rhythm of the womb its your mamas heartbeat inside your head

there are no roses in my yard what wind brought you

but i suddenly come from far away i was sick for a moment

no wind whatsoever brought you now

now you’re here

what you were isn’t you or else the whole rose would be here

a time is coming when the whole round world will know that god reigns and that god is love when hell and heaven life and death sin and salvation will be read and understood aright at last

all beings exist and nothing else

and that’s why they’re called beings

ill look to the cross

as my failure is lost

in the light of

your glorious grace

and so they chained down the poor in their ignorance so that they wouldnt stand up and fight their bosses who ruled in the name of the lie of divine right

reason in man is rather like god in the world

let the ruins come to life

in the beauty of your name

rising up from the ashes

god forever you reign

god i am trying to recover my faith please dont abandon me in the middle of

this adventure i prayed pushing my fears aside

i had no real communication with anyone at the time so i was totally dependent on god and he never failed me

the longer the trial to which god subjects you the greater the goodness in comforting you during the time of the trial and in the exaltation after the combat

jesus is gods way of refusing to give up his dream for the world

mysteries the more disoriented we become because he asks us constantly to

follow our dreams and our hearts and thats difficult to do when were used to living in a different way finally we discover to our surprise that god wants us to be happy because he is the father

sometimes new opportunity means new opposition not everything god asks us to do will be comfortable

if christ is god he cannot sin and if suffering was a sin in and by itself he could not have suffered and died for us however since he took the most horrific death to redeem us he showed us in fact that suffering and pain have great power

god is lucifer is a devil and there is a hell

the true christian can nurture a trustful optimism because he is certain of not walking alone in sending us jesus the eternal son made man god has drawn near to each of us in christ he has become our travelling companion

prayer at its highest is a twoway conversationand for me the most important part is listening to gods replies

but now here she was very wishful to pray while not knowing how to explain her dilemma ‘i’m terribly unhappy dear unprobable god—’ would not be a very propitious beginning

god gave laws to his people to bless them not to burden them every rule either elevates the quality of human life or restores ones relationship with god after a breach he makes no extraneous demands and he is never capricious

pretend you are a foolish to the tyrant – because if he realizes you are a genius he might use you to harm others

it takes faith to find personal significance in your relationship with god rather than how much money you earn how beautiful you look how many toys you own how many trophies you collect or how much territory you conquer and control

the human creature humiliated and offended in ways that are inconceivable to the mind and heart defies the blind and deaf divinity

to say that atheism is not a religion is the equivalent of saying anarchy is not really a political creed

dysfunction comes when we intertwine the church and god and view them as one

cos if its encyclopedias weve got enough like information and if its god youve got the wrong house

we live in a world where those things that we never imagine could ever do something did the best

it seems to me that religion is losing momentum and god is making a comeback

pretend you are foolish to the foolish and be yourself when you are alone or with others like you because if you take the foolish seriously as your friend you might be a fool yourself

all i know is that the closer i get to god the deeper i get into the bible and the heavier the burden seems on my shoulders

we have to be ready for the blessings god tosses at us in order to catch your blessing you have to let go of your burden

hope is magic hope is a gift hope is a raft we cling to in the midst of a storm hope by nature is an independent of logic hope is power outside of the facts

the human mind longs for something better hope is not rational yet who need rationality when god is on our side the capacity of hope is the most significant fact in life

our love grows soft if it is not strengthened by truth and our truth grows hard if it is not softened by love

what is the scent of water

renewal the goodness of god coming down like dew

we must never forget to pray and to ask god to remember us when he is arranging things so that we too may feel safe and have no anxiety about what is going to happen

you might even provide a heaven for them we need you for that hell we can make for ourselves

if you want to do the work of god pay attention to people notice them especially the people nobody else notices

the greatest cause in the world is joyfully rescuing people from hell meeting their earthly needs making them glad in god and doing it with a kind serious pleasure that makes christ look like the treasure he is

tears are gods way of cleansing the heart

god works in mysterious ways but at least he works hes never on welfare in a mysterious way

behavior is the substance of religion belief is the substance of relationship

there was a time when skepticism was an act of rebellion since to a degree i both believe in evolution and have faith i can only conclude that as prophesied to have faith will someday be an act of rebellion

our god is alive and well sorry about yours

if it is true if it is beautiful if it is honorable if it is right then claim it because it is from god and you belong to god

i wondered if it was blasphemous to tell god that rainbows are kitsch

god always ignores the present perfection for the ultimate perfection

god doesnt believe in the easy way

the primary purpose of reading the bible is not to know the bible but to know god

today i wonder why it is god refers to himself as father at all this to me in light of the earthly representation of the role seems a marketing mistake

if anybody didnt have a messiah complex it was jesus

through my choices and actions i have learned the most effective way of speaking to god is without saying a word

is mr kirkpatrick real i asked

after a long gulp of beer bickle said that’s the neocortex talking again

how does let go and let god measure up against scripture remember the test isnt what sounds deep what sounds holy or even what makes sense to us for the christian the test is scripture

hans clacked his sidelips do you have the sentence in your head that tomorrows procession will halt this pest of yours that it will bar the smalllives from the high woods

if it is as you say no no more than prayer can stay a charging horse but that is not why we pray god is no cheap juggler as to play for a pfennig

this hill though high i covet to ascend

the difficulty will not me offend

for i perceive the way to life lies here

come pluck up heart lets neither faint nor fear

better though difficult the right way to go

than wrong though easy where the end is woe

you may conquer her love of god you will never overcome her fear of the devil

only god can mend a broken heart

in the war of magic and religion is magic ultimately the victor perhaps priest and magician were once one but the priest learning humility in the face of god discarded the spell for prayer

if i reveal myself without worrying about how others will respond then some will care though others may not but who can love me if no one knows me i must risk it or live alone

but what we are given is taken as well so that we know gods glory comes to us from his will alone

go on my dear urges the snake take one hear it pluck me its saying that big shiny red one pluck me pluck me now and pluck me hard you know you want to

but god quotes eve putting out feelers for an agent provacateur clever girl expressly forbids us to eat the fruit from the tree of knowledge

eve folds her arms schoolgirlishly god expressly forbade it adam said

the snake grins through his fangs admiring eves playacting god is a nice enough chap in his way i daresay he means well but between you and the tree of knowledge he is terribly insecure

insecure he made the entire bloody universe hes omnipotent

it is just as crazy not to be crazy about christ as it is to be crazy about anything else

it is reasonable to love the absolute absolutely for the same reason it is reasonable to love the relative relatively

the human brain has the unique ability to doubt the reality presented to itself to comprehend the dissonance between ideas and the truth of the surrounding world god knows this and it infuriates him it terrifies him

god is not an exclamation point he is at his best a semicolon connecting people and generating what aldous huxley called human grace somewhere along the way we’ve lost sight of this

the trouble with me he thought unhappily is that i have been about the world long enough to know that gods plans for us however infallibly good may not take the form we expect and demand

it wasnt necessary to know your own demons in order to find god

every human being has divinity encased within its spirit and it is the task of its creator as well as itself to set it free no human being is an end product every being still breathing is a creation still under creation

god nevertheless required a little help from men and what he mostly got was hindrance

people dont get me

its more rule than exception

the only way jesus can be our king is if we allow him to be our servant

oh my soulbe prepared for him who knows how to ask questions

god tests but he does not tempt

you twitch as the darkness moves in and out of you it crawls up your spine and nestles in your brain like an evil thought from out of nowhere burying itself in your psyche like a starving leech looking for a vein

prayer is the quiet persistent living of our life of desire and faith in the presence of our god

live near to god and so all things will appear to you little in comparison to eternal realities

love is love it is godgiven and a sacrament it is not for any man to judge

god gives us not only the truth but also the ability to believe it not only the new thing to see but also the new eye to see it with

there is something deep within us that sobs at endings why god does everything have to end why does all nature grow old why do spring and summer have to go

fear cannot stay in the same house as jesus christ

the boss is an honorable man after the lord the most godly person ive ever met

youve met god

certainly i telephone him every night

contemplative prayer is natural unprogrammed it is perpetual openness to god so that in the openness his concerns can flow in and out of our minds as he wills

we are not to be occupied with our feelings or symptoms

or our faith or lack of faith

but only with what god has said

next to us is not the workman whom we have hired with whom we love so well to talk but the workman whose work we are

lift up your heads ye people

lift up your faces too

open your mouths to sing his praise

and the rain will fall on you

an entire nation shook under the power of one man’s mlk’s dream now if one dream can do that for our nation imagine what a dream can do for the church

was i sorry that i chose to come by hand cart no neither then nor any minute of my life since the price we paid to become acquainted with god was a privilege to pay and i am thankful that i was privileged to come in the martin hand cart company

no one knows the truth but those who have the truth

id rather be beautiful on thee inside where it is never seen by the world but always seen by the one true living god

self distrust is good but only if it leads to trust in god otherwise it ends as spiritual paralysis inability and unwillingness to undertake any course of action

at the end of time when god judges us humans i just hope he remembers to judge himself as well

providence is wiser than you and you may be confident it has suited all things better to your eternal good than you could do had you been left to your own option

unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance

on a high mountain i stood

and cried the name of ali lion of god

bring joy to our sorrowful hearts

in relationship to god one can not involve himself to a certain degree god is precisely the contradiction to all that is to a certain degree

it doesn’t cause me to doubt god’s existence but it does force me to admit there’s a lot about god i don’t understand

and the news got worse it appeared that there was this whole other person jesus christ whose birthday a lot of people tended to confuse with mine i was personally outraged it was a long time before i forgave the lord for that

what use after all is man if not to teach god his lessons

to their simple degenerate minds there was only one thing to do when faced by a god more powerful than their own convert

but somehow once you start playing behind the steering wheel of god you realize just how powerful it is to be the imagination driving the natural world

i have yet to hear gods audible voice although i have often felt led by god in more subtle ways

god of the impossible maker of all miracles i stand in awe of you im so amazed by how you reach into my brokenness make me beautiful again i believe yes i believe nothing is impossible with you

the mind is constituted to accept the god of the more powerful if you have to choose between the god of the slave owner and the god of the enslaved naturally you will choose the former

this is perhaps the hardest truth of any to grasp do we wake up every morning amazed that we are loved by god

god being the old man invented in order to and with whom to hold long conversations

do i believe in god sure so i believe the bible is the arbiter of theological knowledge there it gets a little hazy

god is always working in every detail of our lives to help us turn our heart toward him the life weve always wanted is found in jesus

when i think of existence i cannot help but wonder what is life anyway where do i fit in the grand scheme of life what is the point of it anyway is this a test—and if so am i passing it

engage in no pursuit in which you cannot look up unto god and say bless me in this my father

men will trust in god no further than they know him and they cannot be in the exercise of faith in him one ace further than they have a sight of his fulness and faithfulness in exercise

the word ezer is used only twenty other places in the entire old testament and in every other instance the person being described is god himself when you need him to come through for you desperately

no not christ these leavings were made in propitiation of a much older god than the christian one people

have called him different things at different times but rachel’s sister gave him a perfectly good name i think

oz the gweat and tewwible god of dead things left in the ground god of rotting flowers in drainage ditches

god of the mystery

nothing will unfold for us unless we move toward what

looks to us like nothing faith is a cascade

as the needs of all living things must we have proved that it is a very safe thing to trust in the lord our god

her marys son first had to be the child of the father in order then to become man and be capable of taking up on his shoulders the burden of a guilty world

o lord i am further away from me than from you

but he looks no more than thirty hes very handsome so much you will admit nor will you deny that he is very wealthy and very powerful the greatest nobleman in brittany he will make me a great lady

god made you that aline

i suppose therefore god is the connoisseur of filthied hearts and souls and can see the old the first pattern in them and cherish them for that

mary thus learns that the most high has ever borne a son in his bosom and that this son has now chosen her bosom as dwellingplace

without a spiritual wakefulness to divine purposes and connections in all things we will not know things for what they truly are

rashidis eyes brightened a god that loves people now theres a new thought

do i have your permission to be a supernatural god if i want to open heaven and in a moment in time touch the heart of a daughter and supernaturally break all the darkness shame and torment in her life may i do that

please dear god of happiness show the radiance of your spectrum to our world which here means to forget everything

does anybody know which are the thoughts of god even if they are plants mountains sky stars or whatever else

can i tell from the twilight from which the world is built that i am a sunrise in this life

once we are a creation how much absurdity can there be in our heart without god the creator

the wise words of a friend and guide rang in my head how would you distinguish a true servant of god from a traitoryou should take especial notice of how a person speaks not of other things but of god

whoever extolleth him as a god of love doth not think highly enough of love itself did not that god want also to be judge but the loving one loveth irrespective of reward and requital

i remembered robyn telling me the story of shadrach meshach and abednego and how theyd survived when the king chucked them in the furnace and an angel or someone went in with them the furnace blazed all around them but they didnt burn

you speak of doing good to the world is the world such a small thing and who are you pray to do good to the world first realise god see him by means of spiritual discipline if he imparts power you can do good to others otherwise not

there is an old joke that went around it goes in the beginning god made man in his own image and since the fall man has been seeking to return the compliment

genetic code is a divine writing

these are men who are simple

they are fields of corn

they have the grandeur

that the fools call emptiness

some men are not simple

they live in cities

among the teeming buildings

wrestling with forces

as strong as the sun and the rain

often they must forgo dream upon dream

christ walks in the wilderness

in such lives

because christ has put on

the nature of man like a garment and worn it to his own shape

he has put on everyones life

to the workmans clothes to the kings red robes

to the snowy loveliness of the wedding garment

christ has put on mans nature

and given him back his humanness

i choose to believe god had a more direct involvement in the creation of my heart and consciousness than in the creation of any book no matter how thick or old it may be

i think it was at this point that i decided i would rather remember mailer as the author of harlots ghost and the armies of the night

if you seek for supreme predator go find god

he hunts the prime killer of mankind the satan

the divine is always abominable

houses under the sea

they served good food but only a g an o and a d were lit up personally i doubted god dined there unless god was keen on samonella poisoning and rat droppings in the hamburgers but then again what did i know

god listens through the atomic door of love

at the beginning was the word

today i see that in great quotes

there either is a god or there is not there is a design or not

gods dream is interwoven into reality by humans

i am who i am said god to moses regarding his name

because none was worth to be compared to his godhead

a winner smiles and a looser cries the god looks at them and sayssorry guys

i once had a dream human was a chosen beast

domesticated by god to manage the planet earth

if god is anonymous let it be

no matter what gods power may be the first aspect of god is never that of the absolute master the almighty it is that of the god who puts himself on our human level and limits himself

with wine and being lost with

less and less of both

i rode through the snow do you read me

near he sang

it was

our last ride over

the hurdled humans

they cowered when

they heard us

overhead they

wrote they

lied our neighing

into one of their

extinction catches man by surprise because no one can even imagine that such a catastrophe can happen to an intelligent species

the worst mockery god can make of a moralist is that he compels him to be a

what is the basic difference between saying i know that god exists and saying i know that love exists

the word says god put ever star in the heavens and even give ever one of em a name if one of em was gon fall out the sky that was up to him too maybe we cant see where its gon wind up be he can

when god breaks in the only thing you can do is believe it or not you cannot ask for a receipt of the transaction or a sign for the dubious god does not offer to cover your backside

there are no perfect human beings and even those who we pray such as allah buddha jesus krishna among others were not perfect

salvation is more than a word it is his word his word became flesh so we have the opportunity to live

one of the strengths of the belief in antinous was its appeal to the most sensitive and inward of mystical natures as well as to the exuberant joyous and ecstatic sides of human experience

god is a philosophical black hole – the point where reason breaks down

the being called godbears every mark of a veil woven by philosophical conceit to hide the ignorance of philosophers even from themselves they borrow the threads of its texture from the anthropomorphism of the vulgar

life is a question asked by god about the way he exists

the divine voice is not always expressed in words it is made known as a heartconsciousmess

one reason might be that if i hadnt tripped id have been hamburger

and that leads me to my insight god was not there at the beginning of evolution god is what lies at the end of it

we imagine that our theologicalconceptual systems are the means by which we know god as god is i truly believe that such postures and perspectives put us in danger of conceptual idolatry worshiping our ideas of and frameworks for god

we are no longer so lacking in fantasy as to uphold the existence of a god

i am for

one world without fear and corruption

one world ruled by truth and justice

i am for

one peaceful world for all

where hate has been overcome by love

and everyone is guided only

by their conscience

if people in the position of power are not made to be accountable then ungodliness injustice and oppression will continue to be the order of the day in the society

i would fight every angel between us until god said yes

if god were to make a million lovely flowers in your image and plant them in a garden with you among them i would still know you by your scent and by the feel of your petals and by the crazy way you lean towards my light whenever i draw near

with god brokenness is nothing more than the stage upon which the impossible is about to happen

unless you understand the pain and sufferings of the people trees birds and the nature how can you understand god

i ascended the mountains to hear the voice of god and was answered in echoes from afar

god chose to save you for a purpose

if god is for you nothing can stand against you

the more i connect with my sensuality the more i experience god as the wind blows through the curtains that’s how sweet his presence is

illiteracy is the number one promoter of ignorance

if one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child then one million of you are a million times guilty

god’s on your side be on god’s side

if one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty

how can we abstain from sexual immorality only god can give us the grace

we should be able to refuse enchanting proposals and opportunities if they contradict god’s principles

no crime is a means to an end no crime can be rationalized

we can neither hurry nor hasten the works of god

i am not a man of god i am too little to be that but once in a while i like to believe in that thing called destiny

we are living in the falsehood due to the erroneous teachings of the society community and the bordered nations

be confident because you are a child of god be humble because everyone else is too

don’t be scared of anything trust in the lord and face the battle of life there is no power on earth that can lay you low

once you have seen his face you will forever long to see it again

before you die please share your love with the unknown immortal existence which is in your body and unite with the divine to live in godliness after you die

we stand and fight for god’s truth and with the truth we will win

in our village folks say god crumbles up the old moon into stars

its ok to be a fool once or twice but never let it be a third time be smart and pretend to be a fool and at the end of the hunt make sure youre the one that has the gun

above all trust in the slow work of god

the most boring and unproductive question one can ask of any religion is whether or not it is true

when you cultivate a godly thought life your soul will shine and you will exhibit the presence of the lord in you

service to humanity is service to god

he who called her so called her by her true name for she is the full moon of full moons afore god

the morning light shimmered through the trees and gave the lake an otherworldly hue everything in summer michigan seemed to have a soft shimmer to it as though god had hung gauze over the sky and softly scattered glitter on all his creations

clearly outline your plans acknowledge god and he will direct them for you if you can have it planned you can achieve it if you have it planned big you will achieve it big make your choice

god will save whomever he chooses to save the christian should proselytize not because he thinks he can change everybody he should proselytize because the gospel being shared is the ultimate act of love because he thinks he can love everybody

your power is in your story and all the wisdom it has brought you

fame is not the reason why brands are created and erected be diligent focused and chain unceasing prayers to god who will continue giving you cheers

knowing the truth is not based on knowledge but on being it

the opportunity to do what is right is available at all times

first knowledge is the knowledge of god

camomille fallible men write books god writes in sunlight and rivers and planets isnt the universe a good book i trust it above the printed kind

god speaks to you all the time  have you tuned in to the cosmic vibrations of love harmony peace and truth unless you quieten that blabbering little mind of yours you won’t be able to listen to the divine music that plays on and on

just for one heavenly second shut your eyes ears and mind to the cacophonous noises of this physical illusionary temporary world exit all the drama

just for that one heavenly second stay quiet and simply listen listen to the ambrosial sound it vibrates with joy

you can have more of this soulful peace in your life if only you choose to align yourself with the source of love and light the more you stay attuned to home the less you’d wander invain

spiritual joy is what you experience when you choose to give thanks to god no matter what happens—even when things go wrong

devotion to god righteousness and wisdom will keep us safe on earth

what is life to spirit is death to the ego

the lord is god

know your real self beyond who you think you are

but god does give us responsibility and it takes biblical faith to do those things in dependence on god

our lives must be spent seeking our god for god hides but his artifices once they be known seem so simple and smiling from that moment the merest nothing reveals his presence and the greatness of our life depends on so little

one day i realized without god nothing matters so i asked him into my heart

the gods seldom

but so quickly

when you are posessed by evil spirits it is crafty manipulations that you follow but when you are posessed by the holy spirit of god it is wise discretions you pursue

and i find a happiness in the fact of accepting —

in the sublimely scientific and difficult fact of accepting the inevitable natural

things don’t have significance they only have existence

things are the only hidden meaning of things

i pass and i stay like the universe

everything’s different from us that’s why everything exists

what does this think about that

nothing thinks about anything

does the earth have consciousness of its stones and plants

if it did it would be people

why am i worrying about this

if i think about these things

i’ll stop seeing trees and plants

and stop seeing the earth

for only seeing my thoughts

i’ll get unhappy and stay in the dark

and so without thinking i have the earth and the sky

believe believe in your destiny and the star from which it shines believe you have been sent from god as an arrow shot from his own bow

it is the single universal trait that the great of this earth have all shared while the shadows are fraught with ghosts who roam the winds with mournful wails of regret on their lips

believe as if your life depended on it for indeed it does

pray each morning and each night

talk to god and be polite

tell him what youre grateful for

leave your troubles at his door

share your wishes needs and hopes

ask god how to bravely cope

tell him all you learned today

say the things you need to say

beg forgiveness for your sins

pray to live with him again

speak with earnest heart and soul

he will listen this i know

for prayer is hope put to the test

and hope is faith in what is best

faith is power to do great things

thus prayer is faiths enabling wings

prayer is an insurance policy that you can never lapse on

even in hardship god’s goodness prevails

if i die very young hear this

i was never anything but a kid playing

i was a heathen like the sun and the water

i had the universal religion only people don’t have

i was happy because i didn’t ask for anything at all

or tried to find anything

and i didn’t find any more explanation

than the word explanation having no meaning at all

growth comes from god to those with surrendered yielded hearts

as your heart goes so goes your family if your heart isnt right no child raising system rules or gimmicks will ever work as your heart goes so goes your parenting

leave fears aside clean tears away tell god here i am use me and hell give you the assignments that will make your life a fulfilled one now dress up to work

all the evil in the world comes from us bothering with each other

wanting to do good wanting to do evil

our soul and the sky and the earth are enough for us

to want more is to lose this and be unhappy

our scripture awakened that most glorious of things the spontaneous love our lord so desires his children to bear him for it is what he bears them

a kid thinking about fairy tales and believing in fairy tales

acts like a sick god but like a god

because even though he affirms that what doesn’t exist exists

he knows things exist that he exists

he knows existing exists and doesn’t explain itself

and he knows there’s no reason at all for anything to exist

he knows being is the point

all he doesn’t know is that thought isn’t the point

between what i see in a field and what i see in another field

there passes for a moment the figure of a man

his steps go with him in the same reality

but i look at him and them and they’re two things

the man goes walking with his ideas false and foreign

and his steps go with the ancient system that makes legs walk

i see him from a distance without any opinion at all

how perfect that he is in him what he is — his body

his true reality which doesn’t have desires or hopes

but muscles and the sure and impersonal way of using them

praise be to god i’m not good

and have the natural egotism of flowers

and rivers following their bed

preoccupied without knowing it

only with blooming and flowing

this is the only mission in the world

this—to exist clearly

and to know how to do it without thinking about it

i was born subject like others to errors and defects

but never to the error of wanting to understand too much

never to the error of wanting to understand only with the intellect

never to the defect of demanding of the world

that it be anything that’s not the world

it is god’s omnipotence his consuming holiness and his right to judge that make him worthy to be feared

free will either you follow the word of god or youll be punished with eternal hellfire thats the same kind of choice an abuse boyfriend gives you either you do exactly what i say or ill beat the shit out of you

the perplexity the potential— god’s own crucible was not for angels

have you ever tried thinking of god as a person instead of an allpowerful vending machine that never gives you the right amount of change he has feelings too you know

he who has the audacity to stop you from dreaming is he who had given you the imaginations to think but not those who watch you as you explore the dreams

if you can change the way you think in time you will notice a change in your heart and also a change in your life and the way you see things

my actions should draw people to the god i serve not my sales pitch if people want what i have theyll ask me how to get it if not thats their business

if you cant focus then how do you expect to make your dreams come true

i dont think theres anything wrong with borrowing someone elses faith to get you through until you get enough on your own

i am the chosen of the lord for who he loveth so doeth he chastiseth but i be durn if he dont take some curious ways to show it seems like

he realized he needed strength sustenance that couldn’t come from bread alone he desperately needed god

we need to abandon our scale and adopt gods because our misguided labels keep us from the right kind of interaction with people

sometimes god takes your life for some crazy twists and turns

come to think of it maybe god is a he after all because only a cruel force would create something this beautiful and make it inaccessible to most people

we are supernaturalists first not naturalists the only reason we feel compelled to accommodate science is that science says we ought to but it is science that should accommodate revelation revelation has been around much longer

to paraphrase paul god often uses the cheesy to confound the sophisticated he regularly honors those who are confused about his leading as if they have nailed it

as is typical of this god of israel he calls his people into freedom in the most unlikely place

prayer aint weakened by distance

what we really need is only a heart of surrender  always trust what god has plan for our life so we do our best god shall take the rest thats what i called faith

that very breath wherewith they utter their complaints is a blessing and a fundamental one too for if god would withdraw that they were incapable of whatsoever else either have or desire

god is but a supernatural spirit he resides dormant in you until you awaken to liberate yourself from this ignorance that you are body and mind

as wade clark roof noted in his study the weightlessness of contemporary belief in god is a realityfor religious liberals and many evangelicals

he who challenges the god in his dying bed is indisputably the most courageous man but not the cleverest one

our spiritual history is the history of godventriloquists the truth is that the voice of god is the voice of cunning man the ventriloquists voice

they cried yes yes they cried cried more tears than the mississippi could hold but those tears never washed away their faith…

the world will be brighter and wiser without religions but it will surely be darker and more hopeless without god

i have done nothing but open windowsgod has done all the rest

god generously helps to those who try to do their best without asking god’s help

and we ask ourselves if there is a god how can this happen better to ask if there is a god must it be sane

i dont like to hear cut and dried sermons no—when i hear a man preach i like to see him act as if he were fighting bees

excuse me she said politely but you cant have him not yet hes going to come back with me

god is a cloud from which rain fell

devil and god – two sides of the same face

the devil has not vanished simply because people refuse to believe he exists no more than god has

the only people who soul can truly magnify the lord arepeople who acknowledge their lowly estate and are overwhelmed by the condescension of the magnificent god

cosmos is god who whispered the syllable of life

the grandeur of god reveals itself through simple things

god is busy and has no time for you

words are god’s gift to mend a broken soul

by the external appearance of your knowledge you have attained high ranks and reverence with the people so seek with allah higher ranks and closeness by virtue of your hidden good deeds and know that these two ranks one cancels out the other

telling someone like my mother that hell is a real physical place somewhere you can travel to and from would be like spraypainting the statue of jesus hanging over the pulpit during mass better off telling her the pope is gay

you are the grace of my life

so tender so undeserved

hard to believe youre my wife

even harder to put what i feel into words

if i need evidence god is good

just looking at you is enough

you are the grace of my life

for you grace my life with your love

god help me i am small and alone but i must help them and i most not waste a moment because every moment another soul dies

have you ever had an experience with god as wild as your most incredible sexual experience

new rome will be destroyed

by the attacks of new vandals

fundamentalists offer us a loving god who is some kind of divine stalker

baby pollution rises up then the loving comes arraigning cause

our arts official and only partially artificial

and our hearts in the middle of sharp hardened shards of metal but

theres not where it settles

because its beating to the steaming of gods hottest pot or kettle

and now we face it this creation we made to

to save our craving for a synthetic rebelnation its

our safeway they make into a pathetic revelation

in our steampunk nation

our steampunk nation

the world is gods salvation

when god becomes routine rather than revival its time to switch things up

when following god zero we never find

god never asked us to meet lifes pressures and demands on our own terms or by relying upon our own strength nor did he demands that we win his favor by assembling an impressive portfolio of good deeds instead he invites us to enter his rest

the word of god i think of as a straight edge which shows up our own crookedness we cant really tell how crooked our thinking is until we line it up with the straight edge of scripture

when ours are interrupted his are not his plans are proceeding exactly as scheduled moving us always including those minutes or hours or years which seem most useless or wasted or unendurable

it is better to have god over your shoulder than carry the world alone on your back

until the will and the affections are brought under the authority of christ we have not begun to understand let alone accept his lordship the cross as it enters the love life will reveal the heart’s truth

the size of a challenge should never be measured by what we have to offer it will never be enough furthermore provision is gods responsibility not ours we are merely called to commit what we have  even if its no more than a sack lunch

either we are adrift in chaos or we are individuals created loved upheld and placed purposefully exactly where we are can you believe that can you trust god for that

god presents the sabbath rest as a shelter we can enter hebrews

god never calls his people to accomplish anything without promising to supply their every need

while god for the most part allows this cosmos creation to work according to the laws of nature there is never a time when he is not actively involved in every detail of life

choose to view life through gods eyes

in seasons of hiddenness our sense of value is disrupted stripped of what others affirmed us to be in this season god intends to give us an unshakable identity in him that no amount of adoration nor rejection can alter

when we panic we instinctively turn to our own internal resources because we doubt him

its not enough merely to believe there is a god you must believe in the god who is there

boldness in the course of a noble fight is worth the riskif you stand on truth youll only regret your timidity later but youll never regret being bold

faith itself cannot accomplish anything yet without faith no one can fly

sin may have the power to kill and destroy but god is the creator of life he can create it from nothing and he can restore it from deathjohn

the matters we or the world might consider trivial he cares about and wants to remedy he longs to relieve our worries and has promised to supply our most fundamental needs

the wise men posit questions to which they may not always find immediate answers but through their reflections god stimulates man in his search for truth  which in the last analysis is a search for god himself

israels first king saul looked like he was born for the role he was tall handsome intelligent and sensitive to gods leading but he eventually lost most of his attractive qualities the most important being obedience

i live my life in widening circle

that reach out across the world

i may not ever complete the last one

but i give myself to it

i circle around god that primordial tower

i have been circling for thousands of years

and i still dont know am i a falcon

a storm or a great song i

god deals us all different hands how we play em is up to us

life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind

lifeas god intended it enables us to live above the drag of fear superstition shame pessimism guilt anxiety worry and all the negativity that keeps people from seizing each day as a gift from him

the crisis of physical hunger is essentially a crisis of faith what or whom will you trust to meet your most basic needs will you trust the god who made human bodies or will you seek your own way deuteronomy

if there is a god or hundreds of them i hope they will forgive me for the harm i may have inflicted on you by telling you exactly what happened

the lord gives and the lord takes away as it pleases him for he can do all things

to require god to prove that he is able and willing to fulfill his promises would be proof positive that one does not trust him

if god created shadows it was to better emphasise the light

thinking while being interrogated by the germans you big shots think you can decide on my life but i have news for you you cant touch a hair on my head without the will of god my father because he is on my side

what i do not like about our definitions of genius is that there is in them nothing of the day of judgment nothing of resounding through eternity and nothing of the footsteps of the almighty

submitting seemed to me a lot like giving up if god gave us the strength to bail the gumption to try and save ourselves isnt that what he wanted us to do

i would stand there at times and remember how beautiful god created this world and then i would be reassured that he would certainly take care of me and all of my loved ones

elizabeths barreness and advanced agea double symbol of hopelessnessbecame the means by which god would announce to the world that nothing is impossible for him

old religious dogma attempts to convince you that you are on a journey to god then makes you pay tolls along that roadway

if its not for him i guess id be dead few years ago

for though i walk through the valley of shadows of death i will never fear for you are in me and i know you will never let me go

though the ancient poet in plutarch tells us we must not trouble the gods with our affairs because they take no heed of our angers and disputes we can never enough decry the disorderly sallies of our minds

well its just painful to see them without nothing to eat and at the same time no god so lets share our food and our god

everything in life had a purpose and unless it achieved that purpose it was just taking up space on the planet and wasting everybodys time

to realize that we are just a breath away from eternity takes a lot of guts and brain power so spend your breath wisely

god only knows the issue

do we always do the things that god would take pleasure or that we do things we think god would take pleasure

holiness consists simply in doing gods will and being just what god wants us to be

those who fight against gods people are fighting against god and fighters against god will not prevail

do you not see the madonna always beside the tabernacle

it is unfortunate that in most cases when the sins of the father fall on the son it is because unlike god people refuse to forgive and forget and heap past wrongs upon innocent generations

saying that you are moral because you believe in a god is like saying you are an economist because you play monopoly

you only get one body it is the temple of your soul even god is willing to dwell there if you truly treat your body like a temple it will serve you well for decades if you abuse it you must be prepared for poor health and a lack of energy

conscience is the light by which we interpret the will of god in our own lives

the place that the shepherds found was not an academy or an abstract republic it was not a place of myths allegorised or dissected or explained or explained away it was a place of dreams come true

for i know that we laughers have a gross cousinship with the most high and it is this contrast and perpetual quarrel which feeds a spring of merriment in the soul of a sane man

of course in the process you must never do harm to others in any serious way or youll cease to amuse him then payment comes due for promises you didnt keep

i prayed to a mystery

praying into a bank of fog requires alot of effort i wanted an image to focus on when i prayed i wanted something to pray to but i couldnt go back to that old man he was too closely associated with all id left behind

gift better than himself god doth not know

gift better than god no man can see

this gift doth here the giver given bestow

gift to this gift let each receiver be

god is my gift himself he freely gave me

gods gift am i and none but god shall have me

that wish  that prayer  both men and women would have scorned me for  but father thou wilt not despise i said and felt that it was true

there are still many souls to be won for christ she answered with quiet dignity eyes downcast—but not he figured in humility even here perhaps especially here where better to spread his love than a country just recently ravaged by war

where better to be kidnapped and sold into slavery than a country just recently ravaged by war with a discernible sneer

the realm of god is dangerous you must enter into it and not just seek information about it

life will be a whole lot better if we understand what our salvation in christ means

by the end of the war i could pick out jewish people almost as if i had a sixth sense about it even if they had blue eyes and blond hair i would have been a very valuable gestapo person

after the prayer they executed an armed robbery that sounds very strange this many years later prayer and then armed robbery

be strong live happy and love but first of all

him whom to love is to obey and keep

his great command

your mind was made to know and love god

lord i believe help my unbelief is the best any of us can do really but thank god it is enough

god arranges everything for us so that we need have no more fear or trouble and may be quite sure that all things will come right in the end

when we live in the love of god we begin to pay attention to people the way god pays attention to us

you won’t ever get ahead if you keep feeling sorry for yourself you must stop all the negative talk and start thinking positive you have a lot of potential but your life won’t change until you change how you think

so we make stories of our own in fevered and envious imitation of our maker hoping that well tell by chance what god left untold and finishing our tale come to understand why we were born

but deep this truth impressd my mind

thro all his works abroad

the heart benevolent and kind

the most resembles god

the evil and suffering in this world are greater than any of us can comprehend but evil and suffering are not ultimate god is satan the great lover of evil and suffering is not sovereign god is

like adam we have all lost paradise and yet we carry paradise around inside of us in the form of a longing for almost a memory of a blessedness that is no more or the dream of a blessedness that may someday be again

if we are serious about loving god we must begin with people all people and especially we must learn to love those that the world generally discards

every day you and i walk through gods shop every day we brush up against objects of incalculable worth to him people every one of them carries a price tag if only we could see it

it is not objective proof of gods existence that we want but whether we use religious language for it or not the experience of gods presence

if we require some kind of sign or proof for our belief in god then we believe or place our tust not in god but in the sign or proof

and of the sixth day yet remained

there wanted yet the master work the end

of all yet done a creature who not prone

and brute as other creatures but endued

with sanctity of reason might erect

his stature and upright with front serene

govern the rest selfknowing and from thence

magnanimous to correspond with heaven

but grateful to acknowledge whence his good

descends thither with heart and voice and eyes

directed in devotion to adore

and worship god supreme who made him chief

of all his works

he does not call those who are worthy but those whom he will

there is a god in whom i do not believe

yet to this god my love stretches

this god whom i do not believe in is

my whole life my life and i am his

everything that i have of pleasure and pain

of pain of bitter pain and mens contempt

i give this god for him to feed upon

as he is my whole life and i am his

when i am dead i hope that he will eat

everything i have been and have not been

and crunch and feed upon it and grow fat

eating my life all up as it is his

god the eater

the servant who really studies his master gradually becomes like his master gradually learns that he himself is the one who in the end does all the work and has all the power

once i remember father abbot said that our purpose is justice and with god lies the privilege of mercy but even god when he intends mercy needs tools to his hand

inherent rights are from god and the tragedies of the world originate in their attempted denial

tell me something do you believe in god

snow darted an apprehensive glance in my direction what who still believes nowadays

it isnt that simple i dont mean the traditional god of earth religion im no expert in the history of religions and perhaps this is nothing newdo you happen to know if there was ever a belief in animperfect god

snow hesitated but his attitude no longer showed any of the wary reserve of recent weeks

there was manicheanism

nothing at all to do with the principles of good and evil i broke in immediately this god has no existence outside of matter he would like to free himself from matter but he cannot

snow pondered for a while

i kept on

we already have snow said sarcastically novas and supernovas according to you they are candles on his altar

if youre going to take what i say literally

what gave you this idea of an imperfect god

i dont know it seems quite feasible to me that is the only god i could imagine believing in a god whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purposea god who simply is

learned arguments do not make a man holy and righteous whereas a good life makes him dear to god

suffering often draws us closer to god instead of being a sign of gods punishment or distance suffering can purify us lead us into the heart of god and transform our souls

spiritual yearning is the homesickness of the soul

the cautious faith that never saws off a limb on which it is sitting never learns that unattached limbs may find strange unaccountable ways of not falling

you and i are part of the colony of heaven right now we may reside here on earth but our passport indicates that our citizenship is in heaven we are on the earth but not of the earth

yes she believed god loved her but if this whole fiasco was his idea of love

children like god see only our actions

god goes with thoughtless people

if youre male and youre christian and living in america your father is your model for god and sometimes you find your father in your career

doubtless by definition god was reason itself but would he also be reasonable

i need just be a bayonet a bayonet named diving punishment i wish id been born a storm or a menace or a single grenade no heart no tears just as a terrible galed have been good if by doing this i become that then so be it

in the name of god they stole her time and her freedom putting shackles on her heart they preached about gods kindness but preached twice as much about his wrath and intolerance

what mortal claims by searching to the utmost limit to have found out the nature of god or of his opposite or of that which comes between seeing as he doth this world of man tossed to and fro by waves of contradiction and strange vicissitudes

how charming is divine philosophy

not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose

but musical as is apollos lute

and a perpetual feast of nectard sweets

where no crude surfet raigns

god is as real as a station wagon

the sight of her made him understand why hed lost his faith in god

if a man cannot serve two masters neither can christianity or several thousand of them as the case may be

adam and eve had firsthand empirical evidence of god’s existence he walked in the garden with them their problem was that god told them they could not eat of a certain tree – p

i would put myself in the attitude to look in the eye an abstract truth and i cannot i blench and withdraw on this side and on that i seem to know what he meant who said no man can see god face to face and live

disasters work like alarm clocks to the world hence god allows them they are shouting wake up love pray

one of the greatest gifts from god is the eternal perspective it is a level of fearlessness a level of understanding where one can experience even emotional harmony with god

the connection between art and christ is like the connection between sunlight and the sun it is in fact the connection between sonlight and the son

god is love i said but arts the possibility of forms and shadows are the source of identity

knowledge and book learning are not wisdom said the captain

is this book wisdom asked lucy putting the manuscript back on the table

only when it is seen that what decides each individuals destiny is whether or not god decides to save him from his sins and that this is a decision that god need not make in any individual case can one begin to grasp the biblical view of grace

keep it simple and keep it real the more basic we see our connection to god and spirit the easier it is to feel like youre a part of it

before god does anything before he makes anything for us to be sustained by god says more than food more than water more than shelter more than other people they are going to need me

marty my mother used to say never get greedy with god i think what she meant was dont dare ask for more if you already have what you need

the suffering of the christian or anyone else in this world is never ultimately an accident all suffering is within the pale of divine sovereignty all suffering comes within the broader context of the sovereignty of god

dominance is only for god

we are in god’s hands we can’t come up with a surprise big enough or a sin vile enough to thwart his plan if we allow him to refine us we will inevitably end up free from the impurities that separate us from him

you were born into this life equipped to succeed you are a part of god’s perfect plan yes you the plan would not be perfect if you were missing think about that you matter more than you know

god is merciful cant we all be on the right track of faith but just using different roads

if we do not know the king that comes to your bedroom for the sole purpose of taking out your trash then you have yet to know jesus as the servant of all

everyone claims to be okay with freedom of religion but the moment you mention god there is a strange tension that fills the air if there was a th sense that would be it

at best we are but clay animated dust but viewed as sinners we are monsters indeed let it be published in heaven as a miracle that the lord jesus should set his hearts love upon people like us

the best proof that he will never cease to love us lies in that he never began

stories are masks of god

thats a story too of course i made it up in collaborations with joseph campbell and scheherazade jesus and the buddha and the brothers grimm

stories show us how to bear the unbearable approach the unapproachable conceive the inconceiveable stories provide meaning texture layers and layers of truth

so it seemes to me that one of the most vital things we can teach our children is how to be storytellers how to tell stories that are rigorously insistently beautifully true and how to believe them

mystical experiences do not necessarily supply new ideas to the mind rather they transform what one believes into what one knows converting abstract concepts such as divine love into vivid personal realities

in recent times more and more human thinking has come to assume that the idea of a universal natural law and the idea of god are pointing to one and the same reality

the glory of god is as destructive of evil as it is creative of good

man was designed in a way in which he must eat in order to give him a solid reason to go to work everyday this helps to keep him out of trouble god is wise

if you cant illustrate it it doenst belong in physics as a noun you cant put an article in front you cant put a verb after

gods holiness is not an unloving holiness and gods love is not an unholy love it is only by keeping these two primary moral qualities of the divine being closely related that we may rightly behold the character of god p

it is ignorance or at least lack of consideration of heavenly things that make the temporal things of this world whether good or evil greater than they really are

a mathematician is an individual who believes that prophesying that his dog will die if he deprives it of food constitutes a prediction

‘what’s that’

jaz looked at him trying to find a clue in his gaunt face in the clear gray eyes watching him with such  what amusement condescension there was something about the man which brought on a sort of hermeneutic despair he was a forest of signs

‘we’re hunting for jokes’ bachman spoke slowly as if to a child ‘parapraxes cosmic slips of the tongue they’re the key to the locked door they’ll help us discover it’

‘discover what’

fear only one person that is god listen to only one voice that is your conscience

justin martyr explained the distinction and the sameness of the father and the son with the analogy of a candle the flame can pass from one candle to another without changing in quality or diminishing the first

no human mind can fully grasp the gift of christ’s atonement the vastness and inclusiveness of the act—but in the end it comes down to just you and jesus you’ve come and he’s met you with open arms—and now it’s just between the two of you

i wrestled through many sleepless nights after god became real to me i can only describe this period of my life as  years of mental agony

prayer is our yearning for god the cry of our poverty and misery stretching out toward the throne of his divine mercy

god is super intelligent  says go  do good things if not i may pick you as an odd human  like a honest dog knows what to do next

when god creat the worldfirst he must think abour architects

many love humanity only in order to forget god with a clear conscience

what i learned in rwanda was that god is not absent when great evil is unleashed whether that evil is manmade or helped along by darker forces god is right there saving those who respond to his urgings and trying to heal the rest

i love god jesus christ my three children mother father brother sisters family in general my pets my students and true friends

we must imagine our lives well we must engage our conscience conscience is the voice of god in the nature and heart of man

atheism is the opium of the mathematicians atheism is the religion of mathematics

pagan that you are what does that signify

to heck with praying i shouted bail dammit bail

surrounded by your glory what will my heart feel

will i dance for you jesus or in awe of you be still

will i stand in your presence or to my knees will i fall

will i sing hallelujah will i be able to speak at all

i can only imagine

i can only imagine

reason is incompetent to answer any fundamental question about god or morality or the meaning of life

to know myself as woman in the image of god to know god as mother and to know my own mother as a window into god these three are inseparableif one is implausible to the heart the other two are as well

all crosses had their tops cut and became ts there was also a thing called god

if thou really believe in one god

god is a kind of perpetual critique of instrumental reason

first and foremost god is the true hero of the story no matter how captivating the other characters may be our top priority is to discover what the bible reveals about god

the common element in all the special forms of contemplation is the loving yearning affirming bent toward that happiness which is the same as god himself and which is the aim and purpose of all that happens in the world

gods are but greater demons the cishaurim said hungers across the surface of eternity wanting only to taste the clarity of our souls can you not see this

i believe in a benevolent god not because he created the grand canyon or michelangelo but because he gave us snacks

what is the holiness of conversation

it is

to master death

is there any reward

im beginning to doubt it

i am broken and bored

is there any reward

and inform me about it

is there any reward

im beginning to doubt it

in the desert the only god is a well

if there is no personal godeverything is permissablel and if god existseverthing is possible

look there regina pointed toward the northern sky polaris

viktor looked up the constant north star one of man’s most dependable guides

polaris will be waiting for us there when we are old and have experienced a lifetime of joys and regrets regina said a wistful note in her voice that fact makes me feel like one of god’s most insignificant creatures

relinquishing selfish wants one is free to allow others to travel their own paths under the will of god

our crucifixes exhibit the pain but they veil perhaps necessarily the obscenity but the death of the godman was both

i must not like the quietists reduce all religion to a denial of any specific action despising all other means since what makes perfection is gods order and the means he ordains is best for the soul

a deep and even paranoid suspicion continues to disparage higher criticism of the bible as if someone could publish a paper that would unravel god p

i have taken all my good deeds and all my bad deeds and cast them … in a heap before the lord and fled from both and betaken myself to the lord jesus christ and in him i have sweet peace

bí ann nó as

and god looked upon the creation in all its delightful multiplicity and saw that all in all it was quite amiable

its the rare

god who needs less stroking that a rock

star or poetician

i can never feel that the illusion of life is a truth as long as any illusion reflects unreality however even an untruth is a truth in its turn

you have perhaps heard some false reports

on the subject of god he is not dead and he is not a fable he is not mocked nor forgotten

successfully god is a lion that comes in the night god is a hawk gliding among the stars

if all the stars and the earth and the living flesh of the night that flows in between them and whatever is beyond them

were that one bird he has a bloody beak and harsh talons he pounces and tears

and where is the german reich there also

will be prodigious america and worldowning china i say that all hopes and empires will die like yours

mankind will die there will be no more fools wisdom will die the very stars will die

between world and animal are fewer questions than between man and world how many such questions are there in gods word

who prays at help in the illusion of his life does not understand that his only aid is death

are we the wreck or the ship of gods word

the world of an animal is reduced to its perimeter human world is reduced to its perimeter but does the world of god have perimeters if it does then it is not infinite but if it doesn’t it means that this is not a world

why not why not anything if god ain’t a god of why nots than i say ‘why bother’ and i don’t think that’s takin his name in vain i think it’s tellin the truth about what people need

to talk about god except in the context of prayer is to take his name in vain

one may indeed talk to a child about god but this is on a par with telling him that he was brought to his mother by a stork

what distances can be explored without god

there are no names that do not desire fame because we come from god

the best existential analysis of the human condition leads directly into the problems of god and faith

what do you believe in’ asked david

no man  can be so stupid to deny that all men naturally were born free being the image and resemblance of god himself

wallace stevens turns to the idea of the weather precisely as the religious man turns to the idea of god

thine are these orbs of light and shade

thou madest life in man and brute

xas sighed but i dont want to talk about god why do i sometimes i feel god is all over me like a pollen and i go about pollinating things with god

sobran opened his eyes and xas smiled at him soban said i did think that you talked about god to persuade me you werent evil but ive decided that for you everything is somehow to the glory of god whether you like it or not

i feel that yes my imagination was first formed in gods glory but i think god didnt make the world so i think my feelings are mistaken

some men may be unready

for the coming of the genie

who grants three wishes

men didnt have any idea about regret

as moses threw whatever in his hand on the ground

so does hand should do what it can to earn miracles

gods image…is found not best in individual humans but in humans as they relate to each other

a solemn day barring a stay by sup ct  with my final nod utah will use most extreme power  execute a killer mourn his victims justice

go where thou wilt thou canst not go out of thy fathers ground

i wasted all of my

outrage on my fucking religion

it should have been wasted on god

when you share your problems with man you get mansized solutions when you share your problems with god you get godsized solutions

atheism is so senseless when i look at the solar system i see the earth at the right distance from the sun to receive the proper amounts of heat and light this did not happen by chance

life was never meant to be a race rather a journey—to be enjoyed with god and shared with those we love these are the things that make life meaningful leaving us satisfied rather than wanting

charity by principle that god will bless you in return is to give with a heart of greed rather than with a heart of love

not a single one of us in unimportant or unworthy for it really has little or nothing to do with us but everything to do with a love that will not let us go

you can’t believe in people the way you believe in god  because if you did you are inevitably perished

people are just people

and god is god

we give thanks to god for the priceless gift of grace

waking up

in a dream your mothers garden flourishes

and she smiles and never knows the taste of rot

in a dream you take god off the shelf shake the dirt from his shoulders

hes smaller than he once was you no longer tremble

in a dream kindness dances off your tongue

your silicone heart beating a song from your sisters piano

you see the world through rosewater eyes

in a dream the greenest shoot sprouts from the ash

how wonderful it is

that some things still believe in resurrection

that some things refuse to be destroyed

a mountain is not nearly as much a wonder as a mosquito

the impossible is not the place where we ran out of possibilities rather it’s the place where we ran out of faith

i came to the end of myself fighting to birth the beginning of a dream but what really brought me to the end of myself was that i was foolish enough to fight for a dream without including the god that had given it to me

when god opens doors for you no one can close those because he is a great god

little science takes you away from god but more of it takes you to him

sometimes god will allow you to lose battles so you can learn to lean on him and not on your own strength for he knows in him you are always a winner despite what is happening around you

we may be part of the universe but we aint no god

let us be dissatisfied until that day when nobody will shout white power — when nobody will shout black power — but everybody will talk about gods power and human power

god cares not what clothes we wear for they can neither show nor hide who we really are

evil exists doesn’t mean god doesn’t

i make messes god makes masterpieces and the difference is found in surrendering what i think i know to the god who knows without having to think

according to the bible the believers relationship with god is not instigated through selfrealization but rather through faith in jesus sacrificial death and resurrection from the dead

he is a personal god who wants to relate with human beings not just a force or an underlying principle or reality therefore the concept of the divine as it is often found within yoga is very unlike the god of the bible

one would have to lose ones wits to believe in a god and to become a complete imbecile to adore him

just when our understanding of god finally appears to have fallen comfortably into our childlike formulas god lets us know that he’s not two things a child or a formula

i am the solution as well

i am the defeated myself

i am the conqueror as well

i am the atheist myself

i am the believer as well

i am the life myself

i am the death as well

i am the god myself

i am the devil as well

the greatest treasure is reverence of god

the best gift god gave is family

but my sin was this that i looked for pleasure beauty and truth not in him but in myself and his other creatures and the search led me instead to pain confusion and error

redemption is the work of the righteous god

the just god is fair judge

the lawgiver is lord god

where there seems to be no way god will show you the way do not walk away from him

loving a desiring god is a fuller picture of a god who also yearns for our happiness our joy and yes even our pleasure

maybe the aliens have taken him too

todays religions where once books for education its just that people eventually forgot to get the knowledge from the books and started to pray it

people got creative creativity became stories stories became books books became religions characters became gods religions became differences differences limited the creativity in people

atheism has always been understood wrongly as much as they understood god itself

nothing can explain god and gravity

gravity is the god and the sun is the son of god as our ancestors tried to teach us they where scientists with unstoppable creativity

parents impart such invaluable ingredients as genetic code sanskaar and education … whereas the almighty god just hands out to us destiny … so life is just about bettering or be battered by destiny

the god of the philosophers disappeared behind the world because he was described in the third person and not addressed in the second

when god is enough for you the doors of heaven open wide

question everything until you find that common thread that unravels everything

to love god with all you heart all your mind and all your soul you must surrender all that you have all that you know and all that you are

there is only one pathand everyone is on it

who are the happiest people those who hear the word of god and obey they are happy to bend the knee happy to turn it over to god because they know it’s that or carry the weight of the world

most hidden yet most present

and just like the madness of a man who not knowing how to sail might take to the sea with no one to pilot him is the madness of a creature

who enters upon religious life without gods will to guide her

in the beginning was a moment in time and the moment was with god and the moment was god moment

the proper study of god is the nature of time

god was never closer to him never more real than when stephen spoke of god or when he remembered stephen speaking of god

he could hear fr stephen’s voice do not ask god to do for you what you can do for yourself

god doesnt hate you for what youve done wrong he loves you for what youre trying to do right

only god was able to create a free creature and freedom could only arise by the act of creation

aren’t you strong enough to walk alone we must each of us find god by ourselves

as we love god wish to see him develop a sense of belonging and work for him faith blossoms to produce refuge in him refuge is about leaving everything to god

being an atheist has its own benefits you can explore all the forms of gods without any reason to worship it

if egyptian pyramids where in india they would be temples and mummies would be prayed as gods

an atheist would not stand against any religion or worships but he rather helps you understand the science behind it

humans are capable of great discoveries and inventions and then give the credits to a god they barely discovered

i prayed to trees this was easier than praying directly to god there was nearly always a tree nearby

how in the world are we supposed to engage life when we spend all of our life building walls to protect ourselves from the very thing that we say we want to engage the answer is i think understanding that god doesn’t need walls but we need him

god is present in every process god is vibrating in every transformation now he is there now there is less of him but sometimes he is not there at all because god manifests himself even in the fact that he is not there

god has a special way of making dreams come true believe go for it and watch your dream become a reality

i firmly believe god is still in the business of miracles

a sinful lifestyle can blind you from seeing who you really are  a child of god

faith is firm believe in a faithful god

tell god all your troubles

trust in god at all times even in times of troubles

faith in god is a firm fortress

the sovereign lord is a supreme being

youre my reason in life youre my grace of god

god can multiply your blessings you just need to trust in him

me i want to move with my notsafebutgood god

it is the effects on the world of successful active germline replicators that we see as adaptations

shah jahan who proved

an emperor to be shorter than a lover

who turned a grave into a temple

who gave his beloved a place of god

and converted love into a prayer

the unseen god sees every secret deed

wearing things such as makeup and fake hair is some people’s subconscious way of showing god where they are adamant he made a mistake

god will always be god

he is a god of all nations throughout seasons there is no reason enough to refute his existence

if i really believe that my timing is perfect maybe the thing that’s perfect is my denial about my timing and if that’s the case maybe now is the perfect time to be honest about that

pain believes itself to be the force that pushes everyone away but god says that pain is the invitation that he could never throw away

what can man do without god where can man find life if not from god how can mankind survive if not for god who is the source of wisdom if not god

wisdom is from god anything outside of that is intellect

the gospel of god is the grace of salvation

we are workmanship of god

silver and gold belongs to god but he has given us the privilege to own it because he is a god of grace

when you are favoured by god nothing will make you fail even when there is failure written all over you will gracefully succeed

nature is the work of god

as i wait upon thee thou perfect thy work in me

he work in me to wait upon thee

i have full assurance in god what he promises he is able to bring to pass

if i am unable to believe that i am more than happenstance i have chosen to behave as a person of accident verses standing as a man of purpose

despite the illusions that i so readily embrace whatever i hold can’t be held for in time time will steal it away but time can’t hold god therefore of all the things around me my hands should be full of god and empty of everything else

god god    he’s just a good accountant with an eye on the debit as well as the credit column there has to be a balance one life is wasted another is born

god can restore your life trust in him

god remains the same regardless of the circumstances around you trust in him he is reliable all the time

when we make god the centre of our being it helps us realize that we are not lesser beings

although we are made in the image of god we cannot substitute who he is

i don’t want to say that i believe in god rather i want to live out my life like i believe in god because that takes the words that i choose not to say and it shouts them without ever saying them

if you are broke don’t pursue money pursue god your prosperity if you are faced with lack don’t pursue material goods pursue god your provider if you are sick don’t pursue the cure pursue god your healer

the problem with societal issues in general is nobody really wants a solution because the answer to the problem involves introspection based not by ones own subjective opinion but by the objective moral truth from god

day in and out season in and out in any city and any country god remains a great father

the love of god is ever shining everlasting and never failing he is a great god after all

the greatness of god alone is greater than the greatness of many great men combined

there is no one like god he is the greatest he is so good and so glorious

there is never a giant problem for a god so great

he has been god yesterday he is still god today and he will remain god tomorrow he is the allknowing and allmighty king

in life the greatness of god is often realized during the darkest hour of the night

god is bigger than you think and he can do better than you thought

god is unlimited by the limitations of humankind

god never stops doing wonders he has done wonderful things and he will keep on doing wonders

the battle is never fought alone even though we might feel alone in the fight for with god the feeling of being alone never supersedes the fact of his presence

when you put god in charge of your life no one can take you out of line

when god anoints you people will see it when he appoints you others will know it and when he uplifts you the world will hear it because he is able to do what is unheard of

when god anoints you surely you will be appointed for massive accomplishments

i have seen a world within a world within a world but never a world ending without another world

god never goes on vacation he never changes his decisions nor his location he is still the same great god regardless of human opinion

god has been great and he has done great things in our lives

god is teaching us something very meaningful – whether of the unexpected powers of endurance of those affected or the hidden depths of compassion of those who respond

god is the comforter in all circumstances

whatever trials we may encounter we can trust god to give us grace to triumph

speak to god about your situation

nysema oh he was beautiful as a god and innocent as a child

the kingdom of god is found within a man

the greatest need is gods grace

the grace of god restored a man to his glorious state

love is the force that holds the universe together literally without it matter would instantaneously fall apart we may replace the name love with god at any time for god is love

man passes from the work to the producer of the work and he sees that an allbeauteous maker wants to make himself known and acquainted through the miracles of his own art and he responds with knowledge and belief

the wildness of god is the sensuousness of god nature is the direct expression of the divine imagination it is the most intimate reflection of gods sense of beauty

like gods stray eyelashes

the stars are falling—more light more

god has no time to make a wish

all he can do is cry out faster faster

may god deliver us in the day of dark of evil moment

no other way is possible but agony but suffering says god says peters god says peter

look see the universe does nothing victim or monster there is no one to help  god is dead we should have tried to do our best without him

live your life by god’s principles not someone’s opinion or commentary

before you honor me make much of the one who made me for he is a writer without equal not in that he doesn’t rewrite but crafts characters that write their own lives

visit many books but live in the noble c h spurgeon

we knew the promise had never been safety or that bad things would not happen if we were good and virtuous the promise is only that god is in it with us no matter what it is

who am i who are we to questions the works of our lord for we are but mere mortals created by him and for him what life we call ours does not belong to us and it is grace that we be taken from this dark earth

genius is creating something and constructing within it the ability to build on itself in order to become what it was created to be and as a result of that very process never find an end to the creating

they say that believing in god can be hard but from where i’m standing that’s nothing compared to having to believe in myself yet the oddest thing of all is that god believes in me even if i don’t believe in either of us

islam isnt about ayats and hadiths and niches and lamps its about us all of us allah’s too big and too open for my islam to be small and closed

godliness is a great gain

the greatest thing is to love god

and god wept only

at dark windows so that no one ever knew

trust god to give you what you need when you need it if you get it too early you might misplace it

cleanliness is next to godliness but godliness is next to loneliness

god will not abandon you

if you know the pain of being abandoned it’s easy to believe that god may abandon you too he won’t it doesn’t matter how imperfect sinful obnoxious or undeserving you are he will not leave you deuteronomy

let your life be filled with the fruit of his spirit

if you do you are the most happiest man of god

on the other hand when i do something wrong sin i myself am the only responsible for i didnt allow god to take control

therefore i should trust only god and not me for whenever i insist to take control i do something wrong

trusting yourself is the opposite of trusting god if you trust god totally as you must you must mistrust yourself if you trust yourself you are automatically mistrusting god

faith is not enough you also need an act of will the act of will you need is precisely deciding to trust god fully and mistrust yourself

modern psychology has lost its bearings when they insist that one must trust oneself that position is unchristian

god is a miracle wonder worker

an idle brain is a devils workshop but an idle mind can be a gods one

true humility is agreeing with god about who you are

may you find comfort in all circumstances

ultimately what matters is the inward and invisible voices of our inner being because allsurpassing power lives within us

faith is to believe and knowledge is accomplished through death

god is not don santo

his expression made me think of oldtimey illustrations of god severely paternal bestowing the kind of love that weighs and measures before it find you worthy

reach into the darkness and pull out the light

there’s a difference between believing and knowing

the world waits on us for decisions must be made with impacts that flutter across time no series of events can come from more of a change in demeanor knowing —not thinking not believing but knowing —is what manifests reality

you drive that hate of love from one life to the next with no recourse regret nor redemption of your soul

learning to fear god gives way to no fear of anything else

keep them open to god your heart mind and soul because the floodgates are open and the water is out you just never know when grace will seep in

thank god i’m getting tired of working underground i feel like damn mole

faith is to suspect something is there and knowledge is to encounter it

god is in full measure in a man the quantity of emanation of god from the body depends upon the grace of god it is his sport and there is no control over it

redemption lies in the hands of a righteous god

the maker is a merciful god

god is the giver

god never gives up on you

at all times trust in god

there is salvation for sinners through the grace of god

without the mercy of the maker every man should have perish in his sins

seek what the lord requires of you

repent return to god

the lord turned away washing

his hands without soap and water

i asked for strength that i might achieve

i was made weak that i might learn humbly to obey

i asked for health that i might do greater things

i was given infirmity that i might do better things

i asked for riches that i might be happy

i was given poverty that i might be wise

i asked for power that i might have the praise of men

i was given weakness that i might feel the need of god

i asked for all things that i might enjoy life

i was given life that i might enjoy all things

i got nothing that i asked for

but everything that i had hoped for

almost despite myself my unspoken prayers were answered

i am among all men most richly blessed

we adults can be a wretched lot chika yet in every childs face we see the lord has not given up on us

god loved humans but humans loved themselves instead thats where all it began from

what a blessings god has bestowed upon us the breath of being

god realized that he had no concept of the skills required to run an organization of this magnitude

praying brings us to god s presence

faith is the fear of god

pray without ceasing to purify thyself in gods presence

no god no grace

without god there is no grace

a poets promise is kept by attention to detail every word is an opportunity to reveal the universal truth of gods love

enter my world and you will find what is in my heart

imagination to see beauty in the world which is barren to all but a few

tuesday makes gods love shine

god just isnt in you

hes in everything

let there be light said god  there was light

god is our graceful comforter

this is the verdict light has come into the world but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil everyone who does evil hates the light and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed

but whoever lives by the truth comes into the light so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of god

mortal man has always sought to reduce the infinite into the finite in order to understand it and in

doing so has missed the mark completely it was not until i could see with the help of modern science

the larger portion of the universe with all it’s myriad stars and galaxies that the enormity of god

jesus never gives up on you so dont give up on him dont be gods fairweather friend

without god there is no grace

heaven is where christmas came from and if we give it permission to do so someday it will take us back there with it

jesus died a criminal’s death surrounded by a handful of followers who refused to do anything other than a chase a god who through his death at that very moment was chasing them

on that first christmas morning the cries of this newborn were ignored by a world off to greater agendas from which this child would rise to save us

i don’t know what is more frightening a creature on a small planet worshipping itself and its world as if infinity did not exist or a creature who burns its fellow beings because the infinite does exist

he always hoped god would provide him with salvation someday he believed that everything he went through was a test of his faith

prayer serves as a reminder that you are not god

the way i understand things the bible may have been thought out by god but it was written down by men and like everything men write down such as the newspapers they got the main story right but some of the details wrong

do you desire redemption trust in the righteous god

sometimes i just sit and stare out of the window wondering what the world is going to do today and my prayer is that what the world does today is based on who god is every day

if god believes in you then it doesn’t matter if anyone else does and god has never not believed in you

pain led me to love

love led me to god

god showed me myself

for i have always been love

i believe that any god worth believing in believes in me too

satan plants questions in your mind and says ‘answer this with logic’ but god says ‘no answer with faith

disguised as a friend my thoughts waltz in asking if reason would like to dancelogic being a gentleman said nothing and i was fooled again

sensuality is the portal through which god permeates every aspect of our beings so he can express his absolute beauty passion and depth through us

we want the schedule for the next five years but god says take my hand lets just focus on doing the next right thing

the greatest treasure is awe reverence for god

think of it… not a moment is the same from one second to the next and that moment will never come again this is what the mind perceives of god… endless change time within changelessness eternity

has helped bring it home to me how fragile life is  and how necessary it is to concentrate on the essentials no matter what happens to you if you can draw strength from god and the people you love nothing can ever defeat you

i don’t care what men say about god what i care about is what god says about me

the divine grace of salvation leads to deliverance from sin

the gospel of salvation is to be saved from sin

faith in god is like a well watered garden

to do evil is to be an enemy of god

to do good is to be a friend of god

life is precious regardless of how you choose to think about it

the nature reveals itself how great and perfect god you are you are bright as the sunrise and more beautiful than the sunset unto you all the glory will be you are god of creation and lord of all mankind

do not waste the life god has given you

for centuries it was believed that disabled people like me were living under a curse that was inflicted by god i prefer to think that everything can be explained another way by the laws of nature

when we image borders we fail at imaging god

my heart believed even when my mind faltered i listened to my heart and i wrote a wrinkle in time as an affirmation that there was indeed light in the darkness with which i was surrounded i wrote it for god

broken expectations arent meant to crush our hopes but to free us to put our confidence in god alone they arent meant to make us give up but look up

my parting shot tonight let not politics engage you away from living it is through living that we find true joy and fulfilling life simple things in life define who god is in our lives

but failure to disprove something is not a good reason to believe it

i want to believe in a new thing lord i want that more than anything i want to forget the old things—the bad and ugly things that have sent me here please let me see your hand in all of this let me see the path through this wilderness

to choose joy does not mean to choose happy feelings or an artificial atmosphere of hilarity but it does mean the determination to let whatever takes place bring us one step closer to the god of life

everything depends on something the leaf depends on the tree the tree depends on the sun air and water they are only ‘part’ of the universe to depend on god is to know the same and be sublimely happy because of that knowledge

the right balance equal to a better life being grateful for god guidance help and support a balanced life includes love solitude meditation and peaceful surroundings

i stopped i had wanted to say what begins at that moment is poetry but zorba would not have understood so i kept silent

what begins asked zorba eagerly why did you stop

i had a passing thought i wondered if god might have been drunk when he created me then it dawned on meof course not he was just god being god and he knew exactly what he was doing and what the outcome would be

i will always love you but i am not god i will sometimes hurt you because i am not god

the lords will would be done all i had to do was follow his voice

in eternity there is no time for anything to begin or end therefore past present future represent a linear progression that goes nowhere

silence is autonomous it is beyond us our task is to coordinate our being with the greater being of silence

if i’d been born in ancient greece i’d worship zeus and aphrodite

the most confused kids are those who pray to god before their science exam

there are so many different faiths how do you know the holy book you have been brought up with is the true one and if all the others are wrong what makes you think your holy book isnt wrong too

it is our duty to pray for such an act brings us to the presence of the mighty god who desires to show mercy to all who call upon his holy name

all have problems but those who rely on god breathe easier how they don’t allow mistakes in the world to define who they are instead they lean on ‘what’ they are and the worries of the world bounce off them

god is dancing in our breath singing in our thoughts and celebrating in our dna when you understand that god fears evaporates and eternity arises

its impossible to fear and love god at the same time simply because you cant enter into heaven and hell at the same time

being accepted by god never meant being accepted by your peers

stop worrying about what others think about you stop judging god by the way people judge you

your worth is inherent not in question

the weird thing about the bible is that almost everything in it is a metaphor

so that’s also church right

i know this might seem blasphemous but my priest tells me its okay to ask questions even if they seem bizarre

planning is good irreverently waiting for something more when god gave you life and a dream today is not good

god uses people to block opportunities you should have considered in the first place

in the here and now out on the arctic ice i believe in a god not one i need to define worship or evangelize but the truth is undeniably palpable

our blessed lord was hopeful about humanity he always saw

men the way he originally designed them he saw through the surface grime and dirt to the real man underneath he never identified

a person with sin he saw sin as something alien and foreign which

did not belong to man sin had mastered man but he could be freed

from it to be his real self just as every mother sees her own image

and likeness on her child’s face so god always saw the divine image

and likeness beneath us

powerfully save yours back to him from which you came dont get lost in the deep details get loved

to trust god means to depend upon god this is the reason children are content they know deep down they are taken care of to lose this feeling is the great tragedy of life to find it again the greatest recovery

god uses people to block opportunities you should have never considered in the first place

that day and for a long time after shed grapple with gods injustice too but it was also a long time before she learned that god needed an indestructible person for the tasks that lay ahead and this is how theyre forged

ways to approach a joyful life

life is short so don’t pretend like you’ll have time later⁣

design your work so have freedom of geography income and time⁣

don’t care about stuff ⁣

own your life⁣

own your time⁣

own your contribution to humanity on a deep level⁣

be cool kind to other people⁣

don’t take yourself too seriously⁣

bonus bad stuff will happen move forward and don’t blame god for the bad stuff

the sad news is those born into poverty usually remain in poverty the good news is these people are among the first to turn to god the pain of life has made them seek for something better when they find it they are no longer poor

god should be welcomed in the heart and not in the act of worship alone

the world is full of mysteries strange unapproachable overpowering mysteries that you cannot read trust trust in the power and in the wisdom and in the goodness of him the almighty one who rules it

the heart is the throne of god and the heart is the mother of all the desires

the world is full of mysteries strange unapproachable overpowering mysteries that you cannot read trust trust in the power and in the wisdom and in the goodness of him the almighty one who rules

the ubiquitous eyes of god may identify one as a supplyroute and strategically maneuver his placing he never leaves wanting any through whom he chooses to bless others

that ‘god will provide’ is a sanguine statement laced with faith he does not bring one out in the dark and switch off the light

the love of god is so hot than a burning coal it burns the heart and warms the chest while at the same time calming the mind like still water

you have such a big heart you care so deeply for your angels and you love every single thing you create you want to share your love you

it is all the dance it is all god

those who choose god have god

dont hesitate to ponder the next time you catch a glimpse of the sky it takes only a few seconds to see what the eyes cannot because did you ever ask yourself that while we may not have eyes why do we all have a heart

if you start understanding the god or say power of the universe it’s conscious and knowledge

if you start praying every stones in the name of same god it’s foolishness

if you worship anything by realizing them its faith

seeking is fundamental accomplishment to human life

dont over intellectualize that which is the love of god just be

god so loved the world that he gave his son to that world that those who put their confidence in him would not lead a miserable failing existence but have eternal life which is the kind of life god has

every time i take my clothes off i stop believing in you

choose this day whom you will serve as for me and my house we will serve the lord

god as an idea is limited by human comprehension

god as a person is infinitely more sophisticated than our best example of a good fair moral and ethical human

god as an image would be the idea that imagination under the proper constraints or laws will produce the most value

god has an inordinate fondness for stars and beetles

love of god he said slowly searching for words is not always

the same as love of good i wish it were that simple we know what

is good it is written in the commandments but god is not

contained only in the commandments you know they are only an
