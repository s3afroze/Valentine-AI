and through gentleness of speech

don’t command except as is fitting

what he wishes should be done for him

when he turns his face back to you after raging

there will be peace from his ka

as ill will comes from opposition

so goodwill increases love

teach the great what is useful to him

be his aid before the people

if you set his knowledge impress his lord

your sustenance will come from his ka

as the favorites belly is filled

so your back will be clothed by it

which came to you as gift of god

so that you will not fall behind one like you

the instruction of ptahhotep

the fool who does not hear

he can do nothing at all

he sees knowledge in ignorance

he does all that one detests

and is blamed for it each day

he lives on that by which one dies

his food is distortion of speech

his sort is known to the officials

who say a living death each day

one passes over his doings

because of his many daily troubles

a son who hears is a follower of horus

it goes well with him when he has heard

when he is old has reached veneration

he will speak likewise to his children

renewing the teaching of his father

he will speak to the children

so that they will speak to their children

set an example don’t give offense

if justice stands firm your children will live

as to the first who gets into trouble

when they see it people will say

that is just like him

and will say to what they hear

that’s just like him too

to see everyone is to satisfy the many

riches are useless without them

don’t take a word and then bring it back

don’t put one thing in place of another

beware of loosening the cords in you

listen if you want to endure in the mouth of the hearers

speak after you have mastered the craft

if you speak to good purpose

conceal your heart control your mouth

then you will be known among the officials

be quite exact before your lord

act so that one will say to him he’s the son of that one

and those who hear it will say

blessed is he to whom he was born

be deliberate when you speak

so as to say things that count

then the officials who listen will say

how good is what comes from his mouth

act so that your lord will say of you

how good is he whom his father taught

when he came forth from his body

he told him all that was in his mind

and he does even more than he was told

lo the good son the gift of god

exceeds what is told him by his lord

he will do right when his heart is straight

as you succeed me sound in your body

the king content with all that was done

may you obtain many years of life

not small is what i did on earth

i had one hundred and ten years of life

as gift of the king

honors exceeding those of the ancestors

by doing justice for the king

until the state of veneration

the instruction of ptahhotep

instruction of the mayor of the city the vizier ptahhotep under the majesty of king isesi who lives for all eternity the mayor of the city the vizier ptahhotep said

o king my lord

age is here old age arrived

childtike one sleeps all day

eyes are dim ears deaf

strength is waning through weariness

the mouth silenced speaks not

the heart void recalls not the past

the bones ache throughout

good has become evil all taste is gone

what age does to people is evil in everything

the nose clogged breathes not

painful are standing and sitting

may this servant be ordered to make a staff of old age

so as to teil him the words of those who heard

the ways of the ancestors

who have listened to the gods

may such be done for you

so that strife may be banned from the people

and the two shores may serve you

said the majesty of this god

instruct him then in the sayings of the past

may he become a model for the children of the great

may obedience enter him

and the devotion of him who speaks to him

no one is born wise

don’t be proud of your knowledge

consult the ignorant and the wise

the limits of art are not reached

no artist’s skills are perfect

good speech is more hidden than greenstone

yet may be found among maids at the grindstones

if you meet a disputant in action

a powerful man superior to you

fold your arms bend your back

to flout him will not make him agree with you

make little of the evil speech

by not opposing him while hes in action

he will be called an ignoramus

your selfcontrol will match his pile of words

if you meet a disputant in action

who is your equal on your level

you will make your worth exceed his by silence

while he is speaking evilly

there will be much talk by the hearers

your name will be good in the mind of the magistrates

if you meet a disputant in action

a poor man not your equal

do not attack him because he is weak

let him alone he will confute himself

do not answer him to relieve your heart

do not vent yourself against your opponent

wretched is he who injures a poor man

one will wish to do what you desire

you will beat him through the magistrates’ reproof

if you are a man who leads

who controls the affairs of the many

seek out every beneficent deed

that your conduct may be blameless

unchallenged since the time of osiris

one punishes the transgressor of laws

though the greedy overlooks this

yet crime never lands its wares

in the end it is justice that lasts

man says it is my fathers ground

do not scheme against people

if a man says i shall live by it

he will lack bread for his mouth

if a man says i shall be rich

he will have to say my cleverness has snared me

if he says i will snare for myself

he will be unable to say i snared for my profit

if a man says i will rob someone

he will end being given to a stranger

people’s schemes do not prevail

god’s command is what prevails

live then in the midst of peace

what they give comes by itself

consciousness flows where life grows love is the seed that lets it blossom

having seen all this you can choose to look the other way but you can never say again i did not know

you dont need to know or do very much to enjoy being alive

the most difficult obstacle i the search for knowledge is ourselves

peace without knowledge of the cause of that peace is still ignorance

wisdom requires both a way of thinking and acquisition of a body of knowledge gained through such thinking as well as the personal ability to apply accumulated knowledge to life

a great moment is made when knowledge can be shared not disputed fought over opposed or contested as to which version or perspective is greater worthier or more valuable

the paramount reason for unhappiness and fear is due to our relationship with the content of our existence and more so our lack of awareness to life

every moment of life is by true definition the first and the last of our human existence how do you wish to live this one moment in life

energy is manifesting universally and this is ongoing the now of this moment is everlasting and so are we awareness is the key that can set you free

are you often confused anxious or frightened the reason is because you are much more than what the mind wants you to think or believe

you are capable of so much beauty and this extends out into the universe

it may be beneficial for mind and conscious development to be in this world but remember we are not of this world this is a journey of selfdiscovery that is traveled and experienced by going inward to the source of consciousness

writing is discovering what you dont know

the universe contains all of the knowledge that is available and if we think about it we are a part of that universe and not separate

your focus on only motivation instead of expanding your reach and knowledge through education communication and comprehension is the reason for stagnation in your forward motion

segregation and separation can be a good thing

the person collecting money for your cannabusiness should not be the one that is in charge of doing the receivables or doing the reconciliations

segregate and separate those three tasks to three different people

person   collects the money

person   invoices for the money

person   reconciles the money

this allows for lesser chances of collusion lesser chances of people walking with money and lesser chances of being fined or penalized by the state

some things are made funny to some people by their ignorance

it is a common illusion to believe that what we know today is all we ever can know nothing is more vulnerable than scientific theory which is an ephemeral attempt to explain facts and not an everlasting truth in itself

you discover nothing you only learn of

what you have been ignorant of so far

a wellwritten article does not make what was written factual or something to subscribe to

fiction does not become fact because it looks good

fiction does not become fact because you wish it were true

fiction does not become fact because it has turned into popular opinion

remember this before reading the news views opinions or commentary

nicky knew so many beautiful things

the knowledge qualified from a mentor rewards a certificate conversely knowledge learned from time and circumstances crowns wisdom and experience indeed it reigns supreme

take it all in but do the due diligence vetting and fact checking before you buy into the hype that may be truly popular but is entirely false

fear grew in places unlit by knowledge

what is the proof that i know something most certainly not my saying i know it

being told that you have not changed is not always a compliment

comfort zones are overrated when you embrace the unfamiliar and uncomfortable in all areas of life your progress will start soaring

doubt is the necessary tool of knowledge

unfortunately most people need to know a lot of what they do not know to know how little they know

they say a true king considers the advice of counsel but always follows his heart

just like a great warrior he is not the soldier that fights all the time but one that knows when to fight and when to fly hide

same goes for a wise man he doesnt just know what to say or do but also knows when where why how and to whom he speaks or acts

strength doesn’t lie in numbers and power is not a function of muscles weapons don’t bring peaceful slumbers nor wealth a guarantee of good health

maturity is not directly proportional to age and slavery does not necessarily mean being locked up in a cage

it takes courage to serve with reliance and grace to face your mistakes without defiance

he that is down need fear no fall as a dog destined to be lost will never hear the hunters call

wisdom – wise domain – is a realm to attain a kingdom to reign in not just some impulse or sensation

a man can never be slave to the knowledge he has nor the understanding he applies and therein lies his wisdom

wisdom builds understanding establishes and knowledge fills with wealth

the wealth of knowledge is understanding and the knowledge of understanding is wisdom

just because we should know better doesnt mean we do

conservatives are therefore fully justified in legitimizing their opposition to radical knowledge in terms of happiness ultimately knowledge makes us unhappy

childrens as good as rithmetic to set you findin out things

i would like to think that people are capable of rational thought and of living in a rational manner but there has been study after study that demonstrates that thats not likely

human eyes have not yet reached as far as they can go with a telescope nor have they seen everything there is to see with a microscope

the right words are always there if a mans sharp enough to see them

the ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to convey it to another

no matter how much you know

if you don’t know who you are

where you are

and from where you came from

its marvelous to know another persons entire literary canon by heart its like knowing their secret personal language

instinct is something which transcends knowledge

knowing something in your head and knowing it deep down where fear lives are two different things

the emptiest people are full of themselves

every one has eyes but only handfull of people see

knowledge is like an everflowing stream of water and where you stop to drink from it is where you will become quenched

information was the best weapon she could have

the only things you take to heaven with you are the relationships you build here on earth

was it wisdom was it knowledge was it once more the deceptiveness of beauty so that all ones perceptions half way to truth were tangled in a golden mesh

so i come from a different approach where like i dont know whats going on im trying to work it out with other people and i want the freedom to be able to explore

you can’t change the world if the world doesn’t know who you are

our highest knowledge is that we have come forth from the divine pure and unblemished containing a sacred and bottomless well of love and capacity for joy

provide tremendous value to as many people as possible and you will attract blessings into your life

i pray that you must have peace within yourself

have you seen yourself lately you are always angry

busy fighting you are fighting everything  fighting everyone

first you had valid good reasons why you should be fighting

i pray that you have peace within yourself

a single strike parts a champion from a corpse

the room was a magpienest of pickedat knowledge the lair of a tinkerer to whom the universe was one vast toyshop of intriguing side issues

extra knowledge adds no value unless you put it into action or share it with others

then she wants to say that oh christ of course she knows the condescension europeans shower on americans is not always warranted shes a novelist which is tantamount to being a onewoman card catalogue for useless knowledge

knowledge like tasty food should be chewed enjoyed and swallowed a little each time when we feel full the time to stop is up how much we get counts more than how many pages we read

she dances

she dances around the burning flames with passion

under the same dull stars

under the same hell with crimson embers crashing

under the same silver chains that wires

all her beauty and who she is inside

shes left with the loneliness of human existence

shes left questioning how shes survived

shes left with this awakening of brutal resilience

her true beauty that she denies

as much shes like to deny it

as much as it continues to shine

that she doesnt even have to admit

because we all know its true

her glory and success

after all shes been through

her triumph and madness

and yet

she stands

broken legs but shes still standing

still dancing in this void

you must wonder how shes still dancing

you must wonder how shes not destroyed

she doesnt even begin to drown within the flames

but little do you realize

within these chains

she weeps and she cries

but she still goes on

and just you thought you could stop her

you thought youd be the one

well let me tell you because you thought wrong

nothing will ever silence her

because i know

i know that she is admiringly strong

the triumph of her song

shes shining bright like a ruby

reflecting in the golden sand

shes shining brighter like no other

shes far more than human or man

and yet

she stands

she continues to dance with freespirit

even though shes locked in these chains

though she never desired to change it

even throughout the agonizing pain

throughout all the distress

anxiety depression tears and sorrow

she still dances so beautify in her dress

she looks forward to tomorrow

not because of a fresh start but a new page

despite being trapped in her cage

she still smiles after being beaten so brutally

a smile that could brighten anyones day

shes so much more than anyone could ask for

shes so much more than i could ever say

shes a girl absolutely everyone should adore

she never gets in the way

even after her hearts been broken

even after the way she has been treated

after all these severe emotions

after all all the blood shes bled

and yet

she stands

even if sometimes she wonders why shes still here

she wonders why shes not dead

but theres this one thing that had been here throughout every tear

throughout the blazing fire leaving her cheeks cherry red

everyday this thing has given her a place to exist

this thing person these people

like warm sunlight it had so softly kissed

the apples of her cheeks

even when shes feeling feeble

always there at her worst and at her best

because of you and all the other people

she has this thing deep inside her chest

that she will cherish forever

even once youre gone

because today she smiles like no other

even when the sun sets at dawn

because today is the day

she just wants you to remember

in dark and stormy weather

it gets better

and after what shes been through she knows

throughout the highs and the lows

because of you and all others

after crossing the seas

she has come to understand

you have formed this key

this key to free her from this land

this endless gorge that swallowed her

her and other men

she had never knew nor had she planned

that because of you

and yet

this very day

she dances

even in the rain

knowledge does not mean meagre savoir faire of facts figures and information as any dullard can know by contrast it alludes to profound understanding owing to the fact that comprehension strengthens faith and broadens the vision of a believer

if you knew better youd do better if you didntyou didnt

no one knows enough to tell anyone else how to live

some people are not brave but ignorant of the danger they are in

knowledge that can be imparted loudly and with passion always lasts longer than knowledge that has to be whispered

the father made men curious some say to test our faith it is my own abiding sin that whenever i come upon a door i must needs see what lies upon the farther side but certain doors are best left unopened

i love keeping an open mind its liberating to know the universe and our existence are not limited to my understanding

it is unfortunate that it is possible to know something that is not true

in walking with god it’s not about knowing the facts rather it’s about knowing the god who knows the facts

not knowing how to get what you want is better than knowing how to get what you do not want

miss kirwin proved bailey right he had told me once that all knowledge is spendable currency depending on the market

you think you know something until the day you are different

when you treat your business or dream like a living breathing baby… you’ll make better decisions and wiser choices

stop shortcutting second guessing and buying into the unproven hype

your dreams deserve more

get certified a certificate easily moves you at least thousand rows ahead of other job candidates with similar knowledge

it is not everyone who dies that actually lived and of those who live only a few are alive

those who live get to make a living from doing what they love or dont love to do

but those who are alive they give to make a life from being who they were meant to be

so live know do and get  if you only want to make a living

but be alive be wise become and give  if you really want to make a life

everybody and their mother has a book and a podcast these days instead of telling people to check it out like everyone else already does

give them reasons to check it out tell them what your content is about why you are sharing it and who would like it engage

if you have the knowledge then keep it it will help you when youll need it

we have all the answers it is the questions we do not know

nothing puts a greater obstacle in the way of the progress of knowledge than thinking that one knows what one does not yet know

the dignities of unas will not be taken from him

for he has swallowed the knowledge of every god

unass lifetime is forever his limit is eternity

their spirits are before unas as broth of the gods

cooked for unas from their bones

among the living in this land for all eternity

education is not the acquisition of degrees it is the broadening of ones mind it is the process of undertaking and imparting true knowledge it is the awakening of ones consciousness towards the universe within us and the universe around us

i had no inkling as to what thoughts swarmed his mind be he didnt seem pleased knowledge indeed was dangerous

with all our science and philosophy we still really know nothing about life

knowledge may be power but money buys both

the narrow path to wisdom is better than the wide road to ignorance

hes going for wisdom but the real wisdom is knowing there sometimes isnt any

learn something new and teach another person something you know thats how life thrives progresses and continues knowledge is what makes us who we are the more experience and skills we have and share the better persons we become

it has been my experience that most problems in life are caused by a lack of information many people just dont know the things they need to know some ignore the truth others never understand it

birth of a question is the beginning of education

the majority of people who acquire wisdom do so after they have passed the age of forty prior to that time the majority of people are too busy gathering knowledge and organizing it into plans to spend any effort seeking wisdom

showing off or bragging does not showcase authority or ability

sharing your knowledge and experience without trying to sell yourself sends a greater message of engagement and authenticity

wrong assumptions occur from limited knowledge a person should have a complete view before shaping an opinion about someone or something

we know more about the lives of celebrities than the truth hidden in our wars

there is always more to know more to see more to learn the world is vast and wondrous strange and there are more things beneath the stars than even the archmaesters of the citadel can dream

in a time when truth is very much in peril books remain the ultimate repository of creative ideas and irreplaceable knowledge

we think that our minds are all powerful but in reality they’ve evolved to do what we need to do like hunt eat and talk to one another

so the concepts in our head are designed to deal with animals trees rivers and people

there’s no reason why they should be able to deal with atoms or galaxies but i believe we’re flexible and our minds are curious so we can change our thinking

it appears to me the doing what little one can to increase the general stock of knowledge is as respectable an object of life as one can in any likelyhood pursue

if you are

saying the same things as everyone else…

sharing the same links as everyone else…

posting the same quotes as everyone else…

and putting up the same pictures as everyone else…

why should anyone think you are any different than everyone else

i chose to

float in contentment and forgive all the deep pains

accept the shadows of my queer past

encounter faith and that magic love from within

enrich my spirit with graceful emotions of who i am

listen to the essence of life and collect its charm

cultivate the fascinating practice of spiritual wellbeing

excerpted from mindfulness chapter resilience

things only have the value and importance we give them this is as true of works of art as it is of knowledge or love or money

interpretation gives knowledge value but it must evolve as new knowledge emerges from a myriad incomplete truth a greater whole

not all statements that are truthful are useful

an opinion is a poor substitute for understanding

we can fail to know because we do not want to know  because what would be known would require us to believe and act in ways contrary to what we want

so much the worse for the wood if it finds that it has become a violin and i feel nothing but contempt for those ignoramuses who argue over things that they know nothing about

wars are bad for trade

while doing research a researcher tries to fill up gaps but also unknowingly creates gaps the later researchers tries to fill that specific gaps and adds something new to the existing knowledge such is the beauty of ‘research’

getting high only made me think of you more

i want to be your lighthouse

no matter how many dreams change

i want to be built upon rock

weathered by storms

smoothed out by the sea

with jagged edges only you know

and never loved you more

then with your closed eyes

telling my shirt that home was not full of sights

but only full of soul

people who possess a thirst for knowledge are keen observers and possess a compassionate heart hold the requisite key for learning and sharing their knowledge with other people

the architecture of our brains was born from the same trial and error the same energy principles the same pure mathematics that happen in flowers and jellyfish and higgs particles

viewed in this way our human aesthetic is necessarily the aesthetic of nature

viewed in this way it is nonsensical to ask why we find nature beautiful

beauty and symmetry and minimum principles are not qualities we ascribe to the cosmos and then marvel at in their perfection

they are simply what is just like the particular arrangement of atoms that make up our minds

we are not observers on the outside looking in we are on the inside too

instead of speaking and writing majority needs to learn and understand first

not knowing how venom kills does not take away the usefulness of knowing that it does

history is one way in which a society recognizes

and develops a mass of documentation with which it is inextricably linked

and then there is the third kind of secret the most hidden kind a secret no one knows about perhaps it was known once but was taken to the grave or maybe it is a useless mystery arcane and lonely unfound because no one ever looked for it

that’s your problem you’ll be screwed up by those who have the same opinions as you and by those who have the opposite opinions

writing the story plan protection and process based on the authenticity validity and authority of a business creates the soundest foundation to build a business on

with all the changes in business many of the global standard operating procedures of yesterday no longer apply to today’s modern business world

by directing without assumption and validating with fact…

by avoiding the hype and digging into the proof of concept…

and by vetting and double checking for the facts and fiction…

you can move past the false messaging to find the authentic routes for your vision

man’s major problem is not that he lacks potentials neither is it that he lacks solutions but man’s major problem is that he lacks knowledge of what he is truly capable of

nature was beautiful and i felt in tune with the universe like every single decision i had made had brought me to here to the glowing now and here is such a beautiful place to be

all the joints and drinks in the world could only serve to remind me i imagine myself being gatsby watching the party that i have thrown to get to where i am a future where there is a something where i am better where i am something

she left me ravenous and wishing upon fireflies for more limbs as puzzle pieces we fit together

if you have the strength walk alone

if you have the guts show your result

we have a leadership crisis in our world today it is based on the reality that we have developed leaders who care more about what people think about them or how they are seen than they care about those that follow them

i realize that in giving birth managing a household raising a child and composting potato peels in a city i have learned some things about wildness that even thoreau could not have known

and when i think of my few acquisitions i have to admit how fiercely the autodidact struggles for her education and how incomplete that education remains how illusory is any accumulation of knowledge

the feeling has knowledge whereas the knowledge has not the feeling similarly an academic evaluates with knowledge while an ordinary reader praises with the feeling

if you intend to evaluate how your knowledge is applicable transfer it to others

real education opens up the mind to the vast world of possibilities and potential

read what i write and like what you read

yes surprising isn’t it he said    you’d think everyone would ask for what they want and there’d be hundreds of tailors catering to specification but most people don’t know what they want

think not i say these things in order that you may say the one to the other he praised us well he saw but the good in us

i only speak to you in words of that which you yourselves know in thought

and what is word knowledge but a shadow of wordless knowledge

your thoughts and my words are waves from a sealed memory that keeps records of our yesterdays

and of the ancient days when the earth knew not us nor herself

and of nights when earth was upwrought with confusion

wise men have come to you to give you of their wisdom i came to take of your wisdom

the only certain barrier to truth is the presumption that you already have it

we are closest to real knowledge when were closest to understanding our own bodies

we cannot do for others what they’re unwilling to do for themselves

all the things you want and need in life are through the door marked ‘wisdom’

when you pursue wisdom you will soon realize how much you don’t know your knowledge will be incomplete but continually developing through your curiosity

progress daily in your own uncertainty

with confidence you have won before you have started

so never get diverted from your path that ultimately opens the doors of true success

cornspike learned by absorbing things from the outside to the inside

music is beyond knowledge as feeling is

if you receive a ‘certified’ message in a bottle with an audit notice be sure to have the most complete records and do not forget those receipts before the irs boards your vessel for inspection

knowledge cannot be inherited nor can it simply be gifted

dont act your role be yourself

not knowing is ok not wanting to know is idiocy

i’ve realized people can live in a world they’ve personally constructed through a distorted lens of guilt and shame whether they deserve it or not

we need all types of knowledge why not expand our circle of information

success doesnt lead to happiness happy people are more successful therefore happiness is not a result to be attained through action but a fact to be realized through knowledge

if knowledge is the ammunition of reform experience is the wick to ignite it

the autonomy of life is known throughout the universe

never shut out the natural curiosity your mind has life wants you to continually expand upon your knowledge base you will be surprised the few secrets people keep and will give up with an innocentlyframed question

the great tragedy is that knowledgeeven incompletecomes late

all answers to why are information all answers to how are knowledge

the relation to the world such as it tirelessly announces itself within us is not something that analysis might clarify philosophy can simply place it before our eyes and invite us to take notice

if you

say the same things as everyone else…

share the same links as everyone else…

post the same quotes as everyone else…

and put up the same pictures as everyone else…

why should anyone think you are any different than everyone else

you have your own creativity you have your own story

stop trying to tell another person’s story and start engaging people with yours

human life is infinitesimally small to grasp the knowledge of the entire universe

if you knew how much time you had you would be  following your souls callingand it would definitely manifest

poison is not merciful towards people who have consumed it unknowingly

worthlessness frequently nullifies humility because people who feel unworthy generally don’t do anything that leads them to be modest about

the library is dangerous—

don’t go in if you do

you know what will happen

it’s like a pet store or a bakery—

every single time you’ll come out of there

holding something in your arms

those novels with their big eyes

and those nononsense all muscle

greyhounds and dobermans

all nonfiction and business

cuddly when they’re young

but then the first page is turned

the doughnut scent of it all knowledge

the aroma of coffee being made

in all those books something for everyone

the deli offerings of civilization itself

its concrete and wood and glass covers

keeping within them the very big

very long story of everything

how it is possible to learn anything if you you feel that you know everything

the world even the smallest parts of it is filled with things you don’t know

in a sense the media is a moving potemkin village of understanding constantly adapting and reconstructing afterthefact

those who know more can easily understand that they actually know so little

we need affection and tenderness to grow more than knowledge and ideas

nowadays focusing on transferring applicable knowledge is a very challenging task that all teachers face

the peace of god is the greatest gift on earth

science gives us the ability to pull back the skin of life

and reveal the truth of things it allows us to understand

evil lodges too easily in mens hearts

what will happen if they assume the power to create life

most of the beautiful things in the world are done effortlessly

while facts do kill ignorance ignoring facts does not kill them

i think perhaps that i begin to understand how much i do not know

i see many more successes and wins from those working to be better over those trying to be the best

remove the hype the hate and the ego in your growth to truly grow to your potential and beyond

only through knowing could a person become strong

why refuse to investigate when knowledge of reality enables mastery of reality and if not mastery at least the stature of an honest amateur

a freedom of religion and faith

a freedom from discrimination

a freedom to share life with others and not judge

its time we changed that and become who we were meant to be

there is no better way to find out the true heart honor and professionalism of a person than seeing how they handle themselves and others when facing a crisis disaster or intense level of pressure

your knowledge of failure is the way for the new phase of it

every woman is a science for he that plods upon a woman all his life long shall at length finde himself short of the knowledge of her

if you cannot buy yourself a coat buy yourself a book latter your book will buy you a coat knowledge is only available for the wise

we rely on our education on our judgment and our intuition to make decisions but sometimes we find ourselves in the most dangerous scenario we can be in as individuals or as team when we don’t know that we don’t know but we believe we do know

i wish you were small again so i could hold you in my arms and comfort you but you are grown and you know that for some things there is no comfort

for it is not needful to use a common proverb that one should drink up the ocean who wishes to learn that its water is salt

we can only transform our lives by renewal of mind via renewed knowledge

a short while ago i foolishly thought i could learn everything  all the knowledge in the world now i hope only to be able to know of its existence and to understand one grain of it

it is more important that we listen to others than to always be speaking for in that way we learn what there is to know we should be easy to talk to and grateful for new information

people should know only what they need to know

knowing leads to caring

people suffering from insecurity and intellectual deficiency thrive on constant vilification rarely engaging in a communication based on sound reasoning

acquiring knowledge through the centuries has influenced human society more than all other factors

what do i know about life what does a windmill know about the wind

knowledge alone benefits no one unless the person acquiring it does something with it and great ideas are worthless unless they are implemented

…the more things you know or pretend to know the more powerful you are it doesn’t matter if things are true what counts remember is to possess a secret

what matters is not the facts but how you discover and think about them

knowledge is just a foundation the whole point of a foundation is to build on it

a good understanding is to keep the great law

i was wellread but perhaps that only made me stupid

the greatest knowledge ever created is the one created when one is challenged or criticized by hisher subordinate creativity lies in challenges and criticisms

look how far we have come

then the fight was to save the libraries to save knowledge and today the fight is to save the weapons to save power

the only good knowledge is the knowledge of god

true knowledge makes a man reject the wrong  by chosen what is right

knowledge perpetuates luck and luck perpetuates knowledge

given the opportunity of earthschool enrollment  some are humble enough to learn and grow stubborn enough to fail and repeat and wise enough to graduate and never return

put your ears to the ground to the sky to the sun and the moon tune in to mother earths sweet song she has messages to say knowledge to relay inspiration to convey there is much for you to learn your journey has just begun

what should be boundless is ones love of life not ones love of art or knowledge

when socrates said he knew nothing he still thought he knew more than anyone else

im everything that youre not

a philosophers main task is to compulsively filibuster

choosing comfort over knowledge is a sign of a weak mind

the greatest knowledge is the knowledge of god

anyone with a form of godliness is promoting ungodliness whether ignorantly or knowingly

is there any knowledge that refreshes the soul renew the spirit and restored the body like the study of the holy scriptures

an hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour but through knowledge shall the just be delivered

education without the knowledge of the holy one is the darkest doom

without the knowledge of god we are in complete darkness

without the knowledge of god we perish

for lack of knowledge of the holy one we perish in sin of hell

ignorance is the darkest depths

uthlubul ilma walau bisshin meaning seek knowledge even if it’s as far as china

knowledge is like nur a ray of light and light cannot come and be in a dark place because of that clean your hearts and your minds so that light can come touch and brighten your soul

uthlubul ilma minal mahdi ila lahdi seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave

the holy knowledge is the fear of god

the fear of god is the beginning of knowledge

the truest knowledge is the fear of god

on a basic level everything we say essentially anything that comes out of our mouths is a rationalisation in some form or another

b e h a v i o u r is sometimes greater than knowledge because in life there are many situations where knowledge failsbut behaviour can handle e v e r y t h i n g

no isolamento

the people of the light loves the light of knowledge

we awaken by asking the right questions

fail soon so that you can succeed sooner

today it is cheaper to start a business than tomorrow

you are just

you are not just for the right or left

but for what is right over the wrong

you are not just rich or poor

but always wealthy in the mind and heart

you are not perfect but flawed

you are flawed but you are just

you may just be conscious human

but you are also a magnificent

among other possibilities money was invented to make it possible for a foolish man to control wise men a weak man strong men a child old men an ignorant man knowledgeable men and for a dwarf to control giants

there is nothing morally wrong with buying stolen goods unless you know that they were stolen

a good man shares his knowledge selflessly with everyone

a man has only so much knowledge as he puts to work

its like killing each other is the only thing we know how to do

to not know what to do during the vacations is just a proof that society and the school system has stolen your life from you

this ignorance of what to do with time is the number one reason why people get bored so easily when alone with nothing to do

the world gives a way to the man who knows where he is going

if you know what the treasure of time is worth if you know that time is a resource then you will actually be able to convert your time into any product you want

the secret of all greatness is knowing what to do with time

solitude allows you to sit down and work out a system that works best for you

our world is filled with people who have only a shallow knowledge of certain skills and have remained like that for so many years without selfimprovement

most people have not become better than they were five years ago because people hardly invest time into improving their knowledge skills and talents

you must arrest every passing time and convert it into growing your knowledge and prowess in that chosen field of influence

it is a pity that dead men are still impacting the world while men who are still alive are wasting away roaming the world without an understanding of what to do with their time

god can make a cow out of a tree but has he ever done so therefore show some reason why a thing is so or cease to hold that it is so

knowledge is the most powerful weapon

one act of a kind deed is better than thousand words of knowledge

the more diseases you know about the sicker you are

if we read the holy scripture we shall grow in our knowledge of jesus christ the saviour and be filled with the fullness of god

let us reason according to the scriptures

don’t live your life not to know what to do with your time if you don’t have any results to show for all your passing time then you must have been trivializing time and you must have been living your life carelessly

the proof that most people don’t know how to measure their life by converting time into products is reflected in what they do with their free vacation time

our world is structured in such a way for you not to even know and for you not to even be told and for you not to even think about it that your life is disappearing gradually and that you are left only with very little life and time

the reason why one man is great and another man is living in mediocrity is simply because one understood the value of time while the other did not

your resources could go to where your hands could not reach

the majority of people on earth are ignorant of what their time should be used for

your voice could go to where your feet could not go

believe that your life is not ordinary and never look down on what you can do to impact a life

look up and hook up to a life of significance and don’t look down on yourself

when you live in darkness you live under the rulership of the devil

as long as you are ready to pay this price for living in the light knowledge the darkness ignorance becomes a servant to you

selfdiscovery is the key to knowing what to do with your life

to break yourself loose from the dominion rulership and manipulation of the devil you have to embrace light knowledge

we can choose to live under the rulership of god or under the rulership of the devil

the only thing that is limiting me and you from attaining anything in life is what we know or what we don’t know

individuals who keep growing in knowledge are the ones who succeed

your gifts talents and calling will help you to know what you must do

it is your gifting and talents that dictates to you what to do

the only reason for your intimidation by the devil and your being afraid of him or what he can do is because you are living in ignorance darkness which is his territory

the starting point for greatness is to know what to do with your life

it is rather your limitation that decides to what extent of greatness and to what height you are going to arise in this life your level of promotion in life is determined by how much you know

most people on the face of the earth do not know what to do with their time

you can be in the vanguard of those that bring a change to the community and to the nation as a whole

the difference between one person who is living in poverty and another person living in wealth is their understanding of what to do with time

if you have committed all things to impacting a life at a time or impacting a community or society then welcome to a life of significance

you must know what you do with your time if you must become great in this life

every one of us must learn how to make our time productive

the secret of all greatness is in knowing what to do with time

the secret of all greatness is in knowing what to do with time the secret of all the great men and women in history is that they converted their time into tangible products

you must know what to do with your time if you must become great in this life you must know what to do with your time if you must fulfill your purpose on the earth

most people do not invest their time because they do not see need to do that

you must choose what you do with your time you must not just do things because everybody is doing them

don’t live your life not knowing what to do with your time

it is only those that live intentionally that can accomplish and come to the significance meant for them

what you discover valuable to you can make all the difference in your life

a person could waste an important part of his living if he refuses to come into significance if he refuses to impact lives around the family and in the community or in the society

you need to encourage yourself especially if you know you are on the path of significance

when what you are insulted by meets what you have a strong desire to do then that would bring you significance

if it is only one thing in life that you have or allowed to discover then it must be your significance

go all the way and let your soul be in what you are doing and there will be no limitations

when you live for the purpose of making a difference for the people for society for the things that are beyond you then significance will not be able to elude you

find out what you need to do to express your importance

you need to discover something that will impact humanity

discover what you need to do to make your life have meaning

for your life to have meaning is to discover what you are meant to fulfill

you have to discover what makes you different in your society

it is a good thing to live long but it is much more important to make a difference in life by living a life of significance

a life that is actually lived is one that is with significance

your anger and fury at ungodliness and injustice around you is a license given to you to fulfill a purpose

when you have discovered your significance your life will now begin to move towards making a difference

be prepared to be on the race to fulfill and to achieve fulfillment

in the pursuit of wholeness there will surely be challenges but you need to keep going

your purpose is more than just being happy but it’s about making others to be blessed and happy

each individual needs to be pregnant with the seed of purpose

when your life gets to the stage of being mindful and concerned with impacting and blessing lives then you are pursuing wholeness as an individual

you have to live intentionally as one with a unique purpose and determination

after you have made the discovery of your own significance you would then be able to find the reason to stay alive

everyone desires significance but not everyone is ready to go through the process of being ‘pregnant’ with the requirements that would make them to be significant

to live intentionally implies that it is not going to be always convenient but it is what will take you to significance if you do not give up

every risk that you take in order for you to come into significance is the greatest kind of risk to take

those irritations and uneasiness you are faced with are evidence that you have an assignment to fulfill

finding meaning for life is simply coming into significance because you have been able to accomplish and fulfill your purpose

when you know that you know to the extent of committing your life to a just cause then nothing will be able to stop you

when you are pushed to the wall you will act and do things you have never done before

there is a price for everything in life even what you receive freely has already been paid for by someone

there is no one or a group that would ever be able to achieve or accomplish anything unique except that they are angry with their situation

your anger against every form of insult and oppression must be out of love

whatever it is in life that is worth attaining there must be something that is provoking an individual to go for that thing passionately

the individuals that will stand or speak or act for the sake of the society must be the kind of people that do not accept limitation

if the weeds are removed and there is nothing planted it is the weeds that will keep growing

you are not entitled to stand or speak on behalf of the people or society except that you are already provoked

planting of godliness must be a continuous thing however one needs to start the planting of godliness from the home front

if you are really angry then you must be willing to pay the price of being alone or be remanded for someone else to have their freedom illumination and justice

do not waste your anger you may just be the candidate to deliver a people from oppression or injustice

you and i are to be a true member of the provoked generation

if there is a construction or a pathway in the spirit to be made it is the way of godliness

the truth is that if you do not join the way of godliness then you do not have any reason to complain when the ungodly are busy planning and making the pathway of ungodliness

poverty is a force that pulls down the head of the people

if you are faithful in little things then you will be given a bigger commitment

a fruit that comes forth is the desire and joy for the labour of a farmer

ungodliness has always declared war on godliness

where the spirit of godliness is where there are godly principles in action where there is justice and peace there will surely be prosperity

the group of people that are insulting the society with ungodliness are those that are out rightly known with ungodliness and those that try to mimic godliness

the basic element that will distinguish those that are for godliness from those that are promoting ungodliness is if such individuals possess the spirit of godliness and not just a form of it

it is this spirit of godliness that will bring forth the attributes the principles and the life style of godliness

godliness is not just a doctrine a belief or a principle it has a personality

to embrace the spirit of godliness is to embrace everything godliness stands for

godliness has already come in human flesh to rescue humanity from its own ungodliness

the teaching of godliness must be preached and taught in every available medium

the principles of godliness must be ensured to be received by all in the community city and the nation even by the young and old

the principle of godliness must be believed and embedded as the culture to live by

godliness must be presented with its profit and incentives not only for the good of the nation and society but of eternal value

your anger towards ungodliness towards injustice and the likes will create a hunger in you to fulfill a particular purpose meant for you

individuals with greed for power see others as elements to be oppressed

at the root of every form of ungodliness injustice nepotism selfishness every rivalry and competitive jealousy is the monster called greed

the leaders have the responsibility to protect and hold in high esteem the law and virtues of the land

when greed is enthroned be it in a community or nation ungodliness is celebrated at the altar of human pleasure

the absence of justice anywhere is the presence of injustice everywhere

everyone who fights always fight with a purpose in mind

the oppressor will always despise their victims

until there is equal and fair portion of opportunities apportioned for every citizen the power structure may need to be restructured

every effort to impact someone or a generation will go a long way beyond human imaginations

it is the people that are angry at the status quo that makes a decision to bring change

it is the people who are displeased with injustice that can be a channel for social justice

it is the people who cannot stand oppression that qualifies to fight today’s modern slavery

generational oppression begins when what is meant to be transferred to one offspring has been taken over by reason of oppression

greed is an excessive desire for something more than one’s proper share

as a result of this greed for power the poor is not only silenced but also oppressed

every opportunity every influence and affluence you possess could not have been for you alone but to act as a platform to impact a generation

oppression has been in existence as long as man himself has been in existence

ungodliness is confronting the society and everyone seems to be at its mercy because of greed for pleasure

one of the main roots of ungodliness is being a lover of pleasure more than a lover of god

if there is any society where the leaders lack the knowledge and the importance of justice then oppression will be a common neighbor of the citizens

a desire and a goal not to be subservient to another or to be in charge of one’s life is a good thing to do

a man’s life is not qualified by how much wealth power pleasure or control he has but by the values of godliness he possesses

a leader must be taught or made to know the importance of justice for the people

the light of the kingdom of god remains the strongest weapon for you to fight with in order to have a continuous victory over the enemies

you must be determined to overcome the insults of the ungodliness of this world with the weapon of the light inside of you

a steward in the above scripture is a servant who serves

wherever you are be ready to create the enabling spiritual atmosphere for the sake of the kingdom of god

the kingdom of god is depending on you to make the atmosphere more conducive for the purpose of prospering the kingdom of god

there is definitely a positive aspect of anger such as anger at sin and anger at ungodliness or injustice of the society

there is no one or group of people that would ever be free from bondage without making room for a change

when everybody contributes a change to what he or she notices it is then we will change our world

just an emotional response of sentiments will only lead to tiredness and weariness

to be compassionate you have to forget your own comfort zone and live well because you live beyond yourself

what bothers you today or gives you concerns could be a signpost to your purpose in life

just as you are what you think you are also what you dream

stay with your passion but have a philosophy that is beyond your strength so that you can have a legacy even a legacy that will outlast you

you can be a person with a strong passion or holy anger and be furious in a way that will make the society safer godly with social justice and equity

there is satisfaction in serving

to be able to impact the society and to be an agent of change you have to make yourself available to serve

to be honorable you have to make sacrifices for others

there is no one that cannot make an impact in this world

god loves justice and he desires mankind to love the same

if you see your country going through economic problems the best thing to do is to come up with a strategy plan and vision of how to affect the economy of the nation rather than simply fixing your own individual economic problem

if you are frustrated with the elite of your society do something about it

when you dream of what you want to see whether in your life home community or nation you need to keep watching those dreams until they come to fulfillment

those who fight for social justice and the rights of people will count any other thing as unimportant

anyone that will make a difference would have to put others ahead of them put others first

when every opportunity given to you is used to serve the people you are on the path of life’s purpose to the fullness

don’t underestimate the result of a right and positive anger

serving others is one of the bases for you to have or to enjoy a fullness of purpose in life

to serve others is not only by hands but by mouth as well

your voice can be made loud to speak against ungodliness and injustice and not promote it

if you have experienced injustice and insulted by the ungodliness then you are a candidate to stand against the same

if you are ready to make a difference and shine then you must be ready to pay the price by laboring rightly with your mouth and with hands

the great and the mighty that use their assets and power to subjugate people are demonstrating oppression

covetousness gives birth to violence while violence gives birth to oppression

when you see injustice among the nations you will find out that the root cause is covetousness

the architect and the father of war are covetousness of the leaders and of different interest groups fueling war

if there is anything the leaders in the society or the nations must take note of is to know the importance of justice

when justice is prioritized by any leader at any level then to give justice to the citizenry will always be at the back of the mind of such a leader

you must not allow the hurt of the past to haunt or hinder you from fulfilling and performing your duties as one who has a passion to impact his society and make a change

let your faith be in the lord jesus and not in your strength to fight against ungodliness and injustice in the society

there is still hope that if the people refuse to give up and keep silent no matter how long or inconsequential their voices could be at the beginning it would still be heard and justice be served

those who have been insulted by ungodliness and injustice could be in a good or better position to stand for or with those that are being insulted by the same

there is a commanded blessing on anyone that values esteems and stands for justice in society

whenever you are being insulted by ungodliness and injustice endeavor to speak against it endeavor to stand up against it and expect to see change

you are a lawmaker in your own right

there are people that are to champion the campaign and advocacy against the cycle of ungodliness and injustice in every nation

never misuse your godgiven opportunities it may be the path to fulfilling your destiny

if you are going to speak out against injustice if you are angry at ungodliness in the society then you have the opposing force to contend against

your insult by the ungodliness and injustice in the land is a force

you must build and develop a greater force on the inside of you in this way you will be able to speak and stand against ungodliness and injustice in the land

if lawmakers in nations today refused to be bribed and be corrupted by some largerthanlife leaders the people will be less insulted and molested by ungodliness and injustice

god has individuals he has positioned for his purpose and to be used as his vessel at different time and season

actually everyone in one way or the other is being insulted by ungodliness and injustice be it racial injustice inequality economic injustice and the spread and campaign of ungodliness sweeping the land

in every civilized society there is an established institution put in place to design laws that make people live civilized and having rights and privileges as citizens of that nation

it takes wisdom power and influence to be able to make a positive impact on what goes on in society and in the nation as a whole

the lawmakers possess the authority that commands the obedience of the people

you have received a mandate not given by man but given and empowered by god to bring justice to the people and godliness on the earth

while in bondage the strength of the mind is not put into full action in order to maximize its full potential

to be under a physical bondage or a mental bondage is one of the worst situations someone could ever be in life

when someone finds his or her mind is not free or in mental bondage such a person might as well not be free physically

if a person is not free his right is restricted

your right in a civilized society is to have freedom

the law or any practice that is not for the good of the people must be changed

if we could be humble enough to submit our passions sentiments and even weaknesses to god almighty he would successfully convert them to something positive that would eventually glorify him

when it comes to change feelings like frustrations anger and irritations can easily be converted by each person to become a powerful force of change

the lord is concerned about the poor receiving justice and that they are not neglected or cheated

the philosophy of a person speaks of what dictates or governs how and what someone believes

whatever your passion make sure you hold unto a philosophy that is bigger and greater than you

make sure you are standing for something you believe in

some of the common occurrences of injustice are the presence of poverty starvation gender inequality neglected widows and orphans and the injustice towards other vulnerable groups of people

the human voice is still the most paramount vessel or weapon to use to uphold justice and to protest against injustice

when insulted by injustice face it stand up against it and demand your right and justice

this is the way to shine to make a difference even as you choose to stand up speak out and maintain a valid positive opinion

take a step towards actualizing the very thing you are persuaded for and do not allow injustice to silence your voice

voicing out against injustice in the society is championing a just cause

for any display of displeasure or anger against injustice and ungodliness there is a reward and a godly result

when a hypocrite or a wicked leader is in power anyone that becomes popular or stands out easily becomes a prey

it is those that are insulted by injustice that will refuse to be silenced

you must refuse to succumb to every ungodliness and injustice

a troubled soul is a troubled life

it is the people who are afflicted with ungodliness and injustice that would cry unto the lord for change

a voice of one insulted by injustice will make others to be delivered from the same injustice

for every seed of godliness kindness and justice sowed there will be surely be a harvest of goodness significance and greatness

poverty is possible in every society because someone refused to speak out

there is a level of positive anger that needed to be alive and to make a head way in this life

without a measure of anger against injustice a person a society or a whole nation would have to live perpetually under the bondage of injustice

there is an innate and strong desire in every human being to be heard

make sure you speak out and loud enough to be heard

a sincere decision to make is to refuse to give up until the society experiences the defeat of every form of injustice and ungodliness

the main recipients of injustice in any society are the afflicted the distressed and the troubled one both in soul and in body

you will surely be rewarded for every seed of good deed and godliness

your voice may not be loud today or be heard today but make sure you are still standing on your feet

the afflicted are basically the majority or only set of people who are insulted by injustice in society today

you may be the change and light needed by others to shine on their path

you can become a shining light for others

god is reciprocally responding to the cry of the afflicted

guard yourself with a positive attitude conviction hope and fulfillment of your heart’s desire

individuals should take personal responsibility for knowledge acquisition and campaigns against ignorance

lack of knowledge leads to rejection by god

it is our responsibility to enlighten our people

to some extent it is almost blasphemous to think that insult anger and irritation could be a positive force

to be relevant you must seek knowledge

when you reject knowledge god rejects you

study to show yourself qualified for god’s use

believers must step out of the four walls of the church and take the gospel of the kingdom into every sphere of life

the number one price of ignorance is destruction

god cannot help you in your ignorance

god has no regard for the ignorant

ignorance is a limitation

illiteracy is simply the inability to read and write

we must be true ambassadors of christ on the earth in order to be able to put an end to the plague of ignorance in our society

we have to seek knowledge and infuse ourselves with so much light that can only come from knowledge

your level of knowledge will determine the level at which god relates with you

when we begin to shine the darkness of ignorance will disappear from our society

eradicating ignorance through the establishment of information centers

if we really want to represent god in our day and time we must embrace knowledge

fight against illiteracy

we are not poor because we do not have money we are poor because we do not know how to make money

god’s church need to declare war against ignorance

the church needs to arise not just against total and absolute ignorance the church also needs to arise against halftruth or falsehood which is some of the things that are prevailing in our churches today

you have a right to have a godly anger to bring about change godliness and justice in the society

your level of knowledge determines if you can be a priest for god or not

our passion even our insult could be turned into a blessing

our anger could become a force of deliverance

people who don’t feel insulted by the ungodliness and injustice around them do not do anything about it

heaven will always support your godly move be it a righteous cause or be it a desire to see people free from what has held them down

illiteracy breeds more ignorance than you can ever begin to imagine

when you decide not to discipline yourself to seek for knowledge in any area god sees it as the rejection of knowledge

god calls ignorance the rejection of knowledge which simply means it is actually a choice to be ignorant

the higher the proportion of adults with low literacy proficiency is the slower the overall longterm gdp growth rate is

when you live in light you live under god’s rulership

when you live in darkness you live under the rulership of the devil

there are several grave consequences that come with lack of knowledge the paramount is destruction

knowledge acted upon makes all the difference produces the different results we have in life

it means that the lack of knowledge is the foundation for all life failures destruction depression difficulties hatred bitterness envy etc

there is no other force destroying us like ignorance

it’s like we are having a harvest of destruction in our nations continent and world today all because of ignorance

we must eradicate ignorance and illiteracy from our nations and continent to the nearest minimum for us to have a national development

the only power the devil has is in our area of ignorance

ignorance can stifle learning especially if the ignorant person believes that he or she is not ignorant

a person who falsely believes he or she is knowledgeable will not seek out clarification of his or her beliefs but rather rely on his or her ignorant position

light generates life and causes it to grow

we have to make it a personal responsibility to eradicate ignorance from our society

ignorance leads to destruction

limitations in life are caused by ignorance

it is like we are having a harvest of destruction in our society due to ignorance

we must all raise war against ignorance

ignorance leads to leaving in selfdeception

personal ignorance leads to a negative impact on the society

ignorance leads to economic failures

ignorance leads to low income

illiteracy breeds more ignorance than you can ever imagine

god is helpless in our area of ignorance

the rejection of knowledge ignorance attracts a reaction from god

god has no tolerance for ignorance therefore we should not have tolerance for ignorance also

the devil has no power over us except in our area of ignorance

the reason there’s no oneness and no harmony in the church is because the believers don’t habitually walk in the light and they don’t constantly allow god’s light knowledge to shine in them

ignorance actually limits god from intervening in the misfortunes of our personal lives and that of our society

it is an insult to live in the fear of darkness

let’s stop glorifying the devil giving him power that he does not deserve or have

we are the author of our own destruction

when we live in ignorance we live in darkness and that is where the devil rules

nothing in the whole world is more dangerous than ignorance

every evil we see in our society today can be traced back to ignorance

there is no difference between the person living in ignorance and the person living in darkness

to break yourself loose from the dominion rulership and manipulation of the devil you have to embrace light knowledge

light always overshadows and out powers darkness

darkness is subject to light and can never manifest itself in the presence of light

the only reason for your intimidation by the devil and youre being afraid of him or what he can do is because you are living in ignorance darkness which is his territory

god rules through light

the devil is the reason for all the problems we have in the society

for you to be able to turn on the light in the darkness you have to live in the light

as long as you are ready to pay this price for living in the light knowledge the darkness ignorance becomes a servant to you

we can choose to live under the rulership of god or under the rulership of the devil

if god can only relate with us based on our level of knowledge that means god is limited to our ignorance

the only thing destroying us is ignorance

when there’s darkness there are all kinds of evil things happening rebellion is there and corruption is operating

the instability and disorderliness we have in nigeria today and africa at large is totally due to the absence of this light

we destroy ourselves when we are ignorant or decide to live in ignorance

where there is darkness there is chaos and confusion but when light shines things are set in order and the light rules and governs

life comes from light if we are under god’s shining light life will be generated and the divine life will grow in us

god can only relate with us based on our level of knowledge

god is limited by our ignorance

ignorance is what is destroying us and not the devil

jesus was never indifferent to the issues of the people in his day

when we neglect knowledge we have indirectly rejected light

the devil will do anything for you to be comfortable in your ignorance

god does not have any business with irresponsible people

when people refuse to pay the price of personal responsibility for the problems of the nation these same people end up paying the high price of irresponsibility which is often in tragedy and sorrow

every individual has a role to play for the betterment of our nation

irresponsibility is a sin with a high price tag

if there is anything the devil will want to keep you from having it is knowledge

it is our business to restore the earth back to god through the principles of the kingdom

jesus had the ministry of light knowledge

when there is no personal responsibility in any society there cannot be a responsible government

there is always a great price to pay for irresponsibility

we have to lend our voice to christ by speaking on his behalf

we have to confront ignorance in our nation

it is our business to proffer solution to the problem of the society
